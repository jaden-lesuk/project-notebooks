0,Does wearing masks for a long period of time reduce your oxygen uptake?,"Just like wearing a shoe when one leaves their house, Kenyans have been left with no option but to put on a face mask as the coronavirus continues to surge.Since the first case was reported in March, the government has laid out protocols aimed at reducing the infection rate, among them washing and sanitising hands, maintaining social distance and wearing a face mask.Since then, there has been various misinformation on the effectiveness of these masks with the latest claim being it reduces the uptake of oxygen to the body.  A viral WhatsApp message claiming that wearing a mask for a long time interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels is partly true.The message while referencing an article by Dr. Faheem Younus from the University of Maryland https://archive.vn/jIctm spelled out 17 measures to help people accept that the disease will be around for a while.The ministry of health approved three types of masks which include the N95 respirators, surgical masks and reusable cloth masks.The three were tested for fluid resistance and filtration efficiency.N95 masks are more tightly fitted, making them more likely to inhibit the breathing of the wearer if worn for a prolonged period of time. These are said to filter up to 95 per cent of air particlesSurgical masks, which are disposable, are looser fitting, making it highly unlikely that wearers would see significant depletions in their oxygen intake. They have 90 per cent effectiveness.Cloth masks are porous, allowing air to flow in and out and permitting normal respiratory functions while limiting the release of respiratory droplets. They have between 10 -20 per cent effectiveness.The Star’s fact-check desk contacted an immunologist, Dr Kaikai Kalabusia, who said this depends on the nature of the mask one is wearing.According to the doctor, the government’s recommendation is the N95 mask but due to hard economic times, not many Kenyans can afford this type.As a result, many entrepreneurs have invented imitations of the surgical masks. As per the Kebs regulations, the masks are not authentic and up to the task.   “With pre-existing conditions like asthma and obesity, one will experience difficulty in breathing due to low oxygen levels,” he said.He said there is however no scientific study to really confirm the theory because with the current situation, that has not been the area of focus for many researchers.“In a real sense, a good surgical mask will cost you up to Sh3,500 per pack and not Sh50 or Sh100. With such low-quality masks one is likely to experience expiration or respiration [problem] hence seizures,” he said.The doctor said one does not need to wear a mask while in the house or a less congested office.He said it is common for surgeons and other scientists or healthcare workers to wear the N95 respirators for prolonged periods of time.The ministry’s Centre for Disease Control or the World Health Organization has not issued any warning suggesting the use of these face masks would result in dangerous oxygen level depletion within the general public.Research indicates that reduced oxygen intake level may lead to hypoxemia, a condition where there is low arterial oxygen supply, or hypoxia a condition where the supply of oxygen in tissue is insufficient. Mayo Clinic indicates the amount of oxygen circulating in your blood, ranges from 95-100, with anything below 90% considered low. A fact check done by usatoday.com showed that this misinformation may arise from the feeling of lack of air due to mechanical obstruction depending on the type of mouthpiece one is using. “But the feeling of obstruction is because we are not used to using the mouth mask. But as such it will not cause us any kind of hypoxia,"" Dr. Daniel Pahua Díaz, an academic from the Department of Public Health at the National Autonomous University of Mexico medical school, told Animal Político earlier in May.Based on other fact-checks, the Star rates this claim as PARTLY TRUE since there is no evidence to support it.",PARTLY TRUE
1,"Four Std 8 pupils, two teachers have not succumbed to Covid-19","Information circulating on social media that four class eight pupils have died of Covid-19 in Kisumu is false.The message in a viral video by Standard Media's Spice FM, claimed that a parent identified as Donald had shared his heartbreaking experience after his 12-year old son died of the disease along with his three cube mates.Without naming a particular school or location, the presenter in the show said the incident happened in Kisumu.The presenter said the unnamed pupil reported back to school after the Ministry of Education reopened schools and was a very active footballer before the tragedy struck two weeks later.""Boy goes back to school in Kisumu ... is a very active child... footballer...developed a slight cold and was just sneezing once in a while. Following morning goes to shower with his cube mates.... he falls down and he can’t breath.... the other boys come to his rescue and call two teachers...”“He was rushed to the hospital but unfortunately he passed away after testing positive of Covid-19. It gets sad because the three boys who came to his rescue have also died and the two teachers are in ICU....,” the presenter said in his narration.The story was later published by Kenya ReportThe presenter went on to say that Donald, a divorcee and residing in Kericho County did not have a chance to bury his son because authorities would not allow the body to be transported.This sparked a public outcry with some members of the public asking why the Education CS was risking the lives of many learners by not ordering the closure of schools.The Star’s fact-check got interested on why the father was denied a chance to bury his son at their home yet the government relaxed protocols related to the burial of Covid-19 victims.We reached out to the presenter Erick Latif of the show famously known as 'The SituationRoom' who said they had established that the said person had duped them.According to him, the said parent narrated his ordeal to them and in fact, they had agreed that he goes live on air to share the story.""He switched off his phone when we were about to go live. Out of sympathy, I decided to share his ordeal only to realise later that he was a spinner,"" Latif said.The Ministry of Education through the County Director of Education Kisumu County, Isaac Atebe, in his response, termed the claims as false.Atebe said they had been directed by the ministry to conduct a survey in all public and private boarding schools to establish the claim and to their knowledge, there were no such reports made.""In addition, the county director of public health Kisumu and the County director TSC have confirmed that no pupil was admitted nor any teacher currently in ICU over Covid-19 cases as at November 25,"" Atebe said.The Star thus therefore concludes that the matter is misleading and FALSE.",FALSE
2,PARTLY TRUE: Safaricom calling for registration of next of kin,"A viral WhatsApp message claiming that Safaricom has called on its subscribers to register details of their next of kin is partly true.The message advised the subscribers to dial a certain number to register upon which they would be guided on the process.“Team members, have you registered your M-PESA next of Kin details. To register dial *234*5# then select 6. You will be guided. Do you know SAFARICOM has more than Sh1.7 billion with nobody to claim for lack of next of kin??? . Ensure you know id number and Safaricom number of your next of kin. NOW YOU KNOW!!!,” read the message.We reached out to the communication company to ascertain whether this claim was true which they confirmed to be partly true.Through their PR Company Ogilvy, Safaricom said it was true that it had asked its subscribers to register details of their next of kin but the purported Sh1.7 billion unclaimed money was not true.“We have been informed subscribers once dialling the provided numbers will be guided on how to access the next of kin information through their Bonga account. This is how it was initially designed because it's not linked to M-Pesa,” Susan Wanjiku head of Communication at Ogilvy said.“Safaricom however contacts any customers with unclaimed assets every year before submitting unclaimed funds. So the claim process is true but the unclaimed amount is not factual”.Next of kin is a term used to describe a person's closest living blood relative whom Safaricom may contact in case of any eventuality.Legal representative means a person who is authorized to deal with the estate of a deceased person whether through appointment under a will or by right and thereafter application to a court as per the law.Safaricom requires the claimant to visit any of its retail centers and provide certain documents for inspection and approval before any funds can be released.In the process, the claimant will be required to produce their ID, deceased person’s death certificate, statutory declaration (Affidavit); and letter from provincial administration or confirmation of Grant of Letters of Administration (interstate) or Confirmation of Grant of Probate.Upon receiving notification of the death of a subscriber the M-PESA account is frozen to prevent further dealings and to protect the estate of the deceased.Once all the requisite documents have been provided, funds will be transferred into the beneficiaries entitled to the M-PESA account balances once all documents are found to be in order.The beneficiary must also provide a registered M-PESA account to receive the funds as Safaricom does not pay out money in any other form.",FACT CHECKER
3,Raila's doctors haven't advised him to take a break from work,"A Facebook post claiming that ODM leader Raila Odinga has been asked by his doctors to take a year’s rest is FALSE.The post, which has also been published here by another Facebook user, adds that the doctors warned if Raila does not rest from active duty, he risks suffering “permanent brain and throat damage.”However, Raila's spokesman, Dennis Onyango, has dismissed the claim, terming it propaganda.Speaking to PesaCheck on the phone, Onyango said the former PM is well and continues with his duties as the African Union’s (AU) High Representative for Infrastructure Development in Africa and as the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader.Raila travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo on an official assignment on November 19, where he held a meeting with President Felix Tshisekedi and other government officials, the spokesman added.He also tweeted about his DRC visit on November 20th and 21st.The visit was to review progress on the Grand Inga Hydropower Project on November 20, two days after the post with the claim was published.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming that ODM leader Raila Odinga has been advised by his doctors to take a one year break from active duty and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE
4,Photo claiming journalist shot dead during Bobi Wine arrest not true,"A photo that has been circulating on social media claiming that a Ugandan journalist was shot dead by police is false.The photo, which is also embedded in a Facebook  Post and Twitter Post, indicates that the journalist died after being roughed up by police while covering National Unity Platform presidential candidate, Robert Kyagulanyi, famously known as Bobi Wine.The photo was also widely shared on WhatsApp platforms. The Star’s fact-check desk, using google search tools, established that the photo was taken in 2015.According to Human Rights Network for Journalists Uganda- HRJNU, the journalist is identified as Isaac Kugonza.The organisation said the journalist then working with Delta TV, a local television channel, was attacked while covering a scuffle surrounding efforts to arrest the Lord Mayor of Kampala City, Erias Lukwago, in November 16, 2015.Police had fired teargas, rubber and live bullets to disperse Lukwago’s supporters who were opposed to efforts by police to block him from reaching the electoral commission headquarters in Kampala to return his mayoral nomination papers. In an online Article, the journalist was shot by police on the head and rushed to Mulago National Referral hospital in critical condition.The article said blood was oozing from his head and spate in the mouth with his editor Prossy Margaret Kisitu saying that his skull had been cracked.He was the third journalist to be shot while covering political events in less than two months. But Police Spokesperson Fred Enanga while dismissing the claims said the journalist was hit with a stone hurled at the police by rowdy protesters and not by a bullet.We further established that the photo of a camera stained with blood was taken by a Reuters photojournalist in 2017 after an explosion in Mogadishu Somalia. The star, therefore, concludes the claims that the incident happened recently during the arrest of Bobi Wine is FALSE.",FALSE
5,Image of Ruto with a panga as he addresses crowd is altered,"A photo shared on Facebook appearing to show Deputy President William Ruto holding a panga is ALTERED.In the photo, the deputy president appears to be holding a panga in his right hand and a microphone on the left as a huge crowd throngs his motorcade. The text on the post says, “Ruto has been staging attacks to attract sympathy.”However, a Google reverse image search and an online search reveals that the original photo, which was first seen online in October 2020, shows Ruto addressing a crowd and gesturing with his right hand. The open palm has no panga. The only item he is holding is the microphone in his left hand.The image was captured when Deputy President William Ruto addressed residents of Githurai in Kiambu county, on his way to Nairobi after attending a church service in Murang’a on October 5.PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Facebook claiming to show Deputy President William Ruto holding a panga and finds it to be ALTERED.",ALTERED
6,President Trump did not refer to Republicans as 'dumbest' voters,"A magazine photo claiming that US President Donald Trump referred to Republican voters as ‘dumbest voters’ is false.The photo- that has gone viral on social media platforms quotes the Peoples Magazine in 1998, where it is alleged Trump said if he were to dip his toes in politics, he would use the Republican ticket.“If I were to run, I’d run as a Republican. They’re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they’d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific,” read the message purporting to be a quote from Trump. Several Twitter users including  Azeem Butt ValryLeBourg and MuthuiMkenya in reference to the ongoing US election indicated that one does not have to be smart if their followers are stupid.While the quote has been debunked several times since it apparently surfaced in 2015, users have recently been resharing it on social media especially after a Democratic Candidate Joe Biden was projected as the President-Elect for the United States.The Star’s fact-check desk established that the meme was first debunked by SNOPES in 2015, followed by other independent debunks.The magazine’s spokesperson Julie Farin had told Factcheck.org, “People looked into this exhaustively when it first surfaced back in Oct. (2015). We combed through every Trump story in our archive. We couldn’t find anything remotely like this quote–and no interview at all in 1998”.According to the fact-check, in 1998, Trump was cited frequently in the pages of People, but at the time, most of the stories were about his pending divorce from Marla Maples and appearances at various social and entertainment events.Other outlets including CNN, AP, REUTERS, The Journal.ie, Business Insider and FACTCHECK.ORG have published articles debunking the claim.FACTCHECK.ORG  in their article said People’s magazine archive showed Trump did appear in the publication in the 1990s, but the coverage was mostly centered on his personal relationships. The article indicated there were several stories in the late 1990s about Trump’s desire with a presidential run. (This became a running theme for Trump, who claimed he was considering a run for president in 1988, 2000, 2004 and 2012).Another fact-check done by REUTERS  indicates that on September 2, 1987, shortly after releasing a full-page newspaper ad criticizing U.S. foreign policy, Trump identified himself as a Republican during an interview with CNN’S Larry King.Trump told King that he had no interest in running for president.In December 1987, People published a profile on Donald Trump titled “Too Darn Rich”. The article quoted him saying he was too busy to run for president ( here ).Most iterations of the meme feature a photo of Trump during an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1988 when he said he would probably not run for president but wouldn’t rule it out.While other articles and interviews from the late 1980s and 1990s show Trump did publicly speak about his political affiliations and the possibility of running for office ( here ), there is no evidence of him ever saying the alleged quote or making any similar statement.According to SNOPES, while the Fox News Channel was rolled out across major American news markets between 1996 and 2000 (and thus isn’t entirely chronologically out of place in a circa-1998 quote), the network wasn’t nearly as prominent or widely watched until the 2000 election of George W. Bush, the September 11th attacks in 2001, and the start of the Iraq War in 2003.Before that time, although Fox News was making its way into living rooms across the United States, it was not exceptionally well-known (or particularly regarded as a right-leaning outlet) in 1998.The Star’s verdict is that the meme with the quote attributed to President Trump is bogus and false. This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FALSE
7,Poster advertising youth meeting 'hosted' by Ruto is fabricated,"A Facebook post promoting a youth consultative meeting on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) to be hosted by Kenya’s deputy president, William Ruto, is Fake.The post was also shared by other Facebook pages, including Kenya Daima and Bigwig Kenya News.The meeting is set to bring together youth leaders from Nairobi’s Mathare, Kibera and Dagoretti areas, but there is no indication on the poster when this will take place.Attendees are promised an allowance of Sh20,000 and anyone interested is asked to contact the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lang’ata constituency, Nixon Korir and his Dagoretti South counterpart, John Kiarie, through numbers provided. The post above the flier appears to throw a jibe at the DP for his position over the BBI report, saying the ‘train’ has already left for a progressive future of Kenya.“The main agenda for some individuals is to derail Kenya from prosperity and a more united Kenya,” reads the post.During the recent launch of the BBI report at the Bomas of Kenya, Dr Ruto faulted a number of the proposals contained in it and asked proponents of the report to persuade him, and millions of Kenyans he claimed to represent, otherwise.“We must strive progressively to have a negotiated constitutional settlement or to arrive at a place where we are all working together building consensus,” he said at the event.The DP took issue with the proposal to have an ombudsman appointed by the executive to the judiciary, which he termed as a derogation from the independence of the judiciary.The Facebook group where the poster was shared — Every Hustle Matters — describes itself as the official team organising and campaigning for Dr Ruto’s presidential bid.However, responding to a query by PesaCheck, Emmanuel Talam, the director of communication in the deputy president’s office, disowned the poster and termed the claim as “nonsense”.Lang’ata MP Mr Nixon Korir, whose contact is listed in the poster in question, also dismissed the poster as a fabrication. PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a poster promoting a youth consultative meeting on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) to be hosted by deputy president, William Ruto, and finds it to be fake.",FACT CHECK
8,Photo does not show Raila Odinga being chased away by a mob,"A photo shared on Facebook claiming to show ODM leader Raila Odinga being chased away by an angry mob on October 30, 2020, is a HOAX.The caption says the mob demanded that Raila should champion inclusivity in the Building Bridges Initiative. It, however, doesn’t mention the location of the incident.The BBI report was launched at the Bomas of Kenya on October 26. The initiative — the brainchild of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila was conceived in March 2018 in the famous “Handshake” agreement that ended months of post-election demonstrations and confrontations. Dozens were killed by the police.A reverse image search shows that the photo was published on November 17, 2017, when Raila returned to Kenya after boycotting the rerun of the presidential elections held that year. The photo is credited to Jeff Angote of the Nation Media Group.The photo in the post doesn’t show Raila being chased away from a rally by an angry mob on October 30.PesaCheck has looked into a photo shared on Facebook claiming to show ODM leader Raila Odinga being chased away by an angry mob on October 30, 2020, and finds it to be a HOAX.",HOAX
9,Advert for free courses from the NYS is not legitimate,"A poster shared on Facebook claiming that the National Youth Service (NYS) is offering free courses for servicemen and women is FAKE.The poster, which appears to have been printed on page 10 of an unidentified publication, lists a number of certificate and diploma courses that interested applicants can pursue with the NYS for free.The certificate courses include plumbing, electrical installations, carpentry and joinery, masonry, driving, building and construction. The diploma courses listed are computer science, engineering skills, accounting technicians and forestry management among others.The poster says applicants must be Kenyan citizens, must undergo a COVID-19 test and be ready to undertake their prefered course in any part of Kenya.Applicants for the certificate courses are expected to have attained grades between E to D+, the post adds, while those applying for the diploma course much have scored C- to C+. While this grading system is similar to the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) the post does not say in which examination applicants must attain the grades.Applications are to be sent by email to a yahoo webmail account by November 2, 2020, indicating the course the applicant wishes to undertake, their county and sub-county of residence as well as their telephone number.The post also includes what appears to be a photo of the post’s author and a message that encourages the public to apply for the courses.However, neither the poster nor its contents are published on the NYS website, as is the norm with all recruitment of youth to join the voluntary program for Kenyan citizens, according to the guidelines under the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) tab.The FAQs section highlights the fact that recruitment to the NYS is carried out twice a year and the minimum academic qualification is a KCSE grade D plain. There is no provision for an E grade as claimed in the poster.The NYS website also says that during recruitment exercises, applicants are normally asked to present themselves in their areas when announced, rather than email their applications as claimed by the poster in question.On October 28, 2020, the NYS tweeted a screenshot of the poster, terming it fake and labelling it a scam.PesaCheck has looked into the poster shared on Facebook and claiming that the National Youth Service is offering free courses for servicemen and women and finds it to be FAKE.",FAKE

Kindly avoid them at all costs,” said a tweet by the supermarket chain.Facebook Transparency Information for the imposter page shows it was created on March 25, 2019, while that of the legitimate Quickmart Supermarket page was created on July 3, 2015.PesaCheck has previously debunked similar claims that Quickmart is offering jobs at a fee, including one alleging the retailer was seeking to employ over 900 staff, and the other advertising 2800 positions at the supermarket, all of which were false.In both cases, the scammers use Google forms to develop online application forms and regularly update minor details such as hiring dates, the amount of money to be paid as registration fees and the number of job openings among other things.PesaCheck has looked into Google form shared on a Facebook page claiming that Quickmart Supermarket has advertised 1,043 new jobs and finds it to be a HOAX.",HOAX
12,Two ladies spotted with Governor Oparanya during Mashujaa Day aren't his wives,"A photo that has been circulating on social media claiming Kakamega Governor, Wycliffe Oparanya, entered Kisii Stadium with his two wives is misleading.The photo showing Oparanya alongside two ladies has been used on various online publications and social media platforms.Opera News in an article published on October 20, claimed that Oparanya’s entrance with the two wives for the ceremony indicated a man that respects and supports women in the country. “Leaders arrived in style as the majority of them were in the company of their wives. But something that was noticed by Kenyans was the two women that accompanied the Kakamega governor Oparanya,” read part of the article.It further read, “The chair of the council of governors and an ODM member came in style with his two wives. Kenyans have applauded him as a true gentleman for his act. He showed Kenyans and leaders at large that polygamy wasn't something to be ashamed of”.Another online publication Breaking News.co.ke, splashed a headline dubbed, ‘Kenyans Admire the Love between Oparanya’s Two Wives after they accompanied Him to the Mashujaa Day Celebration’.According to the article, Kenyans were left adoring the harmonious relationship that the two wives portrayed at the ceremony.“The two women were pictured walking beside the Head of the council of Governors as they made their way to the VIP podium. This is deemed as a rare occurrence since many polygamous families are often marred with chaos and unending competition,” the article read.“Priscillah Oparanya and Caroline Oparanya have now left Kenyan women in polygamous marriages picking lessons of peaceful coexistence. The two have been serving as the first ladies of the Oparanya led county for a period of 8 years now. The ODM party leader has umpteenth terms warned his opponents not to use his marriage status to dissuade voters.” The article goes on to reference other political leaders in polygamous marriages like outspoken Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and Cotu boss Francis Atwoli. A Twitter user Disembe Disembe also posted the photo on his timeline saying “I gather that Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya attended Mashujaa Day with his two wives. Reminds me of Budalangi MP Raphael Wanjala and his battle with the Parliamentary Service Commission to provide medical cover to all his wives and their children”.As a result, Disembe said African men must decently normalise the institution of polygamy, a very important social institution at a time the ratio of men to women in Kenya isn’t even.“LUHYA men are trying. Wanjala, Atwoli, Oparanya. Better than that wheelbarrow guy with his 30 kids and hidden mothers,” he said.But the Star’s fact-check desk established that the two ladies are MCAs and not Oparanya’s wives.We reached out to the governor who indicated that one of the ladies is the Member of County Assembly for Nyamira and the other Member of County Assembly for Kisii.“I was in a convoy that had left Kisii Governor James Ongwae’s home where we spent the night. On arrival at the gate, we had to alight for security screening. When I was cleared I made my way to the stadium and coincidentally we found ourselves walking side by side,” the governor said.He said the two nominated MCAs are equally surprised to read in social media that they are being referred to as his wives.The Star could not however immediately identify the two MCAs.The governor sent us a photo of him alongside his two wives just to settle the matter.The Star concludes that the claim that Oparanya arrived at the ceremony in the company of his two wives is therefore misleading.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FACT CHECK

It should not be about how leaders will be benefited but how the economy will be uplifted.  In this journey, we should not look for ways that will divide but bring together and if we are genuine about the BBI, we must start with such discussion,"" he said.Ruto said while looking for inclusivity advocated for in the report, there must be mechanisms to look out for the millions who have been excluded because of economic status.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FALSE
14,FACT CHECK: Photo of Ruto 'opposing' his 2022 presidential bid is fake,"A viral image has emerged showing Deputy President William Ruto visiting a shop with a message that 'mocks' his 2022 presidential bid.The image shows the DP in the company of Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga in front of a shop with an inscribed message that reads, “Ruto will never be President”.Despite some believing the validity of this image, the Star sought to establish the picture's origin and concluded it is a fake and is actually a doctored version of a separate picture.  Data from CrowdTangle, Facebook’s public insights tool, shows the post has been shared dozens of times, attracting thousands of reactions.A reverse image search reveals that the photo is barely two weeks old and has been photo-shopped.Among those who shared is a Facebook user Amb Hon Paul Wachira.The original image has been proven to be a picture of Ruto in Bungoma County in September where he was attending a church service in Bumula constituency.The image was taken by the Deputy President Press Service with the only details conflicting between the original image and the doctored being a tag on the shops’ barrier.In the original photo, the tag gives details on how the customer can pay using their mobile phones.However, in the second image, the payment details have been manipulated to read “Ruto will never be President” Local news platforms used a series of images to report the Bumula visit which came in the midst of regulations limiting public gatherings as part of coronavirus restriction. The intention of the fake inscribed message is believed to have been satire, and probably provocation to DP supporters.A follow up by the Star on the DPs Twitter handle also shows a series of photos, on the same event leading to the photo in question.In the photos dated September 27 DP’s tweet reads, “Enjoyed a bottle of soda with fellow hustlers at Mama Mary’s Ebenezer shop after a Sunday service in Bumula. May God bless Mama Mary’s hustle”. This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FALSE
15,FACT CHECK: All learners have not been directed to return to school on October 26,"An online post suggesting that all learners will be required to report back to school for in-person learning from October 26 is FAKE.The post appears in two websites – CHECK-POINT.CO.KE and republished by Opera News.Data from CrowdTangle, Facebook’s public insights tool, shows the post has been shared dozens of times, attracting thousands of reactions. The post on Opera news reads “all students in pre-primary one and two, Grades one to three, Classes five to seven and those in form 1, 2, and 3 will return to school from October 26 to November 2, 2020.,”Schools in Kenya began to reopen for in-person teaching on October 12 with KCPE, KCSE candidates and Grade 4 learners reporting back first.The candidates’ return was to give ample time for preparation of the national exams that are set to be conducted between April and June of 2021.Teachers were directed to report back to school earlier to prepare for the safe return of students in the examination classes.However, the Education Ministry is yet to state when the subsequent classes will be required to return for in-person teaching and learning.The Education CS while announcing the first phase of resumption of in-person learning said that the first two weeks would be used to inform the reopening of subsequent classes.Basic Education Principal Secretary, Belio Kipsang in a phone interview told the Star that the government is yet to direct resumption of teaching and learning for other grades, terming reports contrary to that as malicious. Kipsang says plans are underway for the government to give proper guidance and dates on resumption.In May, Education CS George Magoha appointed a 10-member task force chaired by Sarah Ruto to craft the reopening of learning institutions in the country in the era of Covid-19.The taskforce in a report submitted to the Education Ministry, the cabinet and the President recommended schools adopt a phased reopening approach.The report was, however, is not made public.Kenya Secondary School Heads Association chairperson Indimuli Kahi in a phone interview with the Star said schools are yet to get any directives on when in-person learning will resume for the rest of the classes.The post also suggests that medical staff and some officers from the Ministry of health will stand at respective school entrances, to take students' temperatures before proceeding to the school compound.However, this is contrary to the guidelines issued by the Education ministry that require teachers and other school staff to take charge of monitoring learners' temperatures.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FALSE
16,FACT CHECK: Video predicting Asian virus recording not from 1956,"A viral video predicting the Asian virus in 1956 is false.The video widely shared on YouTube and social media platforms claimed that it had been predicted in 1956 that a deadly virus originating from Asia would hit the world.“Can you believe this? It was made 64 years ago!. This recording was made on 29 2 1956 i e 64 years ago Listen to the last 40 seconds of recording,” read a description on the video.But the Star’s fact-check found it to be satirical and misleading.How did it start?A YouTuber by the name Ramses the Pigeon, posted this video on his channel on February 29 saying it was hilarious to look back on what people from the 1950s thought the future would look like.On the channel with 3.48k subscribers, Ramses who is based in the US said the archival and public domain footage used in the creation of the video was obtained from archive.org.He went on and put a disclaimer saying, “Also, yes, I only threw this together because I wanted to have a video uploaded on February 29”.The video has so far received over 200,000 views.Various You Tubers picked the said video and posted on their respective channels between March and September. The video, however, went viral when a Dallas Hill-based NGO posted it on their website.Unify The People -Constitution whose mission is to educate and inform Sovereigns about the ills of globalism and the globalist agenda on their channel with over 5.01 k viewers amplified it saying, “Can you believe this? It was made 64 years ago!. This recording was made on 29-2-1956 ie 64 years ago.. Listen to the last 40 seconds of recording”.With such a huge following, the video got 141,587 views with over 100,000 likes and 136 comments.Ramses, without knowing how the misinformation had spread, started trending.A YouTuber MIG MAG on October 3,  apologised to his subscribers for posting the video on his channel without knowing it was fake.Immediately, fact-checkers from Belgium, France, and The Netherlands started reaching out to him and on October 7, he came out publicly to say that the majority of the video content was absurd satire.“I created this satirical piece shortly after COVID-19 started being recognized as a genuine threat. In the months that followed, quite a few different people ripped, cut, and shared incomplete versions of the video across a variety of social media sites. Worse still, many of those individuals insisted that they were presenting “proof” of the pandemic having been intentionally engineered,” Ramses said.He added, “Given that my original upload barely passed 60,000 views, I was entirely unaware of this… until fact-checkers from Belgium, France, and The Netherlands started reaching out to me. In the days that followed, I learned how far the “misinformation” had spread, and I found myself explaining not only that that the majority of my video content is absurd satire (like “The Mick Jagger Conspiracy Theory""), but that the viral piece in question was intended to lampoon the anti-science perspectives which were arising at the time”.He said predictably, the news articles containing the truth haven’t spread nearly as far as the doctored videos, and it was only yesterday when Snopes confirmed that my piece was a joke.The Star’s fact-check desk using Google search tools further established that some of the footage Ramses used had been compiled from various old movies including the  ‘Leave it to roll-oh’ produced in 2016, the 2021 Chevy Tahoe Z71 exhibition in December 2019 and the ‘Darkness’, a 2002 supernatural horror film.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FALSE
17,Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is yet to be appointed WTO director,"Information circulating on Social media claiming that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a Nigerian has been appointed as the new Director General of World Trade Organization (WTO) is false.The Star’s fact check desk can authoritatively say that though Ngozi is among the two candidates who have proceeded for the last round in the WTO race, her appointment is yet to be made.The 7th Director-General of WTO will be officially made on October 29 after consultations by the General Council.  Shadrack Musembi had on his twitter https://archive.is/fJpDM  posted as breaking news claiming that Ngozi has been appointed as the new Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO).He said shattering a glass ceiling, Ngozi is the first female African leader of this organization.The same message was widely shared on other social media platforms including WhatsApp.The news about her appointment came after WTO members announced that only together with Yoo Myung-hee of the Republic of Korea would proceed to the final round.“Based on the depth and breadth of preferences articulated to the facilitators, Amb. Walker told a Heads of Delegation meeting on 8 October that the two candidates who secured the broadest and deepest support from the membership and who should subsequently advance to the final round are Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria and Yoo Myung-hee of the Republic of Korea,” read a statement from WTO.The two candidates were chosen from a field of five that had advanced to the second round of consultations including Kenya’s Sports CS Amina Mohamed.As the members move to the final round of consultations, the ultimate objective is to secure a consensus decision by members on the next Director-General. “Our aim continues to be to encourage and facilitate the building of consensus among members and to assist in moving from this final slate of two candidates to a decision on the appointment. As this is the final round of the consultation process, it should bring us to the point where we can make a recommendation to the General Council concerning that decision,” Amb. Walker said.The General Council is the highest decision-making body of the WTO apart from the Ministerial.The New Zealand ambassador said the third phase of consultations will commence on 19 October and run until 27 October to afford members sufficient time to prepare their positions. Another factor in waiting a week for stage three to begin is the busy calendar of meetings next week, including a scheduled two-day session of the General Council, which Amb. Walker will chair.During this period, WTO members will be asked in confidential consultations to express to the facilitators a single preference and based on these preferences, the troika will deliver their assessment on which of the two candidates is most likely to command a consensus of the membership and become the seventh Director-General of the World Trade Organization. Amb. Walker will then call a formal General Council and present the troika's recommendation to the membership for a formal decision.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FALSE

However, during refilling, one will be charged the usual retail price, it says.A link  https://freegastotal.info/book-now/ provided gives the terms and conditions.“We have refined this online booking/application process to make it fast and easy for you to book the gas cylinders. To be eligible for a FREE GAS CYLINDER: You must be a Kenyan citizen aged above 18 years with a valid National ID,”  read some of the conditions.Beneficiaries are expected to have a phone number that can easily be contacted by the 'Total Gas Distribution Team anytime'.“After booking, you will be notified of the status of your application within 10 minutes. The gas cylinder will be delivered to you within a maximum of 3 days,” read the terms.Beneficiaries are then asked to pay a delivery fee of Sh450 for the 6kg cylinder and Sh550 for the 13kg cylinder to Dr Ismael Ondiek, head of procurement.“This fee is however automatically REFUNDED if your booking is rejected. You will NOT PAY any other fee because the cost of the gas cylinder has been catered for by Total gas,” reads the message.The Star’s fact-check desk looked into this advert and established it to be a hoax.The link provided in the advert https://freegastotal.info/?fbclid=IwAR1xPV_oWcsJVxUwMFzI5TYtzVAwQpiennLS6kL3B0Y_vA3PbwzTFPU73tE does not belong to Total Kenya.The company's site is https://www.total.co.ke/promotions/nunua-total-lpg-cylinder.The fraudsters took advantage of a promotion that Total has been running called Nunua Total LPG+Cylinder at  https://www.total.co.ke/promotions/nunua-total-lpg-cylinder to con unsuspecting Kenyans.When contacted, Total confirmed they had seen the fake advert.A similar advert has been run with the names of other gas distributors such as Progas https://www.facebook.com/Free-Gas-Cylinders-From-Progas-100879968439651/This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FAKE NEWS
19,Prostate cancer rampant among boda boda riders,"Last month, an online article claimed that boda boda riders in the country are at more risk of contracting prostate cancer.The article, published on ‘Tujipange’ website,  https://www.tujipange.com/2020/08/prostate-cancer-impotence-rampant-among-boda-boda-riders-kenyan-urologist/ on August 20 quoted a research conducted in 2008 by doctors from Japan, which indicated vibrations and the electromagnetic waves emanating from the bike in motion could lead to one contracting prostate cancer.The studies further explained that the men who rode motorcycles at least three times a week were seven times more susceptible to falling victims to the condition. Another article published in the Standard https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/lifestyle/article/2000179565/motorbike-riders-risk-impotence-and-cancer  claimed that most motorcycles put undue pressure on the perineum, the area between the anus and the scrotum, and restricted blood flow to the penis.According to the article, vibrations from the engine also cause a decrease in two growth hormones in the bladder and prostate, related to bladder relaxation.“Various types of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field radiations are linked to health disorders including cancer. Millions of motorcycles generate excessive magnetic radiation up through the seat penetrating directly into the rider's groin and torso. The prostate is of major concern as it is one of the closest delicate glands invaded by the radiation,” read part of the article.But is the claim true?The Star’s fact-check desk reached out to Urologist Dr. Peter Mungai who dismissed the reports, indicating that there was no scientific evidence to back the claim.According to the doctor, prostate cancer has been in existence way before the introduction of motorcycles as a means of transportation.Mungai said though it has not been established what really causes the cancer, doctors know it begins when some cells in the prostate become abnormal. He said the mutations in the abnormal cells' DNA cause the cells to grow and divide more rapidly than normal cells do.The abnormal cells continue living when other cells would die.The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor that can grow to invade nearby tissue. Some abnormal cells can also break off and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.Mungai said prostate cancer is mainly associated with family history.For instance, if men in your family have had prostate cancer, your risk may be increased.According to the doctor, if you have a family history of genes that increase the risk of breast cancer (BRCA1 or BRCA2) or a very strong family history of breast cancer, your risk of prostate cancer may be higher.We sought a second opinion from Nairobi's Cancer registry.Anne Korir in charge of the registry said there is no evidence that can link cancer to boda boda operation.According to her, the data collected is second hand from doctors who, while taking details from patients, do not include occupation.We established that prostate cancer is ranked at position 4 among deadly cancers.In position one is breast cancer with 5,985 patients, followed by cervix cancer with 5,250 patients, oesophagus with 4,380 and prostate with 2,864 patients.This is an equivalent of 12.5 per cent, 11 per cent, 9 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.Although prostate cancer is at position two among types of cancer in men, it has the highest number of new cases reported compared to oesophagus cancer which is ranked position one.According to data from the Motorcycle Assemblers Association of Kenya, by 2018, there were over 600,000 commercial motorcycles in the country.This number is expected to have risen to about one million this year.About 4.8 million people in Kenya rely on motorcycles for their daily operations.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",UNPROVEN

21,FALSE: Teaching colleges have not called for applications from D+ students,"A Facebook post suggesting that teacher training colleges have opened applications for students who scored grade D+ (Plus) is fake.The post claimed that students who finished schooling in 2016/2017 and have an aggregate of D+ and above in their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education are asked to apply for P1 teaching courses.""Interested candidates are asked to make manual applications and submit them to the Sub-County Director of Education office for second intake admission. “Officers at respective sub-counties are desperately waiting for them.  Please pass to our communities using all channels of communication including churches,” the post read.The Star's fact-check investigated the claim in the post and established it as false.In fact, the government halted admission of trainees to teaching colleges in 2019 under a plan to advance the training model.Currently, the entry requirement for a certificate training in a teacher's colleges in the country is Grade C- (minus).Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang in an interview said teacher colleges are currently not admitting new students to allow for upgrading of the coursework to fit the new education system.The plan, Kipsang revealed was to have the institutions resume admission this year but that was cut short by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.“The first group of students will join the institutions in May next year after we froze admission in January 2019,” Kipsang said. Kipsang also revealed that the new teacher training program will affect the current entry qualification and push it to Grade C (plain) in the KCSE exams.Teachers Service Commission, the government agency responsible for the registration and employment of teachers in the country also termed the post fake.TSC director of communication Beatrice Wababu, said the commission is the entity with the legal mandate to prescribe entry qualification, register and employ teachers in the country.A controversial plan to admit students with grade D+ (Plus) was hatched in 2019 but was short-lived after the Teachers Service Commission fought it arguing it would compromise the quality of teachers.The plan was an arrangement by the then Education CS Amina Mohamed as a crash program to quickly address the teacher shortage in the country.Disgruntled by the decision, TSC sought legal advice from the Attorney General. In November 2019, AG Kihara Kariuki said the Education CS had no such powers.He said only the TSC has the mandate to prescribe entry qualifications pushing the Education ministry to back down and withdraw the notice.Those who had been admitted were also forced to switch to other courses that match their entry qualifications in Technical colleges.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",

Hurry up!! So far 291,304 Kenyans have received their Sh3,300 funding package,"" reads a disclaimer below the link.To give it a more authentic touch a comment section resembling the Facebook layout is also displayed at the bottom of the page.Irrespective of the number of times you visit the site, the purported  'beneficiaries' and timestamp in the comments read 'just now' for all and 'two mins ago' for one comment. This remains constant.Suspiciously enough, the website also lacks any institutional, physical or personal address or phone number. The Star reached out to the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection that has in the past been responsible for the distribution of such funds. PS Nelson Marwa said currently they are engaged in a programme to protect the vulnerable in the society but dismisses availability of any relief funds for the coronavirus period. This was also confirmed by  Julius Muia, the Principal Secretary at the National Treasury.""Currently, the government is focussed on the social protection programme that provides Sh2,000 monthly to the elderly, widows and orphaned families... This done through the Ministry of interior and coordination,"" Marwa said in a phone interview.After checking on social media to see who and where this information may have been shared previously and, perhaps, track its source, we found out that the hoax has been shared in other countries such as Ghana, Uganda, South Africa and Nigeria but with different amounts of currencies in the respective countries.The Star thus concludes that the claim in the viral post is false and a hoax.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FACT CHECK
23,"MISLEADING: 2,600 students didn't miss university places","A post by a local television station, Citizen, claiming that over 2,632 students scored a C plus and above in the 2019 KCSE exams missed university places is misleading.The post, published and aired on April 27 on the Citizen TV https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3R2-5N6RTM   claimed that the students, despite qualifying for a university place, did not secure admission.While this is true, it is not the case to the claim that they missed places, rather, the Kenya University and Colleges Central Placement Services says the students opted for diploma courses in polytechnics and technical institutions. When asked about this, KUCCPS chief executive John Muraguri said: “This was a deliberate choice, remember, universities declared a higher number of capacity than the number of students who qualified to join the institutions so it will be misleading to say that some students missed places.” Out of 689,007 students who sat for the 2019 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination, only 125,463 students who attained mean grades of C+ were eligible for placement to university as government-sponsored students.So too, John Muraguri, the KUCCPS chief executive also notes that the government does not fund education for non-Kenyan nationalities.This means that those who are not Kenyan students also missed university places. They, however, are eligible to apply to various institutions as private international students.“We also did not consider students who are not Kenyans, the government only funds Kenyans and the simple explanation is that the government is training human resources thus wouldn’t want to lose those it trains because they are foreigners,” Muraguri said in a phone conversation.Institutions of higher learning charge this kind of student at different rates compared to Kenyan nationalities.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FACT CHECK
24,FACT CHECK: Do Eucalyptus trees cause reduction of water level in rivers?,"Last month, Murang'a County Woman Representative, Sabina Chege,called for an end to the planting of eucalyptus trees on grounds that they cause reduction of water levels in rivers.On her Facebook page, the MP claimed she had met KTDA officials at the Gituamba eucalyptus plantation and agreed not to replant the trees because water levels in a local river had reduced.After public outrage on her comments, the MP pulled down the post but rephrased her statement, defending her sentiments on why she wanted the forest ‘done away with’.“Today, I spent the better part of the day on a development tour within Kinyona Ward. I inspected the Gituamba Power line together with Rural Electrification Authority Officials and later met with KTDA officials in Gituamba Eucalyptus plantation, where they were planning to replant the same trees, days after harvesting those that were planted seven years ago against the wish of Kinyona residents. I informed them of the views and complaints of the residents despite several outcries therebefore,” she said.“This community land must be used for the public good. The current use (planting eucalyptus woodfuel) is not for the local public good. The land is currently used by KTDA holdings and her managed factories (which are privately registered) as a source of their firewood project. Currently, Eucalyptus trees ( Minyua mai) are rejuvenating on the land for the wood fuel program by KTDA,” she added.Chege said she was of the opinion that the land should be used in a more productive manner,  with less negative impact to the people.She argued that the eucalyptus trees had impacted the area negatively, including reducing the water flow on the Kanyona River.https://www.facebook.com/HonSabinaChegeBut are these claims true?The Star’s fact check desk contacted Benjamin Wamugunda, a senior forester and the National Chairman of the Forestry Society of Kenya.In his response, Wamugunda said eucalyptus trees have been demonised for a long time due to wrong reasons.He said just like any other plantation, eucalyptus only uses water during photosynthesis to produce wood.“It is wrong to say that eucalyptus are to blame for the reduction of water in any place. That is a strange reason one would use to demonise a tree species,” he said.Wamugunda’s sentiments are backed by a report by Kenya Forest Services on the eucalyptus and water use.According to KFS, a lot of concern has been expressed on the effect of eucalyptus trees on the hydrological patterns, with various claims that their presence on the landscape is causing the drying up of water sources, rivers and springs.KFS said these claims have not been conclusively supported by scientific evidence.“However, studies have established that eucalypts exhibit high efficiency in water use for biomass accumulation,” read part of the report.For example, it has been established that eucalyptus requires less water to produce one (1) kg of biomass than most crops.Some comparative data to support this is as follows:  Eucalyptus species require on average 785 litres Cotton / coffee / bananas each require 3,200 litres Sunflower requires 2,400 litres Maize, potato and sorghum require 1,000 litres each According to KFS, the effects of eucalyptus on the water budget will depend on the species in question, climate, soil conditions, nature of rock substratum, vegetative cover, slope, tree growth stage, and tree density and amount of rainfall.A senior scientist at the World Agroforestry said hydrological studies are needed in order to evaluate available water in the system, its use and losses. Dr. Sammy Carsan says, unfortunately, in most situations available long-term studies are lacking to evaluate the role of eucalyptus on water use and losses. He said while some studies exist and there is feedback to determine the impacts of eucalyptus on water use, one has to look at the total coverage of plantations in a given landscape rather than few isolated tree stands or woodlots on-farm plots.“Decision to plant eucalyptus need to be informed by management knowledge on correct eucalyptus species for a given site but also more crucially an evaluation on whether the available land can support its production. It’s crucial to remember that eucalyptus is a plantation species with high efficiencies for wood biomass production- for this to happen, there is the demand for soil nutrients and water,” he said.Carsan said currently, there are no empirical studies done in the country to support the theory that eucalyptus are high water consumers.To him, some evidence indeed suggests major horticultural crops demand more water through irrigation than eucalyptus. “The difference is limited studies on eucalyptus water use attributes under varying site conditions and perhaps strong competition with agriculture crop production thereby making unsuitable under smallholder agroforestry production domains,”  he said.With regards to arguments that a plant may take up less water but may reduce the volume of water because it is next to the river, Carsan said, “This is part of ‘myths’ associated with eucalyptus. Diversion of water heads and clearing of vegetation along waterways is perhaps a major problem contributing to the loss of water volumes than trees adjacent to waterways”.Carsan said planting wrong crop choices in water catchment areas would, needless to say, lead to imbalances in water and soil nutrient use.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE
25,FACT CHECK: Did Kenya have only 8 ICU beds before Corona?,"On August 30, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe made a claim that Kenya had only eight ICU beds when the first coronavirus case was reported.Kagwe, while addressing a virtual conference attended by President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy William Ruto, Cabinet secretaries and the Council of Governors, said after county governments had accessed Sh5 billion conditional grants from the national government, the capacity had been increased.Then being day 170 since the first case was reported on March 11, the number of cases had increased to 34,057 from 450,146 cumulative samples tested. Then we had 19,688 recoveries with 574 deaths.But is this claim by the CS true?In March, Kenyans sparked a debate on the country’s preparedness and capacity to handle the pandemic.While some Kenyans claimed that there were only 155 ICU beds and less than 100 ventilators, others claimed there were 130 beds out of which 80 per cent are routinely occupied, leaving only 26 available for previously unpredictable situations like patients with severe respiratory illnesses, such as Covid-19.PesaCheck thus did a fact-check to verify the claims.By the time the fact check was conducted, there was no readily available data on critical care services provided by hospitals registered by the Ministry of Health.Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi, whom ministry officials said was the right person to respond to the questions, did not avail the data as requested.But Kagwe, in a press briefing on March 29, stated that the country had at least 1,000 ICU beds, and had received 250 ventilators from the World Bank.PesaCheck in their research found a research article in the East African Medical Journal in 2015 on 21 leading healthcare centres in the country, which included referral, mission, private and level 5 hospitals.The study looked at the availability and serviceability of ICU equipment, availability of essential drugs and diagnostic support services used in the care of critically ill patients, and found it to be > 95% in private and mission hospitals, and 60–80% in the other hospitals.This means that at any one point, nine out of 10 ICU beds are available at private and mission hospitals, and six to eight beds out of 10 in the other hospitals.The report showed Kenya had 130 ICU beds in 2015, and a number of hospitals have increased their critical care capacity in the five years since the study was published, as well as new medical facilities being opened.Therefore, the claim by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe that Kenya had only eight ICU beds is misleading.To support the idea of 130 beds, a Google spreadsheet posted on Twitter on March 30 indicated the number of ICU beds and ventilators available at each private hospital.In total, the document claimed there were 314 ICU beds and 259 ventilators in private healthcare facilities.Though the user did not respond when asked to name the source, PesaCheck reached out to Karen Hospital, St Luke Hospital, Aga Khan Hospital and St Francis Hospital, which were on the list and their tally of ICU beds and ventilators matched what was on the document.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",MISLEADING
26,FACT CHECK: Expressway photo is not of Kenyan road,"A photo that has been circulating on Twitter claiming to be an express highway in Kenya is false.The photo was last week posted by advocate of the High Court and member of the Law Society of Kenya Majimbo Georgiadis claiming it was an expressway in Kakamega, completed under the leadership of Governor Wycliffe Oparanya.The photo was also tweeted by Kenya Traffic indicating it would be the model of the Gitaru Wangige bypass to Ndenderu Junction once complete.But the Star’s fact-check desk found otherwise.In the first instance, it is obvious that you keep left unless overtaking on Kenyan roads. Looking at the picture, it is seen that the oncoming traffic is coming from the left as opposed to the right.Secondly, looking at the landscape, Kakamega county or Gitaru area does not have such a landscape, a fact supported by the vegetation along the road.Thirdly, on Kenyan highways, signage is always placed on the left of the highway for the warning signs and above for the informative signs. In this photo, the signage is placed on the right.Using Google search tools, we established the road is a Polish expressway in Bielsko-Biała.The 38.2km Expressway S52 is under construction in Poland, which is located in the Silesian and Lesser Poland voivodeships. Upon completion, it will connect the border of the Czech Republic in Cieszyn-Boguszowice along with the Expressway R48 in the Czech Republic with Kraków.  The photo has, however, been used widely on reporting on the construction of the $751.2 million transnational highway between Kenya and Tanzania.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FACT CHECK
27,False: Robbery incident in lift did not happen at Sarit Centre,"A video clip circulating on social media alleging a robbery incident at Westland’s Sarit Centre is false.The Star’s fact-check desk has established that the incident happened in New York and not in Kenya.The clip had widely been circulated on WhatsApp groups with people being warned to take precautions while shopping. “This happened to one of our colleagues at Sarit Centre Nairobi,” read one of the messages attached on the clip.But looking at the clip keenly, the power adapters in the lift are round as opposed to the traditional square ones popular in Kenya.Secondly, the elevator/lift doors in Kenya are not designed to close in the manner shown in the clip. Most lifts do not have an inside door, just the lift doors that close and open.Thirdly, lift walls at Sarit Centre are white as opposed to blue.Using the Google search tools, we established the clip had been posted on an online channel indicating the incident had happened in New York over a week ago.The exact location is not, however, indicated in this link https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=sXU40_1598455896This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FACT-CHECK
28,Ex-VP Moody Awori lands role in Inter-County Covid-19 Committee,"It is true that former Vice President Moody Awori has landed a role in the Inter-County Covid-19 Committee.Awori is among a 21- member team picked to spearhead resource mobilisation for Covid-19 response in the Lake Region.Blogger  Robert Alai, had on his Twitter posted that Awori, 92, had been picked among the team which will be part of a new fundraising approach being taken by 14 counties under the Lake Region Economic Bloc – LREB in the fight against coronavirus.   The tweet generated a debate among his followers, with some questioning why Awori at his age would be picked for such a role.Another user wondered if Covid-19 had existed in Kenya before if the former VP was picked on the basis of experience.The Star’s fact-check desk moved in to establish the claim. We established that it was true Awori, well known as Uncle Moody, had been picked following a meeting held between several governors under the LREB.Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who doubles up as the LREB and the Council of Governors Chairman said together with his Kisumu counterpart Anyang Nyongó and Vihiga’s Wilberforce Otichilo had a meeting and picked the team on August 19.The meeting happened at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Sports Ground where the team was later announced.Oparanya said the team referred to as the LREB Covid-19 Resource Mobilisation and Advisory Committee will be in charge of mobilisation and monitoring of funds in the Covid-19 fight.  LREB comprises Kakamega, Kisumu, Bungoma, Vihiga, Homa Bay, Busia, Bomet, Siaya, Nyamira, Migori and Kisii counties.The 21-member LREB Covid-19 resource mobilisation team comprises of prominent philanthropists, industrialists and professionals.Among them is Esther Akoth, popularly known as Akothee, Sports personality Eliud Kipchoge,  Sanjay Patel, Prof. Khama Rogo and Catherine Mumma.Others are Rev. David Chuchu, Bath Ragalo, Jayesh Patel, Dr. Paul Mitei and FCPA Edward Ouko.According to Oparanya, the team will work under Covid-19 protocols as they aim to achieve their targets.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FACT-CHECK
29,FALSE: US Senator Kamala Harris has no Kenyan roots,"Reports circulating on social media alleging that California Senator Kamala Harris has Kenyan roots are false.The reports widely shared in WhatsApp forums and Twitter indicated that Senator Harris is a Kenyan descendant with Luhya origin.While some argued her parents come from Kakamega County, others said originally her parents hailed from Busia’s Butula area.   The debate was sparked after Joe Biden, who is the Presidential Candidate for the Democratic party named Kamala as his running mate ahead of the US election slated for November.“A Kenyan descendant makes a second sojourn at White House after Obama. She last visited Kenya in 2010 during the last push for our new constitution. Her mother Lusabeti, read Elizabeth Naliaka, comes from Kingandole village, in Bukhalalire,” read a series of conversations in a WhatsApp forum. Another Twitter user claimed that Kamala is a Bukusu whose name was Americanised from the original Khamala meaning the ‘finisher’.The Star’s fact-check desk moved in to provide clarity on the misinformation.Harris is an American politician and lawyer serving as the junior United States senator from California since 2017. The 55-year-old is a member of the Democratic Party.She is the first African American and the first Asian American to be chosen as the running mate of a major party's presidential candidate. Harris was born and raised in Oakland, California where her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a breast-cancer scientist who had emigrated from Tamil Nadu, India in 1960 to pursue a doctorate in endocrinology at UC Berkeley.Her father, Donald Harris, is a Stanford University emeritus professor of economics, who emigrated from British Jamaica in 1961 for graduate study in economics at UC BerkeleyLike Barack Obama, a mixed-race heritage has allowed Harris to connect across identities and reach multiple audiences and voting blocs.She ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 election, briefly becoming a front runner before ending her campaign on December 3, 2019, citing a lack of funds to continue.Her nomination as the running mate thus makes her the third female US vice presidential nominee of a major party, after Geraldine Ferraro and Sarah Palin.",FACT-CHECK
30,FACT CHECK: Viral photo purporting Cuban doctor married Busia man is false,"The photo that has been circulating on social media purporting that one of the Cuban doctors had married a Busia man is false.The viral photo on Facebook and WhatsApp groups claimed that the doctor, 63, identified as Manuela had married her 22- year-old boyfriend after they met at the Kakamega Referral Hospital.It was published on Facebook by Flame TV Kenya, an online news outlet. Several other outlets picked the article and ran stories with amplified voices on why a young man would end up marrying an older woman.The Star’s fact-check desk investigated this claim and established that no such incident had happened.We made an inquiry at the Busia County Government to find out if they had been informed about the alleged marriage.Although marriage is a social affair and concerned parties choose on who to invite and not, working under the county government, at least a senior official at the county would have been informed.Chief Officer Health Isaac Omeri confirmed there was no such marriage that had taken place.In the description of the photo, the venue where the marriage happened was not indicated but the background indicates the couple might have been at a beech.Secondly, we looked at the details of the four doctors deployed in Kakamega and Busia counties to establish whether one among them was identified as Manuela as claimed in the photo. The Star established that while Busia county received two doctors; a family doctor and a nephrologist - David Rodrigues and Sorangel Taylor, Kakamega received family physician Alba Gercia, who specialises in comprehensive health care, and intensivist Milver Gomez - a specialist in critical care.Evidently none of them is called Manuela.We dug deep to establish where the photos had originated from. Using Google search tools, we established the photos were originally published by online entertainment publications in Ghana.“A young Ghanaian man has caused a stir on social media as he has found the love of his life. This young man trended on social media as photos from his low-key wedding with his old white lady surfaced online,” read one of the articles.We further established that these online publications, including Opera News, picked the article after it was originally posted on Instagram by renowned broadcaster Abeiku Santana.According to Santana, the young man by the name Nii and his wife got married at La Pleasure Beach in Ghana on June 25 and has nothing to do with Kenya as alleged.The beach also known as Labadi Beach is the busiest beach on Ghana's coast.It is one of Accra's beaches and is maintained by the local hotels in a town called La, popularly known as Labadi, near Teshie in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana.",FALSE

From the nations mentioned in the claim, only Rwanda made it to the initial list.China has also been included in the provisional list, but its citizens’ entry into Europe depends on if Chinese authorities will allow EU citizens to visit the country. Reciprocity is a condition of being on the list.The statement says non-essential travel restrictions for the 14 countries will be lifted effective July 1, “with this list being reviewed and, as the case may be, updated every two weeks”.According to the commission, the plan to select the countries was drawn up based on health criteria, including recording a decrease in the number of new infections over the last 14 days.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that the EU has banned Kenyans from entering Europe due to the COVID-19 pandemic and allowed citizens of four other African countries to visit and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.By partnering with Facebook and similar social media platforms, third-party fact-checking organisations like PesaCheck are helping to sort fact from fiction.

32,FACT CHECKER: Atwoli has not been appointed to head Kenya’s electoral body,"A Facebook post claiming that Francis Atwoli, the head of Kenya’s Central Organization of Trade Unions, has been appointed the Chief Executive Officer of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is FALSE.The post states that Mr Atwoli had been appointed to replace Ezra Chiloba at the IEBC. Mr Chiloba was fired in 2018.However, the IEBC has not made any announcement on Mr Atwoli’s appointment on the commission’s website, Facebook, and Twitter accounts. IEBC communications manager Edgar Aswani also confirmed to PesaCheck that the claim is not true.“The matter of the appointment of the IEBC CEO is still in court and as you are aware, courts are still not fully operational. Therefore, once and if the matter is concluded, it will be a matter of public knowledge and we shall also communicate the same. The commission’s acting CEO is Marjan Hussein Marjan,” Mr Aswani said.On May 21, 2019, IEBC advertised the position of the commission secretary and CEO and received 95 applications.“Mr Atwoli was not one of the shortlisted candidates, and even if he was, the matter awaits the court to give direction,” Mr Aswani said.The communications manager also clarified that the appointment of the CEO follows a clear recruitment process, where the position is advertised in the local dailies and the commission’s website. This is followed by the shortlisting of candidates who have applied for the position and meet the requirements. The commission then interviews prospective candidates and through this final stage selects the person best suited for the post.This is not the first time that a false post has claimed that Mr Atwoli has been appointed to the IEBC. On May 12, another post claimed that he had replaced Wafula Chebukati, who had purportedly resigned as the chairman.However, Capital FM shared a similar claim in the form of a screenshot of an SMS news alert which included a link to the news organisation’s website and denounced it as fake.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Francis Atwoli has been appointed CEO of the IEBC, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",
33,"Bellevue, GM footbridges to be demolished for JKIA-Westlands Expressway","It is true that the existing footbridges at the General Motors and Bellevue will be demolished to pave way for the new JKIA-Westlands Expressway.The Star’s fact-check desk moved in to verify claims that demolition of the two bridges which are a true representation of pedestrian safety would risk more lives on the busy highway.Journalist James Smart on his Twitter account indicated that it was ironic that the government spent millions of taxpayers money on the two bridges only for them to be demolished.The tweet generated mixed reactions among his followers, with others questioning if the government had a master-plan for the expressway.The Star contacted the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) to ascertain the truth.Director General Eng Peter Mundinia confirmed that the existing bridges at GM will be dismantled and new pedestrian bridges erected in their place as part of the Nairobi Expressway works.However, he said the South C Footbridge will be maintained as is.The cost of the two bridges, according to Mundinia, is Sh362 million with Bellevue bridge connecting South C costs Sh177 million. The one at General Motors cost Sh185 million.He said the superstructure of the existing bridges was constructed using structural steel members which can be recovered and reassembled at the same or different location.The two footbridges were built by H. Young & Company though EACC raised concerns over the tendering process. The Kenya Roads Board (KRB) financed the construction work using money from the road maintenance fuel levy fund.The JKIA–Westlands Highway is a planned toll road connecting Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to the neighborhood of Rironi, in Kiambu County, along the Nairobi-Limuru Road.The road starts at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, along the Nairobi-Mombasa Road and continues along the existing roadway to the Likoni Road Junction, a distance of approximately 12 kilometres.From the Likoni Road junction, the toll highway continues northwards to the James Gichuru Road junction, a distance of approximately 12.5 kilometres.From there, the road continues for about 25 kilometres to Rironi, along the Nairobi–Nakuru Road, where the toll highway ends.The total length of the toll highway is about 50 kilometres.Kenya contracted China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) to build this toll road on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis.CRBC will use their own money to construct the road expansion, interchanges and toll stations after which they will collect the toll fees until their investment is recovered, then the road will be reverted to the government.The cost of the toll highway is quoted as between Sh51 billion and Sh65 billion with works being done in stages.The 50-km road aims at easing traffic from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport heading into the Nairobi city centre.The work involves expansion of the existing road to four-lanes one-way, (8 lanes total), with footpaths, drainage channels, overpass bridges and street lighting.This fact-check was produced by the Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle AkademieMore:",FACT CHECK
34,Kenya has released 600 Covid-19 patients from hospital into home-based care,"An article published in The Star claiming that 600 COVID-19 patients have been released from hospital and will take part in a home-based care programme being piloted by the Ministry of Health is TRUEHealth Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe announced that the ministry had developed guidelines and protocols for the implementation of a home and community-based isolation and treatment programme, which would allow asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to leave hospital.The guidelines, released on June 21, advise that patients should not share space with others, and should be in an environment where access to food is guaranteed, personal protective equipment is available. The guidelines also advise that patients be released only when there are no household members who may be at increased risk of complications from COVID-19 infections.Mr Kagwe said the 600 patients — 338 from Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital and 212 from Coast General Hospital — would be the first cases released to this programme. The programme is scheduled to be extended to patients from medical facilities across the country, the CS said.The adoption of home-based care is aimed at relieving pressure on the country’s medical system as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise exponentially.Additionally, Kenya is adopting a community-based approach as a preventive measure against the spread of COVID-19. This involves collaborating with non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders to achieve behaviour change and reduce the number of infected people needing health care at any given time.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that the Ministry of Health has released 600 COVID-19 patients to pilot the home-based care programme, and finds it is TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",
35,MISLEADING: Kakamega residents did not hold pro-Ruto demos,"Last week a photo was widely shared purportedly showing how Kakamega residents took to the streets in support of Deputy President William Ruto.In a photo shared on social media networks, the 'locals' are seen sitting in the road while lifting their hands during the 'demo'.A message attached on the photo read,But did this happen?, the Star moved swiftly to establish the authenticity of the claim.Where did it start?The photo with the caption was widely circulated on WhatsApp indicating that Kakamega residents had decided to welcome DP Ruto as their preferred leader.This post was made at a time when there is currently a lot of political re-alignments, especially within the major political parties as well as the Western region.Kakamega for years has been one of the stronghold areas for the opposition outfit whose Governor Wycliffe Oparanya swept to power on an ODM ticket.The Star called Shinyalu OCPD Robert Maku to confirm the claims.The police boss confirmed the alleged incident did not take place on the airstrip. According to Makau, Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa was destined to Budalangi where they were to flag off a relief food distribution exercise.But a crowd of boda boda operators and some youth started shouting at the CS's entourage chanting that they knew Ruto, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula.The post thus implied that residents had decided to shift their allegiance to Ruto and his wing of the Jubilee Party.FINDINGS The Star established that the said photo was not taken in Kakamega as alleged. The photo was in fact taken in 2016 outside the Anniversary Towers in Nairobi where protesters had camped during the famous anti-IEBC demos.The photo was originally used on an online story by the Daily Mail on June 6, 2016.Whereas it is true that Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa accompanied by the governor flagged off trucks containing relief food, the Cotu Secretary General was not part of the delegation and the food was from the national government under the Covid-19 kitty.According to teams on the ground, the event took place at the Kakamega Airstrip in Shinyalu. There was no problem when governor Oparanya and CS Wamalwa arrived for the event.Residents had gathered at the venue to witness the flagging off. When the CS was done, the residents hoped that he alongside other leaders addressed them.A few days earlier, the leaders were part of a 'Luhya Unity meeting at Atwoli’s residence.The meeting had brought a lot of jitters in the Western region and the residents knew it was an opportune time to be informed of what that particular meeting was about.They were however disappointed when the CS, governor and other leaders entered in their cars and sped off saying they were to attend to other matters.This did not go well with some of the youth who had come for the event. At this point, they started chanting ‘tunataka Ruto’ (we want Ruto).This incident was captured and used on an online story by the Standard Digital.A day later, former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale was arrested for allegedly inciting the youth in the chants.Khalwale presented himself to Malinya police station after warrants of arrest were issued against him and deposited a Sh100,000 police bail to secure his release.He was later released after the DPP withdrew the incitement charges against him.More:",FACT CHECK

I have finally made my decision to support the incoming 5th President of the Republic of Kenya H.E William Ruto. The hustler’s nation is indeed unstoppable”.Within hours, the tweet had been retweeted more than 340 times with over 1.6K likes.The Star investigated the account and established that it was created in January 2020 with 12.5k followers.FINDINGS.The Senator’s official Twitter account has a following of 198.3K and he follows 3,050 people.On this account, the senator joined twitter in April 2014 as opposed to Jan 2020.  We reached out to the Senator who admitted to have seen the tweet.""I have seen it and it is a fake tweet. The person who did this used a small 'L'. It is the work of my detractors,"" Ledama said.The last tweet by the senator was 19 hours where he commended ODM leader Raila Odinga for welcoming Hon Sarah Lekorer.“We are focused on the unity of the Maa Nation. We thank Raila Odinga for welcoming Hon. Sarah Lekorer back home,” his tweet read.Olekina was elected on an Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) ticket in the August 8, 2017, general elections.The Senator had been at cross-roads with the party leadership after he was de-whipped from the committees following his election as the chairman of the influential CPAIC.The senator reportedly went against the party position which had preserved the seat for Kisii Senator Sam Ongeri.He teamed up with a section of senators in the committee to win the chairmanship of the committee.The move rattled the ODM party with Minority Leader James Orengo protesting the manner in which the election was held.“I express and register dissatisfaction with the conduct and outcome of the election of the leadership of the County Public Accounts and Investments Committee, which were purportedly done,"" Orengo said.“We intend to withdraw our membership from the said committee until an appropriate resolution can be made.""But Olekina protested the ouster and went to court to get his set back.“Some people don’t want me to chair this committee but I want to say that I have been democratically elected and will serve my country in this position,” Ole Kina had told the Star.The high court has temporarily barred the Speaker of the Senate from removing Senator Ledama Olekina from the position of Chairperson County Public Accounts and Investments Committee.In the case, Ledama through lawyer Nelson Havi, argued that he had been validly elected as a member of the Minority Party in the Senate and without notice to him as required by standing orders.However, after a meeting with party leader Raila Odinga, the decision to strike him from the committee was reversed.The two met at the former prime minister's home in Karen alongside a group of elders from the Maa community.In the deal, the vocal senator agreed to withdraw the case he filed against the party after he was removed from the chairmanship of the County Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC).“Senator @ledamalekina has this morning agreed to withdraw the case he filed against @theODM  party over the senate public accounts committee chairmanship, surrendered the seat and apologised,” Raila tweeted. “In return, I have instructed the party to reverse the decision to de-whip the senator.”",FAKE ACCOUNT

The amount was to be deposited through an M-Pesa account or a bank account at the NCBA.FINDINGSThe Star has established that the foundation does not have any offices in Nairobi as indicated in the advert.The foundation has regional offices based in Washington DC, UK, India and China.With regards to the African continent, the foundation has its main Africa office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia focusing to improve health and help smallholder farmers lift themselves out of poverty.The Africa office has representatives based in Johannesburg, South Africa and Abuja, Nigeria who oversee its initiatives in those countries and evidently Kenya is not one of them.This is backed by the fact that the foundation responded saying it was aware of a potential scam involving a foundation office in Nairobi, Kenya.“Please know that we do not have any office in Nairobi, Kenya, and ask that you report any fraudulent activity to local authorities in Kenya,” the foundation said.Secondly, the advert had indicated that a fee of Sh4,100 would be charged on every category, but the foundation confirmed that it does not ask for any administrative fees for awarding a grant.The foundation does not host internet lotteries or offer prizes of any kind through email, postal mail, telephone, fax, or in person, Request registration fees for conferences or summits or Request information about bank accounts or other private information,” part of the statement read in part.This is in contrary to what the advert indicated.  Potential firms and companies were asked to submit tender reference numbers, company names, addresses and phone numbers.The Name of the contact person, mobile money transaction reference number were also among details asked for.But the foundation said it does not approach individuals in person offering grant opportunities, solicit donations at any time or offer investment opportunities.",FALSE
38,A team of medical doctor trainees from JKUAT has not produced a vaccine for coronavirus,"A blog post shared on Facebook claiming that medics at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology have developed a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, and that six Chinese victims of the disease had been cured with this vaccine is FALSE.According to the post, a 7-member medical student team from JKUAT had completed work on the vaccine ‘last week’ and shipped samples to China ‘over the weekend’, with those who received the treatment showing rapid signs of recovery.There is no date of publication on the article, making it difficult to determine what the dates are.However, this story has not appeared in any other news outlets, and it contains a number of inconsistencies.Viral diseases, such as those caused by the coronavirus family, require an individual to be inoculated before infection for them to be effective, and not after infection.Additionally, the article does not indicate key details, such as which university the students were at for the exchange program, and when and where exactly the vaccines were administered.There is no Professor Moses Yumbya listed on staff at the JKUAT School of Health, or anywhere else on the university website.The article also claims that the JKUAT team was expected to head to China to assist in mass production of the vaccine to help fight the virus, but Kenya Airways and a number of other airlines have suspended flights to the area.There is no information about students on an exchange program to China on the JKUAT website, and the university also negated this claim when called for comment on this article.Dr. Rollins Makokha, a Surgery resident at Kenyatta National Hospital, told PesaCheck that it is not possible to develop a vaccine and conduct human trials within a month. According to Dr Makokha, the first process would be to recreate the virus in a lab and then study it to determine the type of antibodies that the immune system would produce in response to it.The vaccines would then be subjected to animal testing, and once the safety and efficacy is established, the vaccines can advance into clinical trials in humans. If they pass the process and are deemed safe for humans they can then be mass produced for vaccination.ABC News Australia reported on 29 January that Australian scientists had succeeded in growing the 2019-nCoV virus in a lab, which is the first step in the vaccine development process. The scientists are aiming to meet a 16-week deadline to test the coronavirus vaccine on humans.In the meantime, the World Health Organisation called for continued collaboration on studies into the severity and transmissibility of the virus in order to advance scientific understanding of the virus and contribute to the development of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and treatments.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that medics at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology have developed a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, and that six Chinese victims of the disease had been cured with this vaccine and finds it to be FALSE.This fact-check was written by PesaCheck Managing Editor Eric Mugendi, with research input from Sylvia Makinia.",

40,Trump didn't say that disinfectant injection test to counter virus will start in Africa,"The assertion conveyed by this Facebook publication which says that the American president Donald Trump announced that tests of injection of disinfectant to fight against the new coronavirus will begin in Africa, is disputed.
The post, illustrated with a photo of Donald Trump, quotes the President saying that the disinfectant has been analyzed and found to be an effective remedy for coronavirus.
He adds that Trump has said that the disinfectant injection test will start in Africa.
Curiously, one might wonder why a remedy declared to be effective still needs to be tested. Hence, a contradiction in the post.The source of the information is not mentioned in the publication, and neither Donald Trump's personal Twitter account , nor the official account of the Presidency of the United States of America, show any trace of the statement.
In addition, President Trump makes daily press briefings at the White House.
It was also during one of these daily press briefings that, on April 23, 2020, the applicant had suggested that Covid-19 patients receive injections of disinfectant in the lungs to cure the disease.
A speech which did not fail to indignant the entourage of the president as well as the international community.
 And faced with the surge of acerbic reactions that triggered it, Donald Trump quickly tried to catch up the next day, assuring that he was ""sarcastic"".
In addition, an analysis of the author's account of the publication reveals that the credibility of said account is ambiguous.

 

Indeed, PesaCheck had already discredited one of its publications according to which, Professor Didier Raoult would have revealed plans of sabotage of COVID-Organics, remedy developed in Madagascar, by the World Health Organization (WHO) and France.
Compared to the remedies and vaccines against Covid-19, the WHO affirms that until now, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drug against the disease today.

41,"FACT CHECKER: No, smoking bhang doesn't prevent Covid-19","A video shared on Facebook claiming that smoking cannabis can prevent COVID-19 is FALSE.
According to the video, non-smokers are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than regular smokers of cannabis, and the abundance of the drug in Jamaica is apparently the reason why there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country.
However, while studies have shown that cannabis has medicinal properties, and a cannabis-based drug has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, there is no evidence to suggest it can be used to prevent COVID-19.
In fact, when the video was published on March 31, 2020, Jamaica had already confirmed 38 cases of COVID-19, indicating that smoking cannabis does not provide immunity against the disease.
The World Health Organization identifies people with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease, are the ones more vulnerable to COVID- 19, rather than those who don’t smoke cannabis as claimed.
Further, smoking cannabis can damage the lungs according to the American Lung Association, and can cause chronic bronchitis, which results from damage to the cells that line the airways. Lung damage from smoking has been cited by the World Health Organization as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and could contribute to serious symptoms and death among patients that have underlying cardiovascular diseases
The five measures that the World Health Organization recommends to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are washing hands regularly for 20 seconds with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub, not touching one’s eyes, nose and mouth, covering one’s nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing, social distancing by avoiding close contact with people who are unwell and staying home and self-isolating from others if unwell.

42,There is currently no evidence that pregnancy puts women at greater risk of getting COVID-19,"A Facebook post claiming that pregnant mothers are more likely to contract COVID-19 is FALSE.
Responding to comments on his own post, the author says he got the information from KTN News, a television news bulletin broadcast by Nairobi-based Standard Media Group. He makes no mention of the research it is based on or the organisation that conducted it.Pesacheck got in touch with KTN News, who confirmed that they published a story by Reuters, on their print publication, The Standard. The story, however, shines a spotlight on the plight of expectant women in malaria-prone areas during the COVID-19 pandemic given that pesticide spraying to kill mosquitoes has been suspended due to lockdowns.
According to the article, a combination of these factors is what puts them at a higher risk of contracting both malaria, COVID-19 or even vulnerable to misdiagnoses as the two diseases carry similar symptoms, rather than the mere fact that they are pregnant as claimed.
Although pregnancy does cause changes in the body and immune system, making expectant mothers more susceptible to some respiratory infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) says there is currently no evidence that they are more prone to COVID-19 than the general population.
WHO adds that research is still underway to understand the full impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women, but in the meantime, urges them to take the same precautions to avoid the virus as other people.
These include washing hands with soap or sanitising with an alcohol-based rub, maintaining social distancing, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth, and seeking medical attention early if one has a fever, cough or difficulty in breathing.
There is also no evidence that COVID-19 can be passed from an expectant mother to her child either during pregnancy, at the time of delivery, or through breastfeeding.

43,Sonko's video doesn't show bodies of virus victims dumped into the sea,"A Facebook post with a video shared by the governor of Nairobi, Mike Sonko, claiming to show bodies of Covid-19 victims dumped into the sea is FALSE.
The post reads “some countries throw Covid-19 infected dead bodies into the seas.”
The video is being shared amid reports that governments across the world are facing challenges in managing a steep rise in the number of dead bodies they must handle due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Hundreds of unclaimed bodies were recently buried in a mass grave in New York.
With more than 600,000 cases and over 30,000 deaths as of April 16, the United States has experienced a surge in coronavirus infections and deaths in the past month.
An examination of the video using the InVID video verification tool shows that the clip is linked to a post dating back to 2018, long before the outbreak of Covid-19.A Google search links the video to African immigrants who died in a ship accident off the Libyan coast in 2014 while trying to get to Europe.
Media reports indicate that the bodies were found washed up 30 miles east of Tripoli, the capital of Libya.
A 2014 report of the same incident carried in the UK’s Daily Mail shows photographs of the rescue and recovery operation in Libya.
Data analysed by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees shows that many African migrants die in their attempt to cross the Mediterranean sea to get to Europe every year.
In July 2019, up to 150 immigrants were reported dead off the Libyan coast while 137 others were rescued when a boat they were travelling in capsized.

45,Is Wuhan exporting clothes and beddings to Africa?,"The mention of the word Wuhan easily brings the current coronavirus pandemic in mind.
Wuhan, the capital of Central China’s Hubei province, is a commercial centre divided by the Yangtze and Han rivers. 
It is here that the outbreak was first identified in December 2019 before it was  recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.
As at March 24, more than 395,807 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in more than 196 countries and territories, resulting in more than 17,235 deaths and  103,748 recoveries.
On Tuesday a twitter user made a claim that China authorities had allowed Wuhan to import used clothes and beddings to Africa,
Is this true?
The Star's fact-check desk moved in to establish the truth,
The claim
Clothes, beddings etc from Wuhan China are set to flood the second-hand market's in Africa

 

The twitter user by the name Masibili made the claim that second-hand clothes and beddings from Wuhan were set to flood the markets in Africa.
Though he did not name any specific country, Masibili said the move was a clear indication that the coronavirus ain't disappearing any time soonFINDINGS
Coronavirus is a pandemic disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
Well known as Covid-19, the virus is typically spread from one person to another via respiratory droplets produced during coughing or sneezing.
It primarily spreads when people are in close contact but may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface and then one's face.
The World Health Organisation says the disease is most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear.
The time between exposure and symptoms onset is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
While common symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
There is currently no vaccine for the disease but recommended preventive measures include handwashing, covering mouth when coughing, social distancing and self-isolation among others.
We searched for the image used on Masibili's post and established that the photo was published on Chinese Website in Jan 2015.It was later reshared 33 times within China Mainland, Taiwan 14 times and South Korea 2 times.
Other areas that the photo has been shared include the USA, Thailand, Algeria, Cameroon and Spain with a total of 83 results.
We called the Chinese Embassy to confirm this claim and the spokesperson Ms Xueqing Huang dismissed it as mere propaganda.
Huang said Wuhan has been on a total lock down and all travel was banned until April 8.
VERDICT: FALSE
The Star's fact-check terms this post as false since there is no airline that is operating outside Wuhan.
Chinese authorities said Tuesday they will end a two-month lock down of most of coronavirus-hit Hubei province at midnight, as domestic cases of what has become a global pandemic subsides.
China barred people from leaving or entering Wuhan beginning January 23 in a surprise middle-of-the-night announcement and expanded that to most of the province in the consecutive days.
Trains and flights were cancelled and checkpoints set up on roads into the central province.
The outbreak has since been brought under control, and Hubei has seen almost no new infections for more than a week.More:",COVID-19 FACT CHECK
46,Are Africans immune to corona virus?,"Over the past few weeks, there has been a rumour that Africans are immune to the current corona virus disease.
This narrative has been widely shared on social media after it emerged that an African man had been treated and cured of the disease.
Despite numerous fact-checks that have been published, the narrative has still been circulated widely, on the grounds that Africa has reported low cases amid alerts on high risk of infection.
But is it true that Africans are immune?
Claim: Africans are immune to coronavirus
This claim was shared on a Facebook post several days after the outbreak of the disease in China’s Wuhan district.
The post claimed that a man had been cured because he had a ‘black skin’.
The Star’s fact-check team has been following since then and established to date there is no scientific evidence to link the cure to the race of the man.The desk established that Senou a Cameroonian student studying at China’s Yangtze University was admitted to hospital in early February and was successfully treated.
This was confirmed by the Chinese Embassy on Twitter.
An article was then published at news.af.feednews.com implying that Senu had been cured because he was black.
According to the article, the Chinese doctors confirmed that Senou stayed alive because of his blood genetic composition which is mainly found in the genetic composition of Subsaharan Africans.
The article indicated that Chinese doctors said Senou remained alive because he has black skin, the antibodies of a black are 3 times stronger, powerful and resistant compare to that of white.This article was then shared on Facebook in South Africa and by the following day, it had received over 2,000 shares.
Since then, the post has been widely shared in Kenya and Nigeria.
Days later, france24.com publication ran an article claiming health experts had been puzzled with Africa’s low rate of infection.
FINDINGS
As governments across the world grapple with the Coronavirus outbreak, WHO has reiterated the need to enhance surveillance and response activities and share critical information, as being essential to containing the outbreak and strengthening health systems.
 Globally, 90,870 cases have been confirmed out of which 1,922 were new cases as of March 3.
 China has the highest number of cases at 80,304 with the death toll standing at 2,946. Out of these deaths, 31 had been reported as new since the outbreak in Wuhan.
 Outside China, WHO data shows 10,566 cases have been confirmed in 72 countries.
A total of 166 deaths have been reported.The risk of infection both in China and globally is very high.
 The African continent is estimated to have a population of about 1.3 billion.
 The continent has close commercial links with China and there have been fears that the virus would spread due to the fragility of its medical services.
 Africa has only reported 12 cases as of March 4, with Algeria having the highest number of cases at five.
 Other countries with patients who tested positive for the virus are;

Egypt - two people
Senegal – two people
Morocco - one person
Nigeria - one person
Tunisia - one person

Kenya which was perceived as a hot spot due to its close ties with Beijing has had over 15 alerts but all tested negative.
 Out of all the cases, African Union data shows, they are imported cases by foreign nationals either on transit or visiting the said countries.Coronavirus is a small micro-organism that cannot be seen by the naked eye but through specialised equipment.
 Epidemiologist Abdhalah Ziraba said the virus can survive in animal bodies but has the ability to survive on surfaces for at least 7 days.
 The virus is described as a circular object with sparks that look like a crown, which is where it derives its name.
Ziraba said the virus is a close relative to those that cause the common cold that we get all the time.
“While other flu’s are characterised by mild symptoms like headache, fever, sneezing and coughing, corona has a severe lung infection which is a sign of pneumonia,” he said.
Ziraba said the accumulation of water in the lungs denies them oxygen hence causing failure to breathe and ultimately death in some instances.According to the expert, many of those who are infected don’t get severe symptoms and can recover with timely intervention. He puts between 1-3 the number of complicated cases out of 100 infections.The complicated cases are attributed to pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes that compromise the immune system.The disease coded as COVID-19 originated from China in a food market said to be selling animals.Genetic diversity in Africa Omolade Awodu, a professor of haematology at the school of medicine at the Nigeria’s University of Benin, told Africa Check this is a  new virus and very little is known about it.She said in the decades of research she has not come across any research that confirms the claim that African blood composition or black skin resist coronavirus.
VERDICT – UNPROVEN
The Star is certain that the perception that Africans are immune to the disease is unproven.
According to Ziraba, there is no clinical study to back the claims that Africans have natural immunity.
He said the low cases in Africa could be a result of under-reporting or misdiagnosis, a theory that is backed by Africa’s weak health system.
“Although the disease is a viral infection, there is no evidence to link the disease to the difference in race,” he said. 
 He said though not yet confirmed, the disease might be thriving in cold weather, and by the fact that both the southern and northern hemispheres are experiencing winter, it would explain why those areas are more affected.These sentiments are echoed by the research arm of the doctors without borders MSF who said Coronaviruses, which include some of the viruses responsible for the common cold and flu, can show something called seasonality — that is, they peak and wane depending on the season.
In an interview with DW the doctors said many cold and flu viruses peak in winter, for example; the droplets sneezed and coughed out by people spread more easily in winter's cold dry air and when people are crowded inside together.
They then die down in warmer weather.""When the season is warmer and more humid, the droplets transmitting the [flu virus] tend to fall out of the air more quickly, therefore limiting its transmission,"" explained Yap Boum.Professor Amadou Alpha Sall, director of the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal told AFP that, “Ethnicity and genetics have no influence on recovery from the virus, and black people don’t have more antibodies than white people.To him, there is lots of false information about the disease and this was an example.",CORONAVIRUS
47,FACT CHECK: Has KWS banned conservationist Paula Kahumbu from Kenyan parks?,"A wildlife conservationist Paula Kahumbu has claimed that she was banned from entering Nairobi National Park.
But are these claims true?
The Star fact-check desk moved in to ascertain the authenticity of her claims.

 


 

On her social media pages, Kahumbu claimed that she was banned after her spirited campaign against KWS for having allowed the recent Koroga Festival to be held inside a protected area, the Hells Gate National Park.""I have been waiting at the entrance of Nairobi Park for one hour - they will not sell me a ticket because, they say, there are issues to be sorted. No mention of what issues or with whom,"" she said.
This attracted various responses from her social media followers who sided with her side of the story.Where it started 
Last week, a Nakuru court ruled against WildlifeDirect’s application for an injunction as well as a petition against KWS and the Naivasha Love Festival over the Koroga Festival.

 


 

In the ruling, Justice Mutungi stated that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.
This led to conservationists say the ruling was a  great loss and injustice to wildlife and protected areas in Kenya.

 

Kahumbu, who is the Chief Executive Officer at WildlifeDirect after losing the case said, “Success is not winning a court case. Success is a thriving wildlife. It is a very sad day for Kenya and lovers of wildlife that the agency responsible for the conservation of wildlife has accepted Sh700,000 ($7000) despite the fact that the event imperils critically endangered species in an already degraded park.”
Later on, she went on Facebook and registered her disappointments openly.""The court threw the case out on a technicality. Because of this ruling, KWS gets away with violating the law,"" she said.
""I am disappointed, very disappointed that the judge was so supportive of the event. I want to scream, punch and kick. Am I crazy?""
What are the findings?
The Star's fact-check desk has established that whereas it is true that Kahumbu moved to court over the Koroga Festival, she has not been banned from accessing the parks.
Director-General John Waweru's PA by the name Mark Kinyua told our teams on the ground that they are trying to fix an appointment for Kahumbu. 
Kinyua, acknowledged that they had received a letter from Kahumbu about her being denied access.
""The DG has received an email from Kahumbu about the same, we will make an appointment with her and straighten out her issues."" he said.
His sentiments were supported by KWS spokesman Paul Udoto who told the Star that they have not banned the conservationist.
""Ask her to share with you the evidence that she has been banned from the parks. I am not aware of any ban,"" Udoto said.""Paula has made the claim. KWS has not publicly accused her of anything yet. The burden of proving her claims lies on her,"" he added.
On reaching out to the vocal conservationist, she said when she arrived at the park's entrance on Tuesday with some visitors, she was denied access and told to clear with the DG.
She said she tried to reach out on the DG through phone but his line was not going through forcing them to leave after several hours of waiting.
""He was not even in the building. The staff asked me to wait. After an hour they asked me to call the DG. He didn’t answer. I told my friends to go ahead. The guide is embarrassed and ashamed. What is the point of this? I called others at KWS...You are joking...is what one of the senior staff said. What kind of Kenya do we live in?"" she said.
""The press keep calling me and are asking a lot of questions. I suggest they call KWS as I can only re-state what happened. I have nothing in writing from KWS regarding why I have been barred from entering Nairobi Park,"" she added.
Verdict
Currently, there is no law that allows KWS to ban someone from accessing the park, however, only those that are deemed criminals, armed with weapons or potential poachers can be prevented from accessing the parks.
It is in the public domain that Kahumbu went to court over the cancellation of the festival.
A Nairobi Court sitting ruled that Kahumbu’s case was “baseless”, and ordered that organisers proceed with the mega-cultural entertainment event at Hells Gate National Park.
Kahumbu in her disappointment took the war to social media instead of seeking redress from an alternative court as she had been advised.
Secondly, the teams on the ground asked Kahumbu to provide any documents to back the claims that she had been banned, which she could not.
Instead, she said in the email sent to the DG, that she asked to be furnished with reasons behind the ban and formal documents for the same.
From reports gathered, the conservationist was only told for her to gain access at the entry, she needs to get a clearance from the DG.
The Star thus indicates the claims by Kahumbu are FALSE and MISLEADING  as she has not sorted out whatever pending issues she has with the DG's office.
Such claims can only stand with all indications that whatever issues that are pending are sorted and that KWS has issued proper documentation to back the same.",FALSE!
48,FACT CHECK: Did June Ruto meet Echesa in Poland as part of the fake military arms deal?,"A photo of former Sports CS Rashid Echesa with Deputy President William Ruto's daughter June Ruto has gone viral on social media alleging that the two met in Poland to negotiate part of what has come out as the fake military arms deal.
But are these claims true?
The Star fact-check desk moved in to ascertain the authenticity of the image.

 


 

How did it start?
Echesa and three others were last week arrested by DCI detectives over links to procure a fake military arms deal for the government.
The deal is said to have been worth Sh39.5 billion.
Echesa and his co-accused were on Monday charged with conspiracy to commit a felony by conspiring to make a document with intent to defraud.
Echesa has also been charged alongside three others with six counts of making a false document in the scam.
They are also alleged to have obtained Sh11.5 Million from Kozlowski Stanley Bruno by purporting that they will award him with a tender to supply military equipment.
However, they all denied the charges.Echesa has also denied impersonating to be Deputy President William Ruto's PA.
The suspects were also charged with attempting to defraud Sh39 billion from the complainants.
The prosecution opposed bail with the DPP saying if released they might interfere with witnesses and exhibits.They were however granted a Sh1 million bail or an alternative Sh3 million bond each to secure their freedom.
Kenyans On Twitter later started a hashtag condemning Echesa and the deals.
While some used the photoshop photo to demand the recalling of June, others went ahead to clarify it was a fake photo used for propaganda.
What are the findings?
The Star's fact-check desk has established that whereas it is true Echesa is being investigated for the fake arms deal, a silent campaign dubbed '2030 files' has been going on over his close links to the deputy president William Ruto.
As a result, when Echesa was arrested, his photos portraying him to be in negotiations with top Polish military personnel flooded the social media.
One aspect that is clear is that these photos were branded 2030 files.
The office of the DP on Monday clarified that at no point has the DP held a meeting with Ehesa over the deal.
Communications secretary David Mugonyi said while it is true Echesa visited the Harambee Annex with an intention to meet the DP, the meeting did not happen as the DP was absent from the office.
Sor far the DCI have reviewed the CCTV footage and grilled top aides to the DP as investigations into the deal proceed.Secondly, the Star established that Kenya does not have an Embassy in Poland.
It has an Embassy is in Rome, Italy but with multiple accreditations to Poland, Cyprus, Greece and Malta with Ambassador Jackline Yonga serving as the current permanent representative.
A source from the foreign affairs confirmed that Ruto's daughter June Ruto serves as the current deputy head of mission to Poland.
In February last year, some Kenyans took to social media after it emerged that June Ruto was Kenya’s Charge D’Affaires in Poland.
The information emerged when then Foreign Affairs CS Monica Juma posted photos with June as she received her in Warsaw where she was on a diplomatic trip.
“Arrived in Warsaw, Poland this morning to attend the Warsaw Summit which will be looking at security in the Middle East, taking place tomorrow. Was received by June Ruto, Charge D’Affaires,” Juma posted on Twitter.
When asked of June's role in the European nation, the ministry denied the claims saying, ""It is not true that she has been posted as a deputy ambassador. In fact, she is a very junior officer working as international relations and trade officer under the American directorate at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs"".June's role thus remains one of the senior-most ranks in foreign service as a Charge D’Affaires heads an embassy in the absence of the ambassador.
June holds a master’s degree in International Studies from the University of Queensland, Australia and a bachelor's degree in Diplomacy from the United States International University (USIU) in Nairobi.
The ministry told the Star that despite June's position, she has not at any point held talks with anybody regarding whatever negotiations leave alone a military deal.
On digging deeper, the Star established the viral photo is a photoshop created on Monday.
The original photo was taken in Poland last year during the 26th International Defense Industry Exhibition (MSPO).
The event attracted 624 exhibitors from 31 countries all displaying modern weaponry in terms of bombs, tanks and drones.
The said photo is thus among 22 pictures that were displayed in the gallery as in the link below.Verdict
It is in public that Echesa and three others are being investigated for the fake deal.
So far police reports indicate they had already obtained Sh11.5 million from Kozlowski Stanley Bruno for the deal.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is confirmed that June Ruto is the deputy head of mission to Poland.
However, the claims that Echesa and Ruto held a meeting to negotiate the deal are baseless because the image is Photoshopped.
The Star thus indicates the claims are FALSE as police are yet to conclude investigations.

49,"Are Murkomen, Mutula Jnr in conflict of interest for representing Sonko in graft case?","The dramatic arrest and arraignment of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has sparked debate after two elected senators were part of his legal team in his graft case.
While some critics say Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and his Makueni counterpart Mutula Kilonzo Jr were acting in conflict of interest, others say the duo owe no one an explanation as they were representing Sonko in their individual capacity as advocates.
Murkomen is the Senate Majority Leader while Mutula is the Senate Minority Chief Whip.

 

The two are part of the 12 advocates that lined up in court to defend the governor who is facing 19 counts related to corruption and other economic crimes at City Hall.
Siaya Senator James Orengo has also continued his legal practice despite the fact that he is a legislator.
Orengo represents Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong who is also facing graft charges.
What did President Uhuru Kenyatta say?
During the 56th Jamuhuri Day celebrations at the Nyayo National Stadium, President Uhuru Kenyatta was applauded to asking civil servants to stick to their jobs.
Uhuru said the Rule of Law, Good Governance, Integrity, Transparency and Accountability are the pillars of our constitutional democracy.The President said on assumption of state office or public office, the officers become the trustees of the people; with a constitutional, statutory and moral duty to administer public affairs and resources in fidelity with the law, and strictly for the benefit of the people. 

 

“State and public officers are not above law.  Our constitutional order is a jealous one; it demands that state and public officers serve no other master but it,” he said.
Uhuru added, “One cannot serve as a legislator at the National or County Level while at the same time practising law, whether or not for gain.   In the same way, judges and magistrates cease completely any legal practice while in office, similarly doctors, engineers, accountants and other professionals who take up state or public office, should give up private practice and devote their full time, energies and focus on public duties; and without the perception that they are using state or public office as a mere platform to advance other interests.”
“Is it fair and right for legislators who have control over funds and exercise oversight over the Judiciary to appear in courts as counsel?  Is it fair on the judicial officer hearing the case or the other parties that, one party in the case is represented by persons who can literally change the law applicable to the dispute, control the career progression of the judge or magistrate or are able to speak with the voice of an entire arm of Government?”.  
According to the president, the position is simple, “you either serve the public in the role you signed up for or you serve the Republic as a private practitioner; it is a profound conflict of interest to do both”.
What did critics say?
Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja said the legal move the two senators adopted prejudices their duty as senators who have the mandate to oversee counties.
Sakaja in a radio interview said Murkomen and Mutula are not just senators but leaders representing their parties in the house.
“That is an absolute conflict of interest. It is true the governor can have the lawyers of his choice or the best legal mind. But imagine a scenario where a court of appeal judge appearing as a lawyer for one of the judges accused in a matter,” he said.Steve Ogolla on twitter posted, “THE SENATE has a special mandate to oversight counties. As a consequence, Sen. Murkomen and Mutula Kilonzo have no right to appear in court on behalf of Gov. Sonko, unless they want to create the crisis of reverse oversight. The conflict of interest is massive and irreconcilable”.
His sentiments were echoed by advocate Donald Kipkorir who said, “Article 77 of the Constitution bars State Officers from engaging in any other gainful employment. Lawyers who are Senators & MPs break this Constitutional provision with impunity whenever they practice law. EACC, DPP & LSK should enforce this Article. Constitution is Supreme”.
What does the law say on the role of the Senate?
Article 96 of the Constitution gives the senate the exclusive mandate to protect counties and their governments.
It is the senate and the county assemblies that consider and vote on the financial accounts of the 47 county governments.
As senators, Murkomen and Kilonzo Jr will have to cast their vote when the matter finally gets to the House through the report of the watchdog committee that considers the accounts.
What does the Advocates Act say?
Murkomen argues that there is the presumption of innocence on the part of Sonko and that nothing in the law stops him from representing a client.
“What you are seeing is a coordinated assault on the counties and their governments,” Murkomen said, adding that he got involved in the case in line with Article 96, which mandates the senate to protect counties.
He argued that the issue was merely cropping up because of his involvement in the case.But the Advocates Act states that no person shall be qualified to act as an advocate unless he has been admitted as an advocate,  his name is for the time being on the Roll and has in force a practising certificate.
“Qualification for admission as advocate Subject to this Act, no person shall be admitted as an advocate unless he is a citizen of Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda or Tanzania and he is duly qualified in accordance with section 13,” the Act reads in part.
With regards to professional and academic qualifications, the Act states that a person shall be duly qualified if having passed the relevant examinations of any recognised university in Kenya he holds, or has become eligible for the conferment of, a degree in law of that university; or  having passed the relevant examinations of such university, university college or other institution as the Council of Legal Education may from time to time approve, he holds, or has become eligible for conferment of, a degree in law in the grant of that university, university college or institution which the Council may in each particular case approve.
DPP's PROTEST
The issue of legislators representing clients in court became  part of a heated debate between the DPP Noordin Hajji, Siaya Senator James Orengo and Nyamira Senator Okong’o Omogeni in the petition filed by Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu after her arrest and arraignment in court.Hajji filed an application in the high court seeking the disqualification of Orengo and Omogeni from acting for DCJ Mwilu, because by virtue of their positions as lawmakers, they had accessed information that prejudiced the prosecution case.But the High Court ruled that a party alleging a conflict of interest bears the burden of presenting clear evidence that the person said to be acting in conflict of interest is acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the other party.Constitutional lawyerThe Star sought an interpretation from a constitutional lawyer over the matter.According to Kibe Mungai, a situation where legislators act as counsels for any accused public servant is an absolute conflict of interest.Mungai said are earning a full time salary from the tax payer’s money and thus such a move exposes the integrity of such individuals.“Imagine a scenario where a lawyer is appointed as a PS who is the accounting officer in any given docket. Can this lawyer PS someday appear in court to represent another PS accused of graft,” Mungai posed.According to him, Senators and MPs are state officers who are remunerated and cannot purport to defend another state officer accused by the same state.VERDICTThese claims are mostly true.In our analysis we have established that these legislators are giving the members of the public a raw deal.They are taking advantage of the omission of law on conflict of interests to engage in private business.This is backed up by the fact that President Uhuru Kenyatta on Jamhuri day directed the Attorney-General to fast-track the submission to Cabinet for approval and transmittal to Parliament, the Law on Conflict of Interest, which has been subject to stakeholders consultation.This bill states that  a public official is in conflict of interest if the official exercises an official power, duty or function that provides an opportunity to further the official’s private interests or those of the official’s relatives or friends or to improperly further another person’s interests.A public servant will be in conflict of interest  in a situation where the official’s private interests can reasonably be perceived to impair or influence the official’s ability to act objectively in the performance of an official duty; or  has private interests that could conflict with the official’s duties in future.Currently Kenya has no institutional framework for the management of conflict of interest.Such framework will ensure the regulation and management of real, apparent or potential conflict between public interest and private interest.",FACT CHECK
50,Taita Taveta MCAs impeached Governor Granton Samboja,"A Facebook post claiming that Members of the Taita Taveta County Assembly have impeached Governor Granton Samboja is TRUE.
The post adds that Samboja will appear before the Senate to defend himself.On October 9, 30 Taita Taveta ward representatives unanimously voted in favor of a motion introduced by the assembly’s Deputy Majority Leader Harris Keke to impeach Governor Samboja.
Taita Taveta County Assembly confirmed the governor’s impeachment in a statement on its official Facebook account. The statement reads in part,“The following grounds were cited by the Motion mover: the governor has been accused of gross misconduct, misleading the County Assembly, misappropriation of funds contrary to public finance Act 2012, stalled projects, misrepresentation of facts to the public with the aim of inciting the public against the County Assembly, failure to submit to the County Assembly an annual report on the implementation status of the County policies and plans as required by the County Government Act,2012, failure to adhere to County Assembly resolution on ratification of Mr. Davis Mwangoma as the acting County Executive Committee Member for Finance and Economic Planning.”Additionally, Mata Ward MCA Hon Nobert Chanzu accused the governor of not delivering a State of the County Address since he was elected into office in 2017.
The governor has been entangled in a three-month tussle with the ward representatives over ward budgetary allocations, and by the time of his impeachment, Samboja was in the process of collecting signatures from residents of Taita Taveta County in a bid to petition the president to dissolve the county assembly.

51,These underwater photos are not from the Likoni Channel,"A Facebook post with images claiming to show vehicles on the floor of the Likoni Channel is FALSE.
The post appears to link this to the search for the bodies of a woman and her daughter who drowned in the Indian Ocean after the vehicle they were in slipped off the Likoni Ferry and sank on September 29.A reverse image search shows that the photos are not from the Likoni Channel as claimed in the post.The first image is from a video taken by Chris Roxburgh, a hobbyist diver based in Michigan. The video was recorded at Old Mission Peninsula in Michigan, and Chris first posted it to his Facebook page on April 30, 2018, and to his YouTube channel in October of the same year.The video was republished alongside an article in the Detroit Free Press on May 8, 2018, as well as on the MLive.com Facebook page dedicated to news from Michigan.
Confirming to PesaCheck that he took the video that the photo was extracted from, Chris Roxburgh stated that the model of the car is a 1979 Ford Pinto, and the video and image were both was shared on a number of news outlets, including USA Today, the Detroit Free Press and the Grand Rapids Press.
A reverse image search of the second photo shows that it is from this video shared on YouTube apparently showing an abandoned or crashed car found 200 metres under water. The video was published on July 24, 2016. The video was credited to Krzysztof Starnawaski, a technical diver.
A reverse image search of the third photo shows that it was published on AquaViews, a blog dedicated to content about diving, on July 5, 2009. The article states that the photo is of the remains of MS Zenobia, a Swedish-built ferry, which capsized and sank near Larnaca in Cyprus during its maiden voyage in June 1980. MS Zenobia was carrying a cargo of trucks that can still be seen under the water, and the wreck is a popular dive site. The photo was also shared by Blaze Press, in March 24, 2015.
The photos in the Facebook post claiming that they are from Likoni are all from different locations, and the post attempts to link them to an incident at the Likoni Channel in Mombasa, where a car sank after slipping off the Likoni Ferry.

52,"Ranitidine, drug used to treat heartburn, withdrawn from Kenyan market","A Facebook post claiming that Ranitidine, a drug used to treat heartburn, will no longer be available in Kenya is TRUE.
Ranitidine is an over the counter and prescription drug which relieves heartburn and is sold in Kenya as Neotack. The post adds that the ban order was issued after the drug was linked to cancer in the United States.
On September 2, the Pharmacy and Poisons Board issued a directive to pharmacies in Kenya to retrieve and quarantine all medicines that contain ranitidine sold in local pharmacies. The Board also asked doctors to prescribe available alternative medicines adding that Kenya will not import any more ranitidine products.

 

On September 13, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that tests on the drug found low levels of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen.
The report by the FDA added that the organization is not asking individuals to stop taking ranitidine at the moment. However, it asked patients taking ranitidine prescription who wish to discontinue the drug use to talk to their doctors about other treatment options.
According to the World Health Organization, NDMA can occur in drinking-water through the degradation of dimethylhydrazine (a component of rocket fuel) as well as from several other industrial processes.”

SportPesa announced the decision to halt operations in Kenya, citing the excise tax on all betting stakes as a contributing factor.
Pevans East Africa, Sportpesa’s holding company, had sued the Betting Control and Licencing Board for damages resulting from loss of business and a breach of fundamental rights following the board’s decision to suspend their paybill numbers and betting shortcodes, as well as those of 26 other companies and lotteries in July.The decision to shut down operations in Kenya has not affected SportPesa’s operations in other countries. Sportpesa had previously withdrawn sponsorships for all Kenyan teams following the imposition of a 35 percent tax on its earnings, but this was reinstated following consultations with the government.
With the most recent suspension of operations, the company has stated that this decision would stand ‘until such time that adequate taxation and non-hostile regulatory environment is returned in Kenya’.

The post adds that Mariga is a duly registered voter and will be Jubilee’s candidate in the Kibra by-election.
On September 10, IEBC returning officer for Kibra Beatrice Muli invalidated Mariga’s candidature on grounds that he was not a registered voter as is required in Chapter 8 of the Constitution of Kenya.
Mariga filed an appeal challenging IEBC’s decision to invalidate his candidature for the by-election set for November 7. In his complaint, he stated that he registered as a voter on August 26, 2019 at the Kariokor Social Hall polling station. The IEBC Dispute Resolution Committee heard submissions from interested parties on September 13, and delivered a ruling on the matter on September 16.In the ruling the IEBC’s Dispute Resolution committee reversed the decision invalidating Mariga’s candidature. The committee chaired by the commission chair Wafula Chebukati reversed the ruling on the grounds that Mariga is a duly registered voter in Starehe constituency, and therefore eligible to contest the Kibra by-elections. Chebukati directed the commission’s returning officer to process Mariga’s application as stipulated by the law.

61,Kenya is the third African country to introduce malaria vaccine,"An article published by CGTN Africa claiming that Kenya has become the third African nation to introduce a new malaria vaccine and finds it to be TRUE.
The article further adds that the vaccine that is being administered through routine immunization, and that it targets children aged two years and below.
The vaccine, known as RTS,S, is the first vaccine to protect children against malaria infections, and will be given to young children from the ages of six months in a phased pilot introduction program in Homa Bay, Siaya, Migori, Kisumu, Busia, Vihiga, Bungoma and Kakamega counties.
The eight counties are considered are considered to have the highest malaria transmission rates in the country.The phased introduction of the malaria vaccine took place on September 13 in Ndhiwa in Homa Bay county, and was presided over by Health Cabinet Secretary Cecily Kariuki. The Ministry of Health tweeted that Kenya is the third African country to launch the malaria vaccine after Malawi and Ghana.Malaria kills over 400,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa annually with the majority of these people being young children. In 2016, malaria caused around 3.5 million infections that resulted in over 10,000 deaths.
According to a 2017 World Health Organization report, children below the age of five are the most vulnerable to malaria, accounting for 61 percent (266,000) of deaths due to the disease worldwide. The 2015 Malaria Indicator Survey by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics reveals that the risk of malaria infection is high in areas around Lake Victoria and the Coast, with children under the age of five and pregnant women being the most vulnerable.
The RTSS malaria vaccine is the first vaccine that has proved to provide partial protection against malaria on young children. It is the first malaria vaccine in the country to be provided to children through the national immunization program.
An efficiency and safety trial for the new malaria vaccine was conducted between 2009 to 2014 in seven African countries including Kenya,Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania.
The efficacy of the vaccine was established in a Phase 3 clinical trial that ended in 2014. The injectable vaccine has been on trial for several years after its development in 1987.

63,Meru County has suspended the issuance of new alcohol licenses to dealers,"A Facebook post claiming that Meru County Alcoholic Drinks Control Board has suspended the issuance of new licenses to bar owners in the county until January 1, 2020, is TRUE.
According to the post, the suspension was prompted by the sale of second-generation liquor brands and illicit brews in the county, as well as non-compliance of operating hours by the dealers.
In a phone conversation with PesaCheck, Meru County Alcoholic Drinks and Control Board Chairman Kimathi Kigatiira confirmed that the board has suspended the issuance of new licenses to bar owners following the discovery that some bars with valid liquor licenses were selling second-generation liquor brands and illicit brews.
Second generation alcoholic drinks that are made by mixing neutral food-grade ethanol with water and flavours rather than going through the standard distillation process, meaning it is cheaper and contains more alcohol by volume than conventional spirits.
We are aware of bar owners who are selling illicit brews and second-generation liquor such as Simba Waragia in Igembe subcounty. We have already begun a crackdown to catch those selling illicit brews in the county-Mr Kimathi Kigatiira.
The Meru County board has directed bar owners to adhere to the rules stipulated in their operating licenses regarding operating hours, age limitations and the quality of the brands they sell.

The video adds that Kenya becomes the fifth country to export the fruit to China after Chile, Mexico, Peru and New Zealand.
This comes after Kenya’s Ministry of Trade announced on September 5 that a consignment of avocados had been cleared for import by Chinese authorities after meeting all the market requirements.President Uhuru Kenyatta and President Xi Jinping signed a deal in April 2019 allowing Kenya to export Hass avocados to China.

67,TRUE: Long-serving capital offenders can now be released after serving two-thirds of their jail terms,"A Facebook post claiming that the High Court of Kenya has quashed a section of the law that denied capital offenders remission is TRUE.
The post that has been queued as potentially false, says that Justice George Odunga made the ruling at the Machakos High Court. Justice Odunga termed the clause discriminatory, saying that it is unfair for capital offenders to be denied the right to have their sentences reduced due to good behaviour, ill-health, or on other special grounds.
The post further adds that this was based on the assumption that those found guilty of capital offences were incapable of reform.
In his ruling at the Machakos Law Courts, Justice Odunga declared Section 46 of the Prisons Act, which condemned capital offenders to serve their sentences in full unconstitutional.
Justice Odunga argued that the dignity of a prisoner is ignored if he is denied remission that is available to others serving similar sentences, simply on the irrational presumption that he is incapable of reforming.
The case had been filed by five persons convicted of robbery with violence serving sentences ranging from 15 to 40 years. The five challenged a section of the Prisons Act saying that it contravenes Article 27 of the constitution, which guarantees equality and freedom from discrimination.
The five argued that since remission is not granted to prisoners sentenced for life or for an offence under section 296(2) of the Penal Code, capital offenders are treated unequally.
PesaCheck has looked into the claim that long-serving capital offenders can now be released after serving two-thirds of their jail terms and finds it to be TRUE.

The post and its accompanying photos allege that the MTN mast was set on fire due to MTN’s South African ownership, and it was shared after reports emerged of Nigerians and other foreigners being attacked in South Africa.
However, a reverse image search reveals that the photos in the post are from a 2015 fire in Akwa Ibom in Nigeria, not in 2019 as the post claims.
MTN is a South African mobile telecommunications company with a presence in 21 African countries, including Nigeria where it is the largest mobile operator.

The post that has been queued as potentially false says that a majority of Nyeri county MCA’s opposed the Punguza Mizigo draft bill by Thirdway Alliance Party party leader Ekuru Aukot even before it is debated saying that its proposals are not practical.
Nyeri County Assembly speaker John Kaguchia told PesaCheck that the bill was only presented to the county ward representatives on August 28. He added that some of the ward reps expressed concerns with some clauses as it was being presented.
Kaguchia said that the bill would be formally debated by the assembly, after which the ward representatives will vote. He added that the debates and voting will happen before the deadline for the vote that has been set for October.
Thirdway Alliance Party leader Ekuru Aukot who was in Nyeri told PesaCheck that currently the party is formally presenting the Punguza Mizigo Bill in county assemblies across the country. He added that the assemblies are expected to discuss the bill before eventually voting on it.
The Punguza Mizigo bill majorly seeks to reduce the number of elected positions by cutting the number of MP’s from the current 416 to 147, and doing away with the 290 constituencies, using the 47 counties each as a single constituency instead.

71,MIXTURE: World Bank did not withdraw from James Gichuru-Rironi Road project over inflated costs,"An article published by the Kenyan Bulletin, an online publication, claiming that World Bank has withdrawn from funding James Gichuru — Rironi Road project is a MIXTURE.
According to the article, the World Bank ‘bolted out’ of the project because of the inflated price by the government.
While it is true that World Bank withdrew from the James Gichuru-Rironi road project, the withdrawal was due to a request by the National Treasury to cancel the project, and not because of inflated costs as alleged in the article.
According to the World Bank, the construction of the James Gichuru-Rironi road was to be implemented as part of the National Urban Transport Improvement Project (NUTIP). The project was cancelled in December 2018 upon request by the National Treasury.While the World Bank had approved the James Gichuru-Rironi Road project in September 2012, the government opted to reallocate funds meant for this project to other more promising projects, which the World Bank has attributed to the slow pace of implementation.
It is standard practice for the government and the World Bank to review the performance of projects which can sometimes result in partial cancellations and restructurings as we respond to changing priorities and developments on the ground, Vera Rosauer, the World Bank’s Communication Officer for the Africa region, told PesaCheck via email.
According to the National Urban Transport Improvement Project implementation report, the delay in implementation of major contracts such as the James Gichuru — Rironi road project among others was caused by the change from a centralised system to a devolved system of government in Kenya, leading to gaps in financing, project design, and implementation of proposed activities that could not be accomodated.The document further shows that the improvement of James Gichuru-Rironi road project was still in progress as at March 15, 2019, and has been listed under ongoing road projects by Kenya National Highways Authority(KeNHA) with progress at 18 percent.

73,MISLEADING: Eating ugali has not been directly linked to cervical cancer,"An article published by Parents Africa Magazine titled: “Ugali linked to cervical cancer” has a FALSE HEADLINE.
The article that has been queued as potentially false, purports that eating ugali has been linked to cancer, specifically cervical cancer in women.
The article cites research carried out on women at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in a paper titled “Detection and concentration of plasma aflatoxin is associated with detection of oncogenic human papillomavirus in Kenyan women” published in the Open Forum Infectious Diseases (OFID) Journal.
According to the paper, chronic ingestion of aflatoxin in food products increases the risk of cervical cancer among women. While high levels of aflatoxin have been linked to cancer of the liver, but there is limited data on the effects of aflatoxin on other human cancers.
Aflatoxin is a poison produced by the Aspergillus fungus, and it affects cereals, nuts, and other dry foods during storage or in the field. Aflatoxin poisoning is a food safety and security issue, particularly for people living in developing countries with temperate and tropical climates. Aflatoxins occur when food is poorly stored, and pose a serious health threat to humans and livestock.
Dietary aflatoxin is a potent carcinogen, and the study identifies contaminated maize meal — the main ingredient in ugali — as well as contaminated sorghum, millet, groundnuts and milk, as the most likely sources. Repeated exposure to dietary aflatoxin also has the potential to weaken the immune system, leaving the body less able to destroy cancer cells.
The study states that consuming contaminated corn products, could be a contributing factor to the rising cases of cervical cancer among women in the country. Research on cervical cancer shows that Human Papillomavirus infection is also a contributing factor in causing cervical cancer.
However, the study worked with a small sample of 86 women, and out these, 49, or 57 per cent, tested positive for aflatoxin. The prevalence of HPV was found to be high among the women who also tested positive for aflatoxin, but this alone is not conclusive enough for a definitive link to be made between the two.
Aflatoxins are likely to be a cofactor in addition to the human papillomavirus (HPV), making infection more likely to lead to cancer. While most women with HPV don’t automatically develop cervical cancer, risk factors such as smoking and HIV infection increases the risk of developing cancer among women exposed to the virus.
However, no definitive link has been established between HPV and consuming food with aflatoxins.

Teresa, who spoke to PesaCheck, added that Desert Rose Ministries, the organization that she and her husband set up for her ministry work, has rescued girls in Baringo from FGM and child marriages since 2010, through in Baringo.
According to a statement issued by the Anti-FGM Board, Ms Estes did not undergo FGM, and it did not feature at all during her traditional Pokot wedding.
The Board, whose mandate is to advocate against FGM in Kenya, assured the public that the government of Kenya has zero tolerance towards FGM in the country.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that an American missionary in Baringo underwent Female Genital Mutilation ahead of her traditional Pokot wedding and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.

76,Online hoax: Huawei not offering free new year gifts,"A hoax that could be turned into a mega scam of personal information theft is circulating with the title of mobile phone and telecom technologies company Huawei.This has been circulating on social media platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook, emails and others.A  link to an unknown website is being received by the users with the title ‘Huawei New Year Gift’ and states Huawei provides free New Year gifts.The weblink is also using the logo of the company to deceive the users easily as the majority of the consumers are unaware of such a scam.These scams mainly resulted in stealing of the individual personal information and data including phonebooks, messages, videos and pictures, and sometimes passwords of various applications including financial accounts of banks and others in the use of individuals.On clicking of the link, it leads to the users to an unknown website which is displaying ‘New Year Gift’ and stated ‘more than 100 units of computer and mobile equipment, as well as 50 cash prizes ranging from $50 to $5000.""All you have to do is open the correct gift box. You have three tries, good luck!"" it says. Then it asks three questions, starting with the questions; Do you know Huawei? Which social software do you use more often? and which Huawei product do you want to buy as a New Year gift?Whichever answer you choose you get a notification awarding you with a gift box. It asks you to open the gift box.The process involves getting three attempts to open the gift boxes; in my case, they claim that I had won a Huawei phone.Further, it asks to share the promotion with five groups/20 friends on WhatsApp, Line, or Facebook. Interestingly, it gives you 600 seconds validity to avail the chance and when one click on “continue” to receive New Year gifts, it starts stealing individual personal information and data.An official from Huawei Kenya said there was nothing from the company regarding sharing of free gifts. The hoax is globally circulated from an unknown website and the company has nothing to do with it.Further, such scams use many world-known companies' logos to deceive users. Huawei did not run any of such promotions or have any relation to the currently circulating hoax.The company has cautioned the public to be vigilant and take reasonable precautions when encountering such websites as participating in it may result in data, identity theft or other frauds.The Star thus concludes the links are nothing but a hoax.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FACT CHECKER
77,FACT CHECK: Does Safaricom allow NIS to illegally forward your calls?,"A social media post claiming that telco Safaricom has allowed National Intelligence Service (NIS) to illegally forward your calls is false.The post largely forwarded on Whatsapp platforms reads “Safaricom allows NIS to illegally forward your call to 0722188188 against your right to privacy… To check if your call has been forwarded dial *#62#”Upon dialling the USSD code *#62#, it pops a message informing you that you have been enrolled to Call forwarding services.The post further instructs its readers to dial ##62# to remove forwards.On dialling ##62# the USSD code pops a message showing that you have opted out of the call notify services.Investigation on the claims shows that in a 2017 post on Twitter Safaricom notifies its customers that the number 0722188188 is for Call Notify Service while 0722199199 diverts to Voicemail.The call notify service allows subscribers to be notified by means of an SMS of people who tried to call them while they were either busy, had their phone off, or were out of coverage.The subscriber receives a message of  ‘I tried calling you, how many times and the specific time’ once he/she is available.The service is therefore not a secret security intelligence gathering technic but a call notification service.According to the company’s data privacy, your information can be disclosed to law-enforcement agencies, in response to a demand issued within the law and where the form and scope of the demand is compliant with the law.Other parties that you sign to agree to access your information are subsidiaries, associates, partners, software developers, or agents who are involved in delivering Safaricom products and services you order or use.Fraud prevention and Anti-money laundering agencies, credit reference agencies, debt collection agencies, survey agencies that conduct surveys on behalf of Safaricom, emergency service among others.The Star concludes the post is false.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie.",FALSE
78,MISLEADING: Bite from Brazilian spider causes four-hour erection,"A viral photo claiming that a bite from a Brazilian spider causes an erection lasting up to four hours is misleading.The photo, widely shared in WhatsApp groups, encouraged those with an erection disorder to try the spider to up their performance.This came up following an online publication claiming that the species contains a possible breakthrough for erectile dysfunction.“Most people who find a spider in their bedroom quickly try to get rid of it. But new research shows that one arachnid might actually be best kept by your bedside. A single bite from the Brazilian wandering spider has been shown to have side effects including a four-hour-long erection,” read part of the article.But Urologist Dr. Peter Mungai said an erection occurs when a man becomes sexually aroused allowing hormones, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels to work together.Mungai said penile erection involves neuron stimulation and production of hormones which has nothing to do with a spider bite.“This is just a good joke because a spider cannot produce the hormones or neurons needed to stimulate a penile erection,” he said.“If it is true that such information is doing rounds then it could be by some sadists who do not understand the mechanism of erection,” he added.The neurons in these hypothalamic nuclei contain peptidergic neurotransmitters, including oxytocin and vasopressin, which may be involved in penile erection.Several brain stem and medullary centres are also involved in sexual function.For an erection to occur, nerve signals sent from the brain to the penis stimulate muscles to relax in turn, allowing blood to flow to the tissue in the penis.Once the blood fills the penis and an erection is achieved, the blood vessels to the penis close off so that the erection is maintained.Following sexual arousal, the blood vessels to the penis open up again, allowing the blood to leave.However several studies here indicate that the Brazilian wandering spiders' venom is a complex cocktail of toxins, proteins and peptides which affects ion channels and chemical receptors in victims' neuromuscular systems.The wandering spiders, also called armed spiders or banana spiders, belong to the genus Phoneutria, which means ""murderess"" in Greek. And it's no wonder why — it's one of the most venomous spiders on Earth.After a human is bitten by one of these spiders, he or she may experience initial symptoms such as severe burning pain at the site of the bite, sweating and goosebumps.Within 30 minutes, symptoms become systemic and include high or low blood pressure, fast or a slow heartbeat, nausea, abdominal cramping, hypothermia, vertigo, blurred vision, convulsions and excessive sweating associated with shock.In addition to intense pain and possible medical complications, the bite of a Brazilian wandering spider can deliver a long, painful erection to human males because the venom boosts nitric oxide, a chemical that increases blood flow.People who are bitten by a Brazilian wandering spider should seek medical attention immediately.Several studies are looking at incorporating the venom into drugs for erectile dysfunction.However, these bites are rare, and envenomations are usually mild.The Star’s fact check concludes that while it is true a bite from this spider may cause an erection, it is a painful erection which is a disorder due to the venom.The information is thus misleading.",FACT CHECKER
