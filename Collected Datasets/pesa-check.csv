1,Joyful Women Organization is not taking loan applications through an online form,"A claim made on Facebook that the Joyful Women Organization (JOYWO) is offering loans through an online application form, is FALSE.The online form, posted on Inua Mama na JOYWO page, gives more details on the loan.According to the post, a loan application is processed in five to 10 minutes, although the online form indicates 20 minutes.The link directs interested applicants to a Google form, where they are required to fill in their personal details and pay a registration fee of KSh 315.Joyful Women Organization (JOYWO) is a registered non-governmental organization in Kenya, founded in 2009 to empower women economically through table banking. JOYMO offers credit facilities to ensure that women earn income through sustainable livelihood activities.Speaking to PesaCheck, Jane Muthoni, a representative at JOYWO, said that the organization does not charge a registration fee, and does not offer loans online. She added that JOYWO does not issue loans to individuals, but to women groups.“We offer loans to women in groups of 10–35 women. When a group expresses interest to join the organization, a JOYWO representative is sent to the group to explain how the organization works before registering the group. After registration, the group has to save money for at least 6 months before accessing a loan,” Ms Muthoni added.Facebook Page Transparency shows that the authentic JOWYO page was registered on April 22, 2013, while the imposter loans page was registered on January 20, 2021, the same time the page started sharing misinformation online.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Joyful Women Organization (JOYWO) is offering loans through an online form posted on Inua Mama na JOYWO page, and finds it to be FALSE.",HOAX:

6,tourism contribute 24% of Kenya’s GDP and employ 1.6 million people?,"On May 12, 2020, Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala tweeted that tourism forms 24 percent of Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and also employs about 1.6 million people.Mr Balala was making a case for tourism as an important pillar for the Kenyan economy, saying flattening the COVID-19 curve was crucial to jumpstarting the country’s financial state.The CS did not, however, indicate the source of this information.So, the question is, how true are these claims by Mr Balala about the tourism sector in Kenya?PesaCheck has examined each of the two claims and found out the following:Claim 1: Tourism contributes 24% of Kenya’s GDPVerdict: FALSEA United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report published in 2017 stated that the sector’s average share in real GDP between 2011 and 2014 was 10.9 percent.The report defines “direct contribution to GDP” as that which is generated by industries that deal directly with tourists, including hotels, travel agents, airlines and other passenger transport services, as well as the activities of restaurant and leisure industries that deal directly with tourists.The 2020 Economic Survey Report indicates that nominal GDP, which is the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in a country evaluated at current market prices, increased from KSh 8,892.1 billion in 2018 to KSh 9,740.4 billion in 2019.Agriculture was the dominant sector during the period under review, accounting for slightly over a third of the total value of the economy. Other sectors that made notable contribution to the total economy included Transport and Storage (8.5 percent); Wholesale and Retail trade (7.6 percent); and Manufacturing (7.5 percent). Taxes on Products also contributed significantly to the GDP with a share of 8.5 percent.The report makes no mention of how much the Tourism sector contributes to the overall GDP, but indicates that the industry’s earnings grew by 3.9 percent, from KSh 157.4 billion in 2018 to KSh 163.6 billion in 2019.This was attributed to an increase in hotel bed-nights occupancy, the number of international visitor arrivals, the number of visitors to national parks and game reserves, and the number of international and local conferences, among other factors.Tourism growth was further cited as one of the factors that contributed to the improved performance of the transport and storage sector, whose value of output increased by 12.1 percent, from KSh 1,248.6 billion in 2018 to KSh 1, 399.4 billion in 2019.Similarly, Conference tourism, which expanded by 14.0 percent in 2019, was one of the factors that contributed to the increase in the performance of the accommodation and food services sector, whose gross value added rose by 10.3 percent compared to 16.6 percent growth in 2018.The Revised National Tourism Policy (draft), 2020 on Enhancing Sustainable Tourism in Kenya states that the industry contributes 9 percent to the GDP aside from accounting for over 10 percent of total employment.Another report published by the National Treasury and Planning in June 2020, dubbed the “Second Voluntary National Review Report on the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals” indicated that that the tourism sector’s direct contribution as a proportion of total GDP was 0.7 percent in 2019.The World Travel and Tourism Council’s (WTTC) key highlights of its 2020 annual research of Kenya’s Tourism sector places its contribution to the GDP at 8.2 percent.Given that the value of tourism according to all the aforementioned reports is lower than 24 percent, the claim by Mr Balala the sector contributes almost a quarter of the GDP is, therefore FALSE.Claim 2: Tourism employs about 1.6 million KenyansVerdict: TRUEMuch of the available data appears to support the claim by Mr Balala that tourism employs 1.6 million people.The Tourism ministry’s strategic plan covering the period 2018–2022 states that the sector contributes 9 percent of the total employment per annum.Given that the Economic Survey 2020 by KNBS estimates total employment in the country at 18.1 million, the 9 percent mentioned in the Tourism Ministry’s strategic plan translates to 1.6 million people.But the KNBS figure for total employment in the country excludes those engaged in small-scale farming and pastoralist activities, which means if this number could be factored in, the number of workers in the tourism sector could significantly go up.According to a 2009 paper titled ‘Economic Contribution of Tourism in Kenya’ by Elisabeth Valle and Mark Nelson Yobesia, Tourism accounted for an average of 9 percent of modern private and public sector direct employment in Kenya, in the period between 1995 and to 2001. This also takes into account the lack of data on indirect employment, particularly in the informal sector.The same WTTC annual research of Kenya’s Tourism sector published in March 2020, also shows the sector employs 1,579, 500, which is equivalent to 8.5 percent of total employment in the country.In light of the aforementioned, CS Balala’s second part of the claim is, therefore, TRUE, given that much of the available evidence supports his assertion that tourism employs 1.6 million people.However, it is important to note that the missing link in both the first and second half of the claim could be the absence of a standard statistical framework described by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA).Developed by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the OECD, the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and the United Nations Statistics Division, the TSA is claimed to be the main tool for the economic measurement of tourism.The effectiveness of the TSA in measuring tourism stems from how it contrasts data from the demand-side (the acquisition of goods and services by visitors while on a tourism trip) with data from the supply-side of the economy (the value of goods and services produced by industries in response to visitor expenditure).This allows for the harmonization and reconciliation of tourism statistics from an economic (National Accounts) perspective, thus enabling the generation of tourism economic data (such as Tourism Direct GDP) that is comparable with other economic statistics.Currently, the Kenya Tourism Institute has been set up to address the research and knowledge gaps that exist in the sector by generating data to inform decision making by the government and private sector on tourism matters.",Does

The “About’ tab on the page with the claim, however, shows users can access loans of up to KShs 100,000 with an interest rate of 6 percent.To qualify, the borrower must be over 18 years and have a mobile money service account such as M-Pesa or Airtel, which has been active for at least two months.A registration fee of KShs 300 is payable through a personal number, which is included in the application instructions, with a promise that the money will be refunded to unsuccessful applicants.Instructions on the page also indicate that the loan will be sent directly to the borrower’s mobile money account.After paying the fee, the applicant is required to enter the mobile money transaction code along with other personal details into the registration form provided and indicate how much they want to borrow.However, Equity Bank told PesaCheck that their loans are offered via their branded banking applications, and asked customers to be vigilant.“Our loans are offered via Equitel and our Eazzy Banking App. Kindly be vigilant and don’t share your account information online,” Laurene Wambui, a customer service manager from Equity Bank said.To qualify for an Equitel loan the applicant must have an Equity Bank account or an Equitel line that has been active for a minimum of six months.Facebook Page Transparency details show that the account with the claim, named ‘Equity 254’, was opened on January 19, 2021, around the same time the offer showed up online. Equity Bank’s legitimate Facebook page — that has no information about this alleged loan offer — was created in 2012.A WhoIs search of the registration of the domain https://www.eazyapp.club/ indicates it was registered on January 1, 2021. No details of the registrant are provided.On the other hand, the URL for Equity’s legitimate website is equitel.com, which was created in May 2002 and whose ownership details are shown.PesaCheck has previously debunked fake lending app schemes, where applicants are asked to pay a fee before their loans can be processed.Additionally, the Digital Lenders Association of Kenya told PesaCheck in a past interview that genuine lenders do not ask customers to pay a registration fee or a Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) fee in order to apply for loans, adding that such demands for upfront payments are characteristic of fraudulent schemes.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Equity Bank is giving loans through an online form that asks applicants to pay a registration fee and finds it is a HOAX.",HOAX:

UDA is associated with the allies of Mr Ruto. The kicker also directs readers to page six for the full story.The cover page includes headshots of the two politicians composed into a single image.The Facebook post itself appears to poke fun at the two politicians for joining the faction allied to the DP, otherwise known as ‘TangaTanga,’ and suggests they were duped into believing that they would deputise Mr Ruto.“It’s now about 17 months to the general election and Ruto has not settled on who will deputise him. Expect a mass exodus from Tangatanga soon,” reads the post in part.However, the front-page shared by the Saturday Nation on its Twitter and Facebook pages on the said date contains a different lead story, indicating that the cover page shared in the post with the claim has been doctored.The lead story of the legitimate front-page of Saturday Nation is about the rise of Ann Kananu, the administrator who was sworn in as the deputy governor of Nairobi County on January 15, 2021.The image of the authentic front-page of the publication also carries images of Ms Kananu and of Mr Sonko and none of Mr Kuria and Mr Gachagua.In a phone interview with PesaCheck, Mr Augustine Sang, the audience engagement producer at Nation Africa, dismissed the front page as fake saying the publication did not run such a story.PesaCheck has looked into the image of the front-page of the January 16, 2021 edition of the Saturday Nation, and finds it to be ALTERED.",ALTERED:

16,Facebook pages to Google forms: How to spot a lending scam,"The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the finances of many Kenyans, hitting the majority of low-income earners especially hard. Many are turning to digital money lenders to bail them out when finances are constrained.The demand for mobile loans has given rise to a fast-growing and lucrative digital lending space that has proved to be both a boon and bane for an estimated six million digital borrowers.Boon, because it serves as a stitch in time for those struggling to fend for themselves during these hard economic times, as digital lenders often process short-term loans within minutes or even seconds.Telecom firm Safaricom, for example, in its 2020 Sustainability Business Report, said it processes about six transactions every second on its mobile money overdraft facility, ‘Fuliza’, with the total amount of loans disbursed topping KSh 245 billion in just one year.Conversely, the digital lending space in Kenya remains largely unregulated, and dubious companies, out to defraud prospective borrowers, have cropped up, posing as bonafide lenders.PesaCheck’s investigations over recent weeks uncovered a number of dubious companies; some mimicking the identities of legitimate digital lending firms, or posing as legitimate government initiatives known for economically empowering citizens, making it increasingly difficult for consumers to tell them apart.Take, for example, this Facebook page claiming to offer online loans and using the branding and logo of ‘PesaPap’, a Family Bank-owned digital money application service.PesaCheck investigated and found the procedure for applying for the loan requires prospective borrowers to pay an activation and validation fee. The fee is payable through a mobile money paybill number provided, which is not the standard procedure when applying for a legitimate PesaPap loan.There was also the page bearing the name and logo of Uwezo Fund, a Kenyan government initiative that provides loans to groups of youth, women and people with disabilities, claiming to offer unsecured loans.PesaCheck looked into it and established it is not the fund’s legitimate Facebook page. Further, a link from the page leads to a Google form rather than to the Uwezo Fund website.Presumably faced by numerous queries and complaints from users who had been conned, Uwezo Fund posted a notice on its Facebook page, warning the public against engaging with the scammers or paying any processing fees for the ‘loans’.The notice added that the criminals have been drawing content from its legitimate social media pages to disguise themselves for their nefarious activities.Scammers do not only disguise themselves as legitimate digital lenders or government institutions to ensnare unsuspecting borrowers. Others use fictitious brand names while falsely claiming to be registered as digital lenders in Kenya.Some of these ‘lenders’ that PesaCheck has investigated include 254WEZA LOANS, Jikwamue Loans, Mwananchi Loans, and Waraka LoansKE. PesaCheck discovered that none of these companies is a registered lender as they claim.Additionally, the four “lenders” require prospective clients to send some sort of fee via a mobile money transfer number before submitting the loan application via Google form. However, the paybill numbers provided on the Google forms are registered under different companies from those purportedly offering the loans.After sending money to the paybill number provided by 254WEZA LOANS, the notification reads that the fee goes to WEZAWEZA BUSINESS. Registration fees for Jikwamue and Mwananchi Loans are sent to ALLIED SPOT FRONTIER, while Waraka LoansKE registration fees goes to ARCADE PREMIER 1.Curiously, ARCADE PREMIER and ALLIED SPOT FRONTIER appear to be the most notorious of the scammers, having appeared, at least twice, in the investigations conducted by PesaCheck.So how can you tell if a digital lender is legitimate or a scammer? Here’s how:The increasing digital lending scams in Kenya have not gone unnoticed by authorities, with the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) issuing a notice in 2018 cautioning members of the public against engaging fraudulent digital platforms and services.Additionally, Kevin Mutiso, the chief executive officer of the Digital Lenders Association of Kenya (DLAK) — an association that vets members and seeks to promote best practices in lending and consumer protection — also shed light on characteristics of fraudulent mobile lenders.Both CBK and DLAK point out that platforms which require payment of a registration fee beforehand are usually dubious. Always be wary of any loan application procedure that asks you to send money before you receive the loan.Also, while they copy the look and feel of genuine financial institutions, companies which do not have customer care helplines or support mechanisms, do not have registered physical address information and display non-existent telephone numbers, websites and addresses are most likely scammers.In cases where a social media page claims to represent a digital lender you are familiar with, always double-check the legitimacy by visiting the website of the creditor, then following a link to their social media accounts.You can tell the two pages apart by looking at the information about when they were created. Look for the Facebook page transparency tab to find this information.

The safest place you can find the procedure of applying for a loan is the legitimate website of the lender.DLAK’s membership currently stands at 17, so if a lender is not listed on the association’s website, you can check their legitimacy online by running the company’s name through e-Citizen’s business registration service to ascertain whether they are an entity registered in Kenya.",From
17,"This note, purportedly written by former US President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden, is sarcastic","An Instagram post with a note purported to have been written by immediate former US President Donald Trump, to his successor, Joe Biden, is SATIRICAL.The letter, dated January 20, 2021, contains what appears to be the presidential seal and a signature of Mr Trump, with the words, “Joe, You know I won”.The note is an inauguration day tradition in the US, and has seen successive outgoing presidents leave a personal letter for their successor, to welcome them to the White House, the Oval Office and to extend best wishes.Examples of these letters include one from former President Barack Obama to his successor, Donald Trump and ex-President Reagan’s to George Bush.However, while President Biden confirmed that he had received a letter from Mr Trump, which he described as generous, he did not reveal the contents.Mr Biden told CNN he would not disclose the contents yet — out of respect for Mr Trump — saying, “Because it was private, I will not talk about it until I talk to him, but it was generous.”Nonetheless, a flurry of hilarious guesses of what the message would look like flooded the internet — the letter in question being one of them.The Instagram post in question did not, however, mention that the letter was shared in jest.PesaCheck has looked into the note purported to have been written by immediate former US President Donald Trump to his successor Joe Biden, and finds it to be SATIRE.",SATIRE:

19,This newspaper image with the headline ‘Kenyan wins lottery’ is fake,"A Twitter post with an image of a newspaper article from 2019 claiming that a Kenyan woman living in Serbia won the lottery is FALSE.The post is captioned, “This lady won kedo (sic) 25 billion KES and said she’d not donate even a cent to Kenya because of corruption. Anyway she will be using part of her prize money to help poor people in Serbia.”The newspaper clipping, purportedly carried by the Serbia Post, reports that that the woman, Purity Slavulj, said she would not give any of the KShs 699 million (6.05 million euros) prize money to Kenya, her native land, that she says is corrupt and the monies might end up in the wrong hands.PesaCheck searched the Library of Congress in Serbia and also did an online search, but found no information of any newspaper named Serbia Post.Further scrutiny reveals the screenshot is not a reproduction of a real newspaper article. The image was created using a fake newspaper clip generator which allows users to make their own realistic headlines in just a few minutes. The user simply picks a name for a fake newspaper, a title for a fake news article, writes a brief piece of text, and the website generates a passable image of a vintage newspaper clipping.As seen, some words are cut from the right side of the claim image, in similar fashion to the newspaper clipping generator example image above.PesaCheck reached out to Purity Slavulj, the vlogger and podcaster living in Serbia, and she confirmed that the image was a fake.PesaCheck has looked into the image of a 2019 newspaper clipping claiming that a Kenyan woman living in Serbia won the lottery and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
20,This Facebook post with an advert for jobs at Pepsi is fake,"A Facebook post with a link claiming that Pepsi, the multinational drinks manufacturing company, is recruiting to fill various positions in January 2021 is FALSE.The link was shared on a Facebook group with over 38,000 members spread over Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.The post advertising jobs at Pepsi contains a link directing applicants to a Google document. Instructions on the Google document further direct applicants to click an ‘enter now’ prompt, which leads to different surveys.After filling in their email address, applicants are asked to complete a series of questions in order to get a reward, with each answer leading to a new page.The questions asked are not related to any job opportunities. Rather, the page employs survey-like queries, which suggests it is most likely clickbait used by scammers to gather personal information.Once this is done, the user is redirected to another webpage that prompts them to choose a reward. The link to the webpage does not lead to the legitimate Pepsi website, and nothing on the site has anything to do with job opportunities at the beverage company.Responding to PesaCheck’s query, Pepsi said the job advert is illegitimate, adding, “Our recruitment process doesn’t include applicants clicking on phishing sites.”The company also confirmed that Pepsi’s authentic job advertisements are posted on the company’s global careers site.The advertised job opportunities do not feature in the careers section of Pepsi’s website nor on the company’s official Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Pepsi is recruiting for a January 2021 intake in various positions and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

We want to ensure ODM fields Luos to fill vacant electoral positions to enable us to have greater bargaining power in the National Government come 2022. Luos must be represented across the country.”Mr Odinga hails from the Luo community and his party, ODM, is among political outfits that is fielding a candidate in the upcoming Matungu by-election.The former immediate member of parliament for Matungu constituency, Justus Murunga, died in November 2020, and the seat was declared vacant by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on December 8, 2020.But did NTV Kenya — a private TV station in Kenya — post this tweet? We checked.Nation Media Group confirmed that the organisation did not post the tweet. Speaking to PesaCheck on phone, Churchill Otieno, the organisation’s managing editor, digital and convergence, said the tweet “is fabricated” and was not posted by the media house.PesaCheck also searched the NTV Kenya Twitter account and did not find the said post.There is also no evidence that Mr Odinga, who is active on Twitter, has posted such sentiments on his account.PesaCheck has looked into the authenticity of a screenshot posted on Facebook purported to be of a tweet by NTV Kenya, claiming that Raila Odinga has said ODM should field Luo candidates in vacant electoral positions and finds that it is FAKE.",FALSE:

You have been selected to benefit from the support provided by the GOK of funds worth KES 4100”.On the link page applicants are asked to complete a series of questions in order to get the funds, with each answer leading to a new page.Completing the process displays a message: “After considering your answers, set the subsidy amount to KES 4,100 and complete the steps to obtain the withdrawal code from the electronic counter”.Users are also notified that they may “get the subsidy with only one step” if they share the page with five groups or 15 friends on WhatsApp.The link to the webpage does not lead to any legitimate government ministry or department website, and does not specify which organ of government is involved in disbursement of the fund.The WHOIS information of the domain name gok-funds.com shows it was registered in Panama on January 17, 2020, indicating it is likely a phishing scam designed to harvest personal information.CyberSpace Kenya, an organisation involved in digital security and online safety in Kenya, confirmed to PesaCheck through a query box on their website that this is a scam.The representative from CyberSpace Kenya added that, “People need to be on the lookout for such tricksters. The site targets the public for phishing purposes.”Posts that ask people to share links on different platforms are often associated with engagement bait scams; the more people interact with such posts, the more people it reaches.Additionally, no such offer has been published on any of the Government of Kenya’s official platforms.PesaCheck has looked into a post claiming the Government of Kenya is giving cash to members of the public and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

But the image was captured in 2008 and is not related to the BBI campaigns as claimed. The caption reads in part, “Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga © runs away from tear gas fired by police during a mass funeral service for some victims of post-election violence in Nairobi 23 January 2008.” The photo is credited to AFP photographer Walter Astrada.A Google reverse image search of the second image brings up a number of articles published together with the image. One of the articles is by VOA News whose caption of the photo reads, “Residents run from teargas after throwing stones towards Kenyan police officials as they clash at Katwekera village within Kibera slum — a stronghold of opposition leader Raila Odinga — in Nairobi on October 26, 2017.”The photo is credited to AFP photographer Tony Karumba.PesaCheck has looked into the images claiming to show youth disrupting former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) rally in Embakasi, Nairobi, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

Results reveal that the image was cropped out of a bigger screenshot of a fabricated article which appears as if it was taken from the CNN website.An article on the legitimate CNN website would normally have a byline and a timestamp showing when it was published which is not the case with the screenshot in question. Also, the headline on a legitimate CNN website does not usually contain a fullstop, unlike the fabricated screengrab.While the claim states that the said recommendation by doctors to administer the COVID-19 vaccine through the penis was based on a study by the University of California, an internet search of the said study did not bring up any results.Additionally, the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, is done through the deltoid muscle, which is located between the upper arm and the shoulder, and not the penis as claimed.A further internet search shows that the medic pictured in the screenshot is Mohitkumar Ardeshana, a doctor of internal medicine at Claremont Medical Center in California. According to a fact-check by BOOM, Dr Ardeshana dismissed the article as fake, saying he was not involved in any such study.Additionally, the illustration in the screenshot appears to have been lifted from a manual about penile self-injection procedure for patients with erectile dysfunction (ED).PesaCheck has looked into the claim that doctors are encouraging the COVID-19 vaccine to be injected through the penis, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

29,on erroneous labelling of a Facebook image by State House Kenya,"An image posted on Facebook by State House Kenya was erroneously marked as false, and a PesaCheck fact-check published on December 4, 2019 was attached.The error appears to have originated from the automation system, which looks for similar content that has been fact-checked. In this case, both posts shared the same photo of Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni.But the post by State House did not have any false information that had been looked into by fact-checkers.Here’s what happened, leading to the error: Late last year, Facebook, which partners with third-party fact-checkers under the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), introduced internal changes to their platform, allowing fact-checkers to mark what in a post is false — text, photo/video, or both.Those changes were a big departure from what was done previously — where the whole post was given a rating without being precise from the onset. Specifics of what in a post was false were clarified in a fact-check, and not on the Facebook labels.In this case, the fact-check that was published in December 2019, which covered a false claim about President Museveni reshuffling his cabinet, had the same photo that was shared by State House. That photo had been marked as false, in the old system — because it was part of a post with misinformation.When State House used the same image, the Facebook automation system immediately marked it as false. Within 15 minutes of the post being made, we corrected to indicate that the photo wasn’t false.The Facebook automation system, using artificial intelligence, is meant to fight misinformation at scale.",Explainer

36,Barack Obama has not announced plans to run for president in Kenya,"A tweet published on December 28, 2020, claiming that former United States President Barack Obama has announced his intention to contest Kenya’s presidency in 2021, is FALSE.The claim seems to have originated from an article published by the World News Daily Report in 2020, titled, “Barack Obama announces intention to run as president of Kenya in 2021”. Mr Obama is alleged to have made the announcement when he ‘visited Mombasa County in Kenya in 2020’.The former US president also launched his own political party called the ‘National Democratic Party of Kenya’, the article adds.However, the information on the article is not a factual recounting of real-life events, and also wrongly states that Kenya’s next general election will be held in 2021.So far, Kenya’s general election is slated for 2022 as the Constitution of Kenya requires a presidential election to be held on the second Tuesday in August in every fifth year. Moreover, a list of all Kenyan political parties as published by the Office of the Registrar of Parties does not include the National Democratic Party of Kenya — the political outfit alleged to be Mr Obama’s party.Further, Article 137 of the Kenyan constitution states Mr Obama is not eligible to vie for presidency in Kenya because he is not a citizen of the country by birth and owes allegiance to a foreign state. Even though his father, Barack Obama Senior, was a Kenyan citizen, the former president’s birth certificate shows he was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, in the US on August 4, 1961, and is, therefore, an American citizen by birth.President Obama’s last visit to Kenya was in July 2018, and published media footage and reports of that visit and from previous years contain no information on his declared intention to vie for any political seat in Kenya.Given his status as a prominent figure worldwide, such news would usually be well reported by local and international media. PesaCheck has found no credible news sites that have published this information.Mr Obama’s Twitter timeline, where he has made big announcements in the past, had no trace of any intent to participate in Kenyan politics.Additionally, the site that first published the article is a humour website specialised in posting hoaxes and made-up stories. A disclaimer on the website is pretty clear about that, even though users have to scroll to the bottom of the page to find it.The disclaimer reads,“World News Daily Report assumes however, all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website — even those based on real people — are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.”PesaCheck has looked into the claim that former US President Barack Obama has announced his intention to vie for presidency in Kenya in 2021, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

The post appears to be directed at Mr Odinga and Mr Kyagulanyi and reads: “Losers will always dine together”, before signing off with a hashtag supporting President Yoweri Museveni.However, a Google reverse image search shows that the image was taken when Mr Odinga hosted youth leaders, led by former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga, at his Karen home.

40,Kenya’s First Lady has not called for the BBI to be postponed,"A Facebook post claiming that Kenya’s First Lady, Margaret Kenyatta, has called for the postponement of the constitutional amendment process being undertaken through the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) is FALSE.The post claims Ms Kenyatta has said that the BBI, which is expected to culminate in a referendum on the constitution, should take a back seat to the Big Four Agenda, President Uhuru Kenyatta’s development blueprint for the country.President Kenyatta first outlined the five-year development plan in December 2017. The plan involves four key pillars, including food security, affordable housing, manufacturing and affordable healthcare for all Kenyans.President Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga have been traversing the country drumming up support for the BBI process. The two leaders joined hands to launch the collection of signatures to amend the constitution in November 2020.While the post in question quotes the First Lady verbatim, it does not state when or where Ms Kenyatta made the statement.A statement of this nature by the First Lady, that contradicts the position of President Kenyatta, would have received wide coverage in local media, which is not the case.Additionally, the website of the Office of the First Lady, her Facebook and Twitter pages, which routinely post her activities, have no information on the said statement about the postponement of BBI.In a text response to PesaCheck, State House spokesperson Kanze Dena-Mararo also dismissed the claim as ‘fake news’.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Kenya’s First Lady, Margeret Kenyatta, has called for the postponement of the constitutional amendment process being undertaken through the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
41,This advertisement for jobs at Naivas supermarket is a scam,"A Facebook post claiming that retail chain Naivas supermarket is hiring 400 staff across 22 branches is a HOAX.The post asks users to click on the link provided to check out available job opportunities and submit their applications.However, the link does not direct to the Naivas supermarket website, but to a Google form. The form also indicates that the retailer is recruiting staff in 83 branches across the country, rather than the 22 branches mentioned in the Facebook post.Positions available include cleaners and guards, customer care receptionists, distributors and marketers, cashiers, warehouse supervisors, fleet mechanics, floor attendants and chefs among others. No qualifications or requirements for the jobs or the responsibilities involved are mentioned.Upon completion of the application form, users are instructed to pay a registration fee of KSh 370 using the human resource manager’s (HRM) mobile phone number. The form states that applicants who do not pay the registration fee will not be considered, while those who do not qualify will have their money refunded.While the form indicates that the HRM is Justine Biwott, additional information says that the confirmation message will show the recipient as Enock Cheruiyot, whose affiliation to the retailer is not indicated.However, the transaction message indicates that it is Justine Biwott who has received the money, raising suspicions that the job recruitment is a scam.The Facebook page carrying the claim impersonates the legitimate Facebook page of the retailer. The name of the impostor page is ‘Naivas KENYA’, has 3,231 likes and 3,299 followers. Its profile and the cover image is the supermarket’s logo.On the other hand, the legitimate Facebook page is named ‘Naivas Supermarket’ and has a verified blue check mark. Unlike the impostor page, Naivas’ verified page has 175,345 likes and 207,015 followers, and while its profile image is the retailer’s logo, the cover image is an advertisement about its ‘Back to School’ offers.The ‘About’ tab on the legitimate page also contains contact information, including phone numbers, website address and customer service email address, as well as links to other social media accounts operated by the retailer.There is no information about the recruitment on Naivas supermarket’s website, Facebook or Twitter handles.On January 7, the retailer shared a post on Facebook and Twitter calling the recruitment advert a scam and sharing legitimate contact information that customers should use to get in touch.“Be aware of this fake document passing false information about jobs and stay on high alert,” reads the post in part.The alert adds that the retailer does not recruit any staff via social media and the impostor Facebook page is not the career portal for the parent company Naivas Limited.Another job recruitment advert shared on the same Facebook page has previously been flagged by fact-checkers, including PesaCheck.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that retail chain Naivas supermarket is hiring 400 staff in 22 branches, and finds it to be a HOAX.",HOAX:

Applicants can contact the secretary through the number 0115528650.However, on both accounts, the name of the DP’s spouse has been spelt incorrectly — as Rechael and Rachael — whereas the spelling of her name is Rachel.The post also has punctuation errors that are unlikely to be found on an account of such a prominent personality.Ms Ruto’s official Facebook platform is a page named ‘Mama Rachel Ruto’ and not an account, which was created on June 7, 2013. The page does not contain posts about the Inua Jamii loans or school fees and business loans, nor does the claim appear on Ms Ruto’s Twitter account, where she routinely announces projects she is undertaking.There have been similar hoaxes claiming that Rachel Ruto is offering loans, grants and motorbikes to Kenyans in response to COVID-19, which PesaCheck has debunked in the recent past.The deputy president’s official Facebook page also contains no information about disbursing loans of any kind.PesaCheck has reached out to Dr Ruto and Rachel Ruto’s offices for comment in regard to the claims and will update this article as soon as a response is available.Further, Inua Jamii’s official Facebook page has no information about disbursing school fees nor business loans. Inua Jamii is an official government of Kenya programme run by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection in the State Department for Social Protection, and not by individuals.The ministry, through their Facebook page, has previously cautioned the public that the government programme does not offer loans, but gives cash transfers twice a month to vulnerable citizens categorised as the elderly, persons living with disabilities or orphaned children, and not to businesses.PesaCheck has looked into Facebook posts on accounts using the name and image of the Deputy President William Ruto’s wife, Rachel, claiming to offer soft loans, and finds them to be FALSE.",FALSE:
43,mRNA COVID-19 vaccines will not genetically modify humans,"A Facebook post claiming that any vaccine stored at minus 80 degrees Celsius is not a vaccine but a transfection agent used for genetic manipulation is FALSE.The post reads: “Any vaccine that needs to be shipped and stored at — 80 degrees isn’t a vaccine. It’s a transfection agent, kept alive so it can infect your cells and transfer genetic material.” The post goes on to claim that the vaccine will aid in the “genetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale”.The post appears to be in reference to the recently approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine which needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below. The Moderna vaccine is also stored at frozen temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius, but can also be stored for a month at normal home refrigerator temperatures.Currently, there are three COVID-19 vaccine frontrunners: one manufactured by AstraZeneca, another by Pfizer, and one made by Moderna. The Washington Post reported that AstraZeneca’s vaccine candidate, developed by Oxford University, is up to 90 percent effective in clinical trials. Pfizer and Moderna have reported vaccines that are 95 percent effective.Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines rely on a new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus. Each uses synthetic genetic material that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines.Vaccine Storage Temperature RequirementsEach of the vaccine candidates has different storage temperature requirements.The AstraZeneca vaccine can be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute in many countries.The Moderna vaccine is stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius, but can be kept for a month at normal refrigerator temperatures.The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below. Sanjay Mishra, project coordinator for the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, explains that the vaccine will degrade in five days if kept at regular refrigeration temperatures of slightly above freezing.Dr Mishra goes on to explain that the biggest challenge in developing an mRNA vaccine is “its inherent instability, because it is more likely to break apart above freezing temperatures.”A report by the American Academy of Pediatrics also shows that many vaccines are stored at just above freezing temperatures while some require much colder temperatures. A good example is the Ebola vaccine which is stored at about minus 80 degrees Celsius.Do vaccines cause “genetic manipulation of humans?”The claim that vaccines stored at freezing temperatures are designed for “genetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale” has no basis in fact. As Dr Mishra clarifies, the synthetic genetic material contained in an mRNA vaccine does not mean a patient’s DNA is changed or passed onto their offspring. Instead, the molecule “guides the protein production inside the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few more days.”VerdictPfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate is stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius and below because of the mRNA vaccine’s inherent instability — the very cold temperature slows down the chemical reactions that break apart RNA. Though both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain synthetic genetic material, they do not genetically modify humans receiving them.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming that any vaccine stored at minus 80 degrees Celsius is not a vaccine but a transfection agent used for genetic manipulation and finds that it is FALSE.",FALSE:

Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta is the full name of Kenya’s current president. The status of the account is given as “President at Government of Kenya”.The loans, given through the Inua Jamii project, are aimed at improving the lives of people who are interested in starting or boosting their businesses, and are payable in 18 months, the post says.Interested applicants are requested to inbox their names, identification details and amount required, for immediate consideration.But the post, which lists names of previous ‘beneficiaries’, has obvious punctuation errors that are unlikely to be found on an account of such a prominent personality.Inua Jamii is the name of an official government of Kenya programme. It is run by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection in the State Department for Social Protection, and not by the president.In November 2020, through their Facebook page, the ministry cautioned the public that the government programme does not offer loans, but gives cash transfers twice a month. Eligibility for cash transfers is restricted to vulnerable citizens who fall under three categories: the elderly, persons living with disabilities and orphaned children.Inua Jamii’s official Facebook page provides a link to the ministry’s website, as well as an official .go.ke email address, but no information about disbursing school fees and business loans is contained therein.Additionally, State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena has dismissed the claim made by the post, saying the Office of the President is not giving out the alleged loans nor does the information originate from Mr Kenyatta’s official communication channels.“Any information from Mr Kenyatta’s office is posted via the President’s Delivery Unit and the State House Kenya accounts, which are all official and verified accounts,” she said.“His Excellency does not have a personal social media account.

45,Kenya’s electoral body has not cleared Ferdinand Waititu to run for governor of Nairobi,"A tweet claiming that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has cleared the former governor of Kiambu, Ferdinand Waititu, to run in the Nairobi county gubernatorial election is FALSE.The tweet has also been published by The Brief Kenya.The seat fell vacant after the former Nairobi governor, Mike Sonko, was impeached on charges relating to gross misconduct, violation of the constitution, and abuse of office late last year.On January 4, IEBC gazetted names of persons who have shown interest in contesting the Nairobi gubernatorial seat in party primaries and those intending to contest as independent candidates as required by the law.The IEBC lists 13 independent aspirants — including the former Kiambu governor — and five hopefuls, all of whom are from the Jubilee Party.Screenshot showing the list of independent candidates gazetted by the IEBC.A statement posted on the commission’s official Twitter account on January 6 said that sections 32 and 33 of the Elections Act, 2011 provide that persons intending to contest as independent candidates are required to submit to the symbols they intend to use in an election to the commission.IEBC chair, Wafula Chebukati, said that the commission is, in turn, required to publish the names of those offering themselves for elections and their symbols in the Kenya Gazette.Mr Chebukati, however, stressed that the publication of these names of contestants in party primaries and those intending to contest as independents does not constitute “clearance of candidates to contest in an election.”“Clearance of candidates for purposes of contesting in an election is done during the days set for nomination by the respective returning officers that have been duly appointed by the commission,” Mr Chebukati said.Although Mr Waititu’s name appears on the gazetted list of candidates for the Nairobi governor seat, he is unlikely to be cleared since IEBC has already stated that leaders impeached for abuse of office are not eligible to run for elective posts.Chapter 6, Article 75, 80 and 193 of the constitution states that a person who has been impeached cannot run for an elective position in Kenya.IEBC set February 18 for the Nairobi county by-election following Mr Sonko’s impeachment, but on January 4 the High Court suspended the gazette notice calling for the vote, until a pending court case by the former governor is heard and determined.",FALSE:
46,"Did Nairobi receive KSh 3,600 per capita from county funds for the financial year 2020/2021?","In a tweet posted on October 26, a Twitter user by the name of “Hon. Robert Murathe’’ claims that Nairobi County received KSh 3,600 per person from the county revenue allocations for the financial year 2020/2021.According to the tweet, Nairobi received an allocation of KSh 15.9 billion in 2020/2021, which translates to KSh 3,600 per person.The tweet also says that if the allocation is increased to 35 percent as proposed in the Building Bridges Initiative report, the capital city will receive KSh 24 billion, which will translate to KSh 5,506 per capita.This brings up the question: Is it true that Nairobi County received an allocation of KSh 3,600 per person from county funds?PesaCheck has examined the claim that Nairobi county received an allocation of KSh 3,600 per person from county funds and finds that it is TRUE, based on the following reasons.Kenya’s Commission on Revenue Allocation is mandated to recommend to the National Assembly the basis of equitable sharing of revenues raised nationally. It decides how much revenue will be divided between the national and county governments, and how much each county receives. Currently, 84.5 percent of total revenue is allocated to the national government while 15 per cent is allocated to the counties. The remaining 0.5 percent goes to the Equalization Fund that is designed to provide basic services to marginalised areas.The constitution gives the senate the power to create the regulatory framework for most issues affecting counties, including determination of the level of funding allocated to each county.In this regard, there are three ways in which the Senate determines what funds will be allocated to counties. The first involves a process that the Senate conducts jointly with the National Assembly during the Division of Revenue process through which the amount of money to be allocated to the national government and the county governments is determined. The second stage is exclusive to the Senate and is achieved every year under provisions of The County Allocation of Revenue Act,2013. The Act gives the Senate powers to determine the allocation that will go to each county in a financial year from the total allocation to the counties.Currently, counties share revenue based on five parameters — population (45 per cent), equal share (25 percent), poverty ranking (20 percent), land area (eight per cent) and fiscal responsibility (two per cent).However, the Commission on Revenue Allocation recently proposed a new formula, which links allocation to government function and is also designed to reward efficiency and local revenue generation. It assigns health (17 percent), agriculture (10 percent), urbanisation levels (five percent), road network (four percent), land area (eight percent), poverty ( 14 per cent), fiscal effort (two percent), prudent use of public resources (two percent), all other services (18 percent) and equal share ( 20 percent).The new formula has been passed and was adopted by the Senate in September 2020. It will remain in effect for three years from FY 2021/2022 and will see counties receive KSh 370 billion. The expanded budget includes President Uhuru Kenyatta’s pledge of an additional KSh 53.5 billion over and above the KSh 316.5 billion earlier proposed by the CRA.Under this new arrangement, Nairobi City County will receive KSh 19.2 billion in the next financial year.Nairobi City, with an estimated population of 3,138,369 as per the 2009 census report, received an allocation of KSh 5,033 per capita in 2018/2019 and KSh 5,557 per capita in 2019/2020 respectively as indicated in the table below.In 2020/2021, Nairobi received an allocation of KSh 15.92 billion, the same amount it received in 2019/2020.Calculating the per capita allocation for Nairobi City using the current total revenue allocation and using the 2019 census population figures for the county (4,397,073) gives a per capita allocation of KSh 3,620.This, therefore, brings us to the conclusion that Nairobi City County received a per capita allocation of KSh3,620, making the claim TRUE.",FACT-CHECKED:

They can damage power grids and disrupt satellite communications as well.However on Thursday, November 8, the predicted solar storm on Earth was downgraded from “strong” to “minor” by NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center. As such, auroras are no longer expected in the northern Lower 48 states.A search of NASA’s website likewise found no announcements about an alleged solar storm blocking the sun’s light.While Major General Bolden does, in fact, tell Americans they should have an emergency preparedness plan in the video, at no point does he mention anything about preparing for the Earth to experience six days of darkness. The video, which is several years old, has been shared before in 2011 and 2013, and is therefore unrelated to the article.Further, the Major General is no longer NASA’s administrator, as the article claims, and his biography on the agency’s website shows he held the position from July 2009 until he resigned in January 2017. The current NASA administrator is Jim Bridenstine.The false claim has previously been debunked in 2014 and 2017 .PesaCheck looked into the article with an embedded video claiming NASA announced that the Earth will go dark for six days in December, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

56,This opinion poll showing Raila Odinga leading in popularity is fabricated,"A Facebook post claiming that results from an opinion poll conducted by research and consulting firm Infotrak, show former Prime Minister Raila Odinga leading in popularity among presidential candidates is FAKE.The post contains a screengrab showing the poll results between Mr Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto, per region, including Nyanza, North Eastern, Coast, Rift Valley, Nairobi, Western, Eastern and Nairobi.Both Mr Ruto and Mr Odinga have shown interest in vying for the presidency in the 2022 elections.The results of the alleged poll show that support for Mr Odinga was highest in Nyanza, North Eastern and Coast regions at 91 percent, 72 percent and 75 percent respectively, while Mr Ruto’s score was highest in Rift Valley and Central regions at 75 percent and 58 percent respectively.The poll also claims to show the change in popularity for the two politicians between February and December 2020, with Mr Odinga’s increasing from 48 percent to 65 percent, while the DP’s has dropped from 59 percent to 45 percent. Overall, the poll projects that the former premier would beat DP Ruto if the elections were held during the period under review.The claim was also posted by another Facebook user called Commandare Nyambega Gisesa, and on Twitter by MarthaKuria.However, there is no information about the opinion poll in question on Infotrak’s website, its Facebook or Twitter handles.Responding to queries by PesaCheck by text, Walter Nyabundi, a public policy and governance research manager at Infotrak Research and Consulting, said the organisation has neither conducted nor released any polls on the popularity of presidential aspirants.The company, through its Twitter handle, flagged the opinion poll in question as fake and issued a statement saying it is not in any way responsible for the survey.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that research and consulting firm Infotrak conducted an opinion poll showing former Prime Minister Raila Odinga leading in popularity among presidential candidates, and finds it to be FAKE.",FAKE:
57,This Facebook account donating 20 motorbikes does not belong to Rachel Ruto,"A Facebook post claiming that the deputy president’s wife, Rachel Ruto, is donating 20 motorbikes to the first 20 Kenyans to inbox her on Messenger, is FALSE.Potential applicants are asked to send their full names, ID number and exact location for delivery.Ms Ruto’s official Facebook platform is a page — not a personal account — named Rachel Ruto, which was created on June 7, 2013. The name was changed to Mama Rachel Ruto on December 13, 2020.Further, Ms Ruto’s official Facebook account has links to her other social media platforms, including Instagram and Twitter, while the impostor account does not. This imposter account also carries many other false claims that have been debunked before.All her official social media accounts, where she routinely announces projects she is undertaking, do not contain posts about donating motorbikes.This is not the first time that a Facebook account has made false claims using the name of DP Ruto’s spouse, Rachel.

58,This Facebook page offering loans within 15 minutes is not legitimate,"A Facebook post on an account using the name and image of Deputy President William Ruto’s spouse, Rachel Ruto, and claiming to offer JOYWO loans within 15 minutes, is FALSE.Joyful Women (JOYWO) is a non-profit organisation which provides women with financial resources to engage in livelihood projects through a scheme known as table banking, a concept Ms Ruto introduced to help empower women.To benefit, the post says applicants need their national identification card and should have used M-Pesa for at least two weeks, to qualify for the loans whose minimum is KSh 2,000 while the maximum amount is KSh 200,000.Additionally, applicants are asked to send their names and phone numbers through Facebook Messenger to be considered for the loan.However, the page offering JOYWO loans does not belong to the Second Lady, whose official Facebook platform was created on June 7, 2013, before changing its name on December 13, to Mama Rachel Ruto.While Ms Ruto periodically promotes JOYWO’s activities on her Facebook page, no posts about the online loans mentioned in the claim are contained on her legitimate account.Further, a representative at the organisation, Jane Muthoni, told PesaCheck in a phone interview that JOYWO does not offer loans online.Ms Muthoni added that the organisation, which started in 2009 and is largely membership-based, does not issue loans to individuals, but to women groups.JOYWO has also been a target of scammers, with a number of similar posts alleging to offer loans on social media, claims that both Ms Ruto and the organisation dismissed as fake.PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post on an account using the name and image of Rachel Ruto, wife of Deputy President William Ruto, claiming to offer JOYWO online loans within 15 minutes, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
59,This post advertising UNEP jobs is fake,"A Facebook post claiming that the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is asking job applicants to send CVs to a Gmail account is a HOAX.Prospective applicants over the age of 18 years and who are looking for a chance to work with UNEP “to bring relief to those most affected by poverty in Africa” are asked to send their CVs to a Gmail address — [email protected] — casting doubt about the authenticity of the claim.The United Nations Environment Programme is a United Nations agency responsible for coordinating environmental activities at a global level and supports countries in their efforts to pursue environmentally sound policies and practices.However, all job openings with the UN are published on the United Nations Careers Portal. To apply, a candidate has to submit an application through the UN online recruitment system. UNEP job openings may also be posted on the UNEP website.“Definitely fake. All UNEP vacancies are advertised on the official UN careers portal: careers.un.org,” Keishamaza Rukikaire, UNEP head of news and media, told PesaCheck in an interview.Further, to apply for jobs at the UN, candidates fill out an online application available on the online portal; the process does not entail submitting CVs through a Gmail address as claimed in the post.Recently, PesaCheck also debunked a similar post from the same Facebook account, promoting non-existent jobs openings at World Vision.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to advertise jobs at UNEP and finds it to be FALSE.",HOAX:
60,Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline does not own the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China,"A claim that pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline owns the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China is FALSE.A few days after news broke that the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19 was being prepared for distribution, a rumor started circulating on social media in Kenya and across the world that GlaxoSmithKline owned a laboratory in China at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where conspiracy theorists allege the virus originated.The rumor attempts to trace a line from GlaxoSmithKline to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, to the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, to billionaire philanthropist George Soros, and to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.Here’s the version of the rumor that was posted on Facebook in Kenya:Research by PesaCheck shows that the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline does not own the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The Wuhan Institute of Virology, a research lab in China, is operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and is funded, in large part, by the Chinese government. It is not owned by GlaxoSmithKline as the post claims.It’s also false to say that GlaxoSmithKline owns the pharmaceutical company, Pfizer.While these two companies share some common interests — in 2018, they announced a joint venture that combined their consumer health businesses — they remain two distinct companies. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that:“Pfizer Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC plan to combine their consumer health-care units and eventually spin off the joint venture, creating the world’s largest seller of drugstore staples like Advil and Sensodyne toothpaste.”From the above information, it is clear that the joint venture does not involve one company buying out the other.The rumor appears to have been created with the intent of stirring up confusion and skepticism over the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine by connecting the pharmaceutical companies to the Wuhan laboratory. GlaxoSmithKline, however, does not own the Wuhan Institute of Virology.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline owns the Wuhan Institute of Virology and finds it to be FALSE.",HOAX:
61,The High Court has not stopped Kenya’s electoral body from verifying signatures for a constitutional amendment,"A Facebook post claiming that the High Court has stopped the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) from verifying signatures collected for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) process is FALSE.The collection of signatures followed the launch of the BBI constitutional amendment bill as well as a nationwide exercise to collect signatures in its support by President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) in Nairobi on November 25, 2020.According to Article 157 of the Constitution of Kenya, at least one million signatures of registered voters are required to begin the amendment process expected to culminate into a referendum.The week-long signature collection exercise ended on December 4, 2020, with Mr Odinga claiming that over five million Kenyans have appended signatures endorsing the BBI process.However, the process has been faced by a number of legal challenges including one where a voter sought to have the High Court stop the signature verification process pending determination of a case on yet to be registered voters in the diaspora.On December 9, the High court allowed the case on diaspora voters to continue but declined to issue orders to stop the verification process, contrary to what the Facebook post in question claims.On December 10, 2020, the electoral body received the draft bill for a constitutional amendment through a popular initiative along with supporting signatures from the BBI secretariat led by its co-chair, Junet Mohammed.IEBC also said it shall begin the process of verifying that the initiative is supported by one million registered voters as required by the law.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the High Court has stopped the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) from verifying signatures collected for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) process, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
62,CNN did not broadcast these remarks by Raila Odinga,"This post claiming CNN quoted remarks by Kenya’s former Premier, Raila Odinga, on the threat of a doctors’ strike is FAKE.The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMDU) issued a strike notice on Monday, December 7. The Union cites poor working conditions and says unless the government meets their demands for provision of COVID Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), among other welfare issues, the strike will proceed.So far, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that Kenya has recorded 88,579 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 1,531 deaths. Of the deceased, 13 were doctors, 26 nurses and nine clinical officers attending to COVID-19 patients.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that healthcare personnel be provided with PPE as a Standard and Transmission-based precaution when caring for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.However, Kenyan medics have raised concerns over their safety due to inadequate supplies of PPE in handling COVID-19 patients. This propelled them to threaten the industrial action that has since been suspended to allow for dialogue with the government.It is in response to the strike threats that Mr Odinga addressed healthcare workers while in Kisumu County, urging them to be “understanding”. Local media quotes him as saying, “It’s not only doctors who are dying… we are also in a hard position economically… this is not the time to hold the government at ransom,” remarks that sparked mixed reactions on several social media platforms.The post on Facebook suggests that the former PM’s statement caught CNN’s attention and backs the claim using a doctored screengrab.However, a Google reverse search of the image reveals it has been used severally for memes, created using various meme generator apps. Also, the CNN logo used in the ticker — text on the lower third of the screen seen in the image is not the broadcaster’s official logo.A look at CNN’s website, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, where the broadcaster publishes breaking news content, reveals no such news has been reported.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that CNN broadcasted remarks allegedly made by Kenya’s former Premier, Raila Odinga, castigating doctors over an impending strike, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

64,This video alleging traceable microchips will be injected with the COVID-19 vaccine is doctored and used out of context,"A video shared on Facebook claiming that the COVID-19 vaccine will contain a tracking microchip that will be injected into individuals is ALTERED.The video starts with a commentary from Bill Gates, who speaks on developments such as moving away from cash operations to a digital system. Mr Gates goes on to describe advances in the health field, saying, “…innovations like vaccines, we need a measuring system that tracks the vaccine…:”But the video has been edited to create a misleading combination from two parts of his speech during the Alliance for Financial Inclusion’s 2013 Global Policy Forum (GPF), held in September that year.The original video shows that Mr Gates referred to vaccines as an example of the breakthrough innovations that have changed the future for billions of people. Later, he talks about a ‘measurement system’, but in reference to the need for a system that tracks progress and ensures participants benefit from financial inclusion, and not vaccines. The two points in the original video are cut and put together, hence altering the meaning.The video also includes footage from the launch of a United Nations report on digital cooperation in 2019, which appears at timestamp 1:33. The panel at the launch included Mr Gates’ wife, Melinda, and Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.While the video includes authentic commentary from Ms Gates and the business mogul, when paired up within news reports of microchips, these remarks become sinister. In the altered video, the co-chair of the Gates Foundation notes that technology gives incredible opportunities to create “the world that we want”. But the full footage shows Ms Gates was referring to the use of technology to ensure a “more just and humane world”.About seven minutes into the talk, the moderator asks Mr Ma to explain how digital technology can help in doing business, to which he responds saying the most important element is in helping women, small businesses and developing countries harness resources to reach more people. Nothing in the businessman’s remarks mentions vaccines.The doctored video includes other clips from old news reports about the microchip technology in humans, that are unrelated to the COVID-19 vaccine.At minute 3:00, it includes footage from an authentic PBS NewsHour show, but the comment by anchor Judy Woodruff, is edited and the words are selectively cropped to make it appear she said people who support the implantation of microchips do it to “take back control.” However, while the original footage shows the broadcast indeed covered the use of human microchips, Ms Woodruff’s sentence made reference to those who are in favour of the practice, who feel it enables them “take back control of their personal data.”Therefore, investigations by PesaCheck reveal the clips are taken from different events and years and combined together into one video to mislead audiences.PesaCheck has looked into the video shared on Facebook claiming that the COVID-19 vaccine will contain a tracking microchip that will be injected into individuals at the time of vaccination, and finds it to be ALTERED.",ALTERED:

They include Credit Reference Bureau Africa Limited (trading as TransUnion), Metropol Credit Reference Bureau Limited and Creditinfo Credit Reference Bureau Kenya Limited.PesaCheck found other Facebook accounts making similar claims including Too Florah and Alex K Nation. The latter, which has since been deleted after investigations by PesaCheck, bore the branding of Creditinfo CRB Kenya limited and claimed to offer clearance and certificates on behalf of the credit bureau.However, in a Facebook post on November 30, Creditinfo distanced itself from the account, denying any association with it.The Facebook account also made several other claims including one that it is a verified clearance officer at the National Bank of Kenya (NBK).But NBK, through their public relations firm, Oxygen, told PesaCheck that the Facebook account is fake and has been flagged as such on the bank’s Facebook page on December 2, 2020.Moreover, none of the procedures outlined by the Facebook accounts in question presents the correct process to follow in order to get cleared from a CRB listing.A clearance certificate is a document that proves your credit status is good and that all your outstanding debts, if any, have been settled or are in good standing.The claim by all these Facebook accounts that they can provide a clearance certificate to people without them having to settle their outstanding debts therefore, has no basis.Additionally, the websites of the three recognised credit reference bureaus contain procedures for obtaining a clearance certificate — none of which includes contacting a personal phone number as claimed.Creditinfo’s procedure, for example, requires users to complete an application form on the bureau’s website.Even after clearing outstanding loans, section 33. (1) of the CRB Regulations 2013 says that a Bureau shall retain customer information on non-performing loans until the expiry of five years from the date of final settlement of the amount in default including settlement of the amounts payable.PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook account claiming to offer Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) clearance and certificates, and finds it to be a HOAX.",HOAX:

The four are standing outside what looks like a government building — painted with the colours of the Kenyan flag.The post explains that the man in handcuffs is Peter Langat, a police officer in Bomet county, who interrupted a signature collection exercise in Lelekwet village.Mr Langat allegedly asked the area assistant chief for permission to sign the signature book, but instead tore it to pieces and threw it into a river. The post then asks users whether Mr Langat should be celebrated or arrested.It is true that a police officer named Peter Langat from Bomet county indeed tore the BBI signature collection book, an incident that was reported on various news outlets including K24 and the Daily Nation.The assistant chief of Kipseres sub-location in Bomet East, Robert Katam, confirmed to PesaCheck that the incident took place in his area on December 2, 2020.“The police officer has since been apprehended, taken to Longisa police station, and later arraigned, then freed on bond,” Mr Katam said.However, the administrator said the image in the post does not show Constable Langat as claimed.A Google reverse image search brings up an article by the Daily Nation dated August 12, 2019, with the same image alongside it. The caption identifies the man in handcuffs as an Officer Commanding Station (OCS), chief inspector Shadrack Mumo, attached to the Kizingitini police station in Lamu county on the coast of Kenya.The story reports that chief inspector Mumo was arrested in connection with the release of a drug trafficker and his consignment of drugs under unclear circumstances from the station where the inspector worked.Another article by Kenyans.co.ke uses the same image and confirms the name of the officer as chief inspector Mumo with a second image of him facing the camera while handcuffed. In both articles, a sign on the door of the building in the photo reads ‘Lamu Central Sub-county CIPU Commander’.

One of the occupants of a passing car has their hands out of the window in what appears to be an attempt to photograph the demonstrators.The post accompanying the image states that the students from Lugulu Girls took to the streets to demand that the BBI be stopped immediately.Lugulu Girls High school is a secondary education institution in Webuye town of Bungoma county, in the western region of Kenya.However, a Google reverse image search brings up the image in question contained in a Twitter thread by journalist Michael Murumba, who places the scene of the demonstration by the students as along the Webuye — Kitale highway.But Mr Murumba in his tweet says the students protested after their school principal threatened students who witnessed a rape incident within the school. The thread also contains a video of the students airing their grievances to the Webuye OCS.A further internet search brings up various news reports that corroborate the explanation by Mr Murumba’s Twitter thread.

Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has also been successfully isolated from urine and from ocular secretions, contrary to the claim made in the post.After the virus was identified by Chinese authorities on January 7, 2020, its genetic material (RNA) was sequenced. Sequencing is a process through which researchers get to better understand the genetic make-up of a virus so as to determine how infection progresses and then use this information to develop better vaccines and treatments.The sequence contains instructions for creating the virus’s proteins, which then formed the basis for developing the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines.Since being identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to more than 68 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and over 1.5 million deaths as of December 8.PesaCheck looked into a Twitter post with an image that claims scientists have not isolated the COVID-19 virus, so a vaccine is not possible and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

The post may have been referring to Difatha, a settlement in Kirinyaga county, which is some 120 kilometers from Nairobi.The post further alleges that the youth fell unconscious after consuming vast amounts of the free beer and that police later arrived at the scene.However, a Google reverse image search shows that the incident did not take place in Difatha as claimed in the post.Among the search results is an article published in October 2019, by the Nairobi News, which runs alongside the same image. The article reports that the incident took place in Roysambu, a constituency within Nairobi county. Roysambu is about 100 kilometres away from Difatha.Roysambu residents reportedly flooded the site and made away with beer, before police intervened, lobbing teargas to disperse the looters.Apart from the image in the post, the article also carries other photos from the accident scene and, although no captions are provided, a video showing the scramble for the beer has also been published alongside the pictures.PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image claiming to show youth looting beer from an overturned truck in Difatha along the Nairobi-Embu highway, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
75,The damaged car in this image does not belong to Kenyan politician Raila Odinga,"A Facebook post with an image claiming to show a vehicle belonging to former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, and alleging it was damaged in Siaya county, Kenya is FALSE.The image shows a close-up of what appears to be a tyre blowout while the post accompanying the photo claims Mr Odinga’s car was “badly involved in an accident in Siaya” during a BBI campaign tour.But the claim in the post, published on December 1, has not been covered by any local media outlets, raising red flags that it may be false. As a high profile political figure in Kenya, any accident involving Mr Odinga’s car would have been widely covered by the media.An internet search brings up a similar image that was tweeted by the Daily Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper. The tweet indicates that the vehicle in the picture belongs to National Unity Platform (NUP) party’s presidential candidate, Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine.The damage is said to have occurred when police allegedly shot at Mr Kyagulanyi’s car as he campaigned in the southeastern region of Jinja, Uganda, on December 1, 2020.The post includes other images which were also tweeted by Mr Kyagulanyi showing the full car and damages to other parts of the vehicle as well.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with an image claiming to show former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s damaged car in Siaya county, Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

Pole babu (sorry granddad)”.However, the post, which was shared on December 3, 2020, does not indicate when the alleged incident took place.On the day the post in question was shared, Mr Odinga, who routinely updates the public about his political activities on social media, did not publish any information about the alleged tour to Bungoma.Instead, he posted a photo of himself meeting with a member of parliament for Malava constituency, Malulu Injendi, and the governor of Kakamega County, Wycliffe Oparanya, at Orange House in Nairobi.A Google reverse image search shows that several articles from April 2016, previously used the same image, including Business Today. The gist of all these articles is that the former PM was trying to get away from the cloud of teargas lobbed at him and his supporters by anti-riot police.At the time the photo was taken, Mr Odinga represented the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) and participated in protests against the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).A further internet search brings up the same image published alongside an article by The Star, this time with a caption that shows the protest took place outside the IEBC offices at Anniversary Towers in Nairobi on April 25, 2016.PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post with an image claiming to show former Prime Minister Raila Odinga being roughed up in Bungoma in a bid to force him to denounce the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

However, the reward is yet to be credited. Respondents are asked to “activate free internet” by sharing a message of their win to 20 friends or three groups via a WhatsApp button on the page, failure to which they will not receive the prize.The site appears to be clickbait whose primary intent is to reach shared contacts virally through WhatsApp. While there is no evidence of malware, such links from suspicious websites have been used to compromise privacy and damage computers or phones used for accessing the links.The website does not show any linkage to an internet service provider or telecommunications network, which raises questions about its authenticity.Additionally, the link does not direct to the legitimate Safaricom website, whose domain name is safaricom.co.ke.

88,Kenya’s deputy president did not escape a recent assassination attempt. There was none,"An article published by KenyaFlash claiming that Deputy President William Ruto has escaped an assassination attempt is FALSE.The article says the DP was on his way to a meeting in Westlands when unknown assailants fired at his car, prompting his security to fight them off.The article, which was published on November 12, 2020, however, has a number of discrepancies, including the fact that it does not indicate the date when the incident took place. It only states that the said shoot out took place at 7:49 pm.Additionally, while the headline claims that DP Ruto’s car was attacked at around ‘statehouse road’ (sic), the article itself says the incident took place in Nairobi’s central business district.Curiously, the article makes reference to an unnamed clergyman who did not sustain any injuries from the alleged exchange of fire.The article adds that detectives were investigating to find out the motive of the alleged assassination attempt, with the Central Officer Commanding Police Divisions (OCPD) demanding the DP’s security be doubled. However, the position of OCPD was scrapped back in 2018, when, as part of reforms, police posts and patrol bases were integrated into stations, under the command of Officer Commanding Police Station (OCS).Speaking to PesaCheck over the phone, Police spokesman Charles Owino dismissed the claim as a hoax.“The Central (Officer Commanding Station) OCS has no jurisdiction to make a decision about the DP’s security team, just as the OCS Karen cannot do the same at the DP’s Karen home,” Mr Owino said.“The DP’s security escort is derived from the Presidential Escort Unit, which makes it very unlikely that an OCS would make such a request.”Dr Ruto himself has also made no mention of the alleged attempt on his life via his official Facebook or Twitter accounts, and his recent posts all revolve around events he has attended, the BBI and messages of condolences.The director of communication in the office of the deputy president, Mr Emmanuel Talam, told PesaCheck via phone that the claim is not true. “There is nothing like that,” Mr Talam said.Moreover, none of the sources mentioned in the article in question is quoted verbatim, raising red flags on the authenticity of the claims made therein.Given the prominence of the DP in Kenyan politics, the alleged incident would have been covered by the local mainstream media outlets and publication, which is not the case.In 2019, an alleged plot to assassinate Dr Ruto received wide coverage in various local mainstream media outlets, but the claims were dismissed by the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Interior, Karanja Kibicho.The text in the last three paragraphs of the story has been plagiarized from an article published by The Star on May 21, 2020, about an alleged scheme by state operatives to weaken key state agencies and independent constitutional commissions, and have nothing to do with an assassination attempt as claimed in the post.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that there was a recent attempt on the life of Deputy President William Ruto in Nairobi, and finds it to be a FALSE.",FALSE:

Additionally, information about who owns the domain name is hidden.On the other hand, the WHOIS information of the legitimate Safaricom page shows it was registered on December 2, 2003, and owned by Safaricom PLC. There is also additional information about the company’s physical and postal address.Responding to a query from a Twitter user about the promotion, Safaricom distanced itself, saying the ad is not legitimate, and warned users to be wary of such fraudulent posts.PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook post promoting Black Friday giveaways by telecom firm Safaricom, and finds it to be a HOAX.",HOAX:

Supporters of Kibaki’s opponent, Raila Odinga of the Orange Democratic Movement, alleged electoral manipulation.PesaCheck researched the claim and found that the DCI does not intend to investigate 2007/08 the PEV afresh. Instead, on November 23, DCI Kinoti said detectives are looking into new threats targeted towards some of the election violence victims.The fresh investigations are being conducted following complaints by several communities that they are being profiled and intimidated amid rising political temperatures in the country, the DCI added.Those who have lodged complaints and say they fear for their lives include past victims of the 2007–08 PEV — the worst electoral chaos in Kenya that left more than 1,100 people killed and displaced more than half a million people from their homes.DCI Kinoti further said that 118 cases have been recorded, including 72 by people whose relatives were killed in the PEV, and who are still receiving threats.The investigations director was speaking at the DCI headquarters along Kiambu Road, where he addressed several victims of the 2007/08 PEV who recorded statements.On November 24, the DCI released an official statement to clarify the misconception that the agency intends to open fresh investigations on the 2007/08 PEV.In his statement, Mr Kinoti explained that his address on November 23, did not mean that the DCI is “going to open completed cases that were investigated and closed”.“It was an acknowledgement of concerns raised by Kenyans, to assure the public of the commitment of the DCI to investigate all reported threats to security and to sensitize the public on the need for peaceful coexistence.”",MISSING

Instructions indicate that notification of the status of a loan application will be given within 15 minutes and if the loan is approved, the loanee will receive cash within 10 minutes.Clicking the ‘next’ button on the Google form opens a new page with the registration procedure requiring all first-time applicants to pay a fee of KSh 250 in order to be considered for the loans.The explanation on the form says the fee is used to confirm the credit history of prospective borrowers in order to determine their loan limit. If an applicant does not qualify for a loan, the form adds, the fee is refunded, whereas if it is approved, it will be included in their loan repayments.Under the instructions is an application form requiring prospective borrowers to fill out personal information such as name, National Identification Number and telephone number, purpose of the loan and whether or not they have outstanding loans.The next page shows the loan limit the user qualifies to receive. A paybill number is listed through which they can pay the activation fee and key in transaction details in order to complete the application process.Despite the requirement for prospective borrowers to be subscribers of either Safaricom or Airtel mobile money transfer services, the Google form only provides an M-Pesa paybill number to process the activation fee.Additionally, the M-Pesa paybill number provided, 4026691, is registered under the name ‘ARCADE PREMIERE 1’, and not the name of the organisation — Waraka LoansKE.Further, while the name of the company issuing the loan facility is Waraka LoansKE, a search on the eCitizen portal did not bring up any results, raising red flags that the company could be fictitious and out to con unsuspecting borrowers out of their money.Responding to PesaCheck via email, Kevin Mutiso, the chief executive officer of the Digital Lenders Association of Kenya, said all its members are listed on its website.

There is also no mention of an application fee being required in order to be considered for employment.In 2019, Carrefour issued a warning to job applicants not to fall prey to fraudulent recruitment processes, adding that it never charges candidates any application fee and that it only works with two accredited agencies, namely Flexi Personnel and Engin Solutions Limited for its recruitment services.PesaCheck has looked into the Google form claiming to advertise job opportunities with the retailer, Carrefour, and finds it to be a HOAX.",HOAX:

120,This Facebook page advertising jobs at Coca-Cola bottling company is not legitimate,"A Facebook page with a poster advertising jobs at Coca-cola bottling company is FAKE.The poster says the company is looking for employees to fill 120 vacant positions at new branches countrywide. The minimum qualification for the positions is a secondary school level of education.The post directs interested candidates to fill out the application form on what it claims is an official website.However, the website says the company aims to employ 2,500 employees, including interns, and not just the 120 number stated on the Facebook post.The job opportunities advertised include cleaners and guards, motorbike riders, technicians, receptionists and secretaries, storekeepers and cooks, drivers, messengers, and accountants as well as distributors and marketers.The claim is that the company will pay new employees a salary of KSh 21,500 and above, adding that the recruitment process aims to replace employees whose contracts have ended.The application form requires applicants to provide their personal information, a cover letter and to upload their resume. Curiously, the requirement for the cover letter and resume is not marked with a red asterisk, indicating that it is not mandatory.The website itself sits on the domain cocacolabottlerscompany.com, which is not the legitimate website of the Coca-Cola bottling partner in Kenya — Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA). There is no information about the vacancies being promoted on the legitimate website.A WHOIS search of the domain name of the impostor website reveals that it was registered on September 3, 2020, in Panama and information about the organisation which owns it is hidden. This suggests that the bogus application procedure is part of an elaborate phishing scam using fraudulent means to collect applicants’ personal information.On the other hand, a WHOIS search of the legitimate CCBA website shows that it was registered on June 4, 2015, and it is owned by Coca-Cola Beverages Africa.The Facebook page with the jobs advert has the username Coca-Cola Bottlers KE.

122,The claim that bars and clubs are set to close as Kenya goes into lockdown again is misleading,"A tweet claiming that bars and clubs are set to close as Kenya goes into lockdown again is FALSE.The tweet from BBC News Africa teases a number of stories contained in a podcast dubbed ‘Africa Today’, including Ethiopia’s prime minister’s declaration of a state of emergency in the Tigray region and striker Asamoah Gyan’s story on joining league football in Ghana.The podcast also features a story by the BBC’s Immanuel Igunza looking into how Kenya is experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 infections and reports that President Uhuru Kenyatta has summoned county governors to address the rise in cases.Mr Igunza speculates that new restrictions could be put in place across the country in response to the resurgence of cases, including the shutdown of bars and entertainment venues, as well as a ban on political rallies.However, neither the introduction to the story nor the tweet qualifies the report by Mr Igunza as speculative, instead presenting the closure of bars and clubs and the eventuality of a lockdown in Kenya as factual.The introduction claims that bars, clubs and pubs across Kenya are set to be shut down again under new COVID-19 lockdown measures in the wake of rising cases while the tweet adds to this by claiming that the country is going into lockdown again.The tweet, which was shared hours after President Kenyatta announced new COVID-19 restrictions, was met with incredulity by some Facebook users who commented and called out the BBC for sharing false information.The fresh restrictions include the suspension of political rallies as speculated on by Mr Igunza’s report, but stop short of a second lockdown and the total closure of bars as suggested in the tweet.The government of Kenya has instead brought forward the curfew period by one hour, running from 10 pm to 4 am instead of the 11 pm to 4 am curfew that was in place in September. Bars and restaurants are now required to close by 9 pm, reducing their operating hours by an hour from the initial 10 pm closing time when the lockdown was lifted in September.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that bars and clubs are set to close as Kenya goes into lockdown again, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

Its display image is a photograph of the governor wearing a black hoodie and a pair of cream chino pants while the cover image is an infographic listing his development priorities for Makueni during his second term in office. Under the ‘About’ tab there is a link to the county government of Makueni’s website. The page has over 138, 000 followers and Facebook page transparency information shows that it was created on October 14, 2014.On the other hand, the username of the impostor Facebook account is ‘GOVERNOR MAKUENI COUNTY’, its display image is a photo of Prof Kibwana wearing a checked shirt and the cover image is a group photo of the governor and his counterparts from other counties. Because it is not a public figure page, the account has no Facebook page transparency information.On November 3, 2020 Prof Kibwana posted a screenshot of the Facebook account in question and warned members of the public to be aware of such fakes.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook account using the name and images of Makueni County Governor Kivutha Kibwana, and finds it to be FALSE.",FAKE:

Attendees are promised an allowance of KSh 20,000 and anyone interested is asked to contact the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lang’ata constituency, Nixon Korir and his Dagoretti South counterpart, John Kiarie, through numbers provided.The post above the flier appears to throw a jibe at the DP for his position over the BBI report, saying the ‘train’ has already left for a progressive future of Kenya. “The main agenda for some individuals is to derail Kenya from prosperity and a more united Kenya,” reads the post.During the recent launch of the BBI report at the Bomas of Kenya, Dr Ruto faulted a number of the proposals contained in it and asked proponents of the report to persuade him, and millions of Kenyans he claimed to represent, otherwise.“We must strive progressively to have a negotiated constitutional settlement or to arrive at a place where we are all working together building consensus,” he said at the event.The DP took issue with the proposal to have an ombudsman appointed by the executive to the judiciary, which he termed as a derogation from the independence of the judiciary.The Facebook group where the poster was shared — Every Hustle Matters — describes itself as the official team organising and campaigning for Dr Ruto’s presidential bid.However, responding to a query by PesaCheck, Emmanuel Talam, the director of communication in the deputy president’s office, disowned the poster and termed the claim as “nonsense”.Lang’ata MP Mr Nixon Korir, whose contact is listed in the poster in question, also dismissed the poster as a fabrication.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a poster promoting a youth consultative meeting on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) to be hosted by deputy president, William Ruto, and finds it to be FAKE.",FAKE:

135,70% of Kenyans Christians?,"A post shared on Facebook claims that 70 percent of Kenyans are Christians and yet the country is also ranked as one of the most corrupt nations in the world.Kenya is predominantly a religious nation, with a majority of the population adhering to one of the existing faith sects. Religion can influence human behaviour and decisions, and the teachings of Christianity and Islam alike discourage vices such as coercion, bribery and embezzlement, which are considered corrupt practices.Two claims emerge from this post; that Kenya has a Christain population of 70 percent, and that the nation is ranked among the most corrupt in the world.Claim 1: Is 70 percent of the Kenyan population Christians as the post claims?Broadly categorised, the main religious groupings to which Kenyans are affiliated include Christianity, Islam, Hindu and traditional religions.Each of these religions is further divided into independent branches. Christianity, for instance, has several denominations including Protestant, Catholic and Evangelical congregations.Christianity, one of the major religions, is based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ of Nazareth and is considered the most widespread of all faiths worldwide, with a following of over two billion people.Christianity was introduced in the country when missionaries settled near Mombasa in 1844. In the early 20th century, many Kenyans left mission churches to start their own — African Independent churches, free from the control of the missionaries especially in Central Kenya.The 2019 census report by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows that 85.5 percent of the Kenyan population are professed Christians.Protestants are the majority with 15,777,473 followers (33.4 percent), followed by Catholics with 9,726,129 followers (20.6 percent), while another 9,648,680 people (20.4 percent) attend evangelical churches. About 3,292,573 go to African Instituted Churches, Orthodox (201,263) and other Christian-based sects account for 1,732,911 adherents.Islam has a following of 5,152,194 (11 percent), while Hindu has 60,287. About 318,727 Kenyans are traditionalists.While Christianity’s numbers diminished from its centre in Europe, the faith has continued to grow in Africa. In Kenya, for instance, the religion formed 53 percent of the population in 1962, which has grown to over 80 percent after independence.Data from the Pew Research Centre’s Religion and Public Life Project largely agrees with the KNBS 2019 census figures, recording Christianity at 84.8 percent in the country in 2010.Muslims accounted for 9.7 percent of the population, 2.5 percent were unaffiliated and 1.7 percent tended toward traditional or folk religion. Other religions made up 1.2 percent of the population, while Hindus, Budhists and Jews all recorded less than one percent each.All the above information sources show that Kenya’s Christian population is more than the 70 percent stated in the post.Therefore, the claim that 70 percent of Kenyans are Christians is FALSE.Claim 2: Does Kenya rank as one of the most corrupt countries in the world?The UNDP defines corruption as the misuse of entrusted power for private gain. Countries where religion plays a significant role are assumed to be more likely to have citizens who develop an ethical framework based on their faith.Since fairness and honesty form the basis of many religions, it is expected that faithful adherents to religion will refrain from corruption.Corruption in post-colonial Kenya has a history that spans multiple eras; from the regime of the founding President Jomo Kenyatta, though those of the second President Daniel Arap Moi and the third President Mwai Kibaki’s government to the present.Institutions designed to serve citizens and to regulate their relationship with the State, are instead used for the personal enrichment of public officials including politicians, bureaucrats and corrupt private individuals, groups, and businesses affiliated to them.Transparency International (TI), the World Bank and the PRS Group are some of the institutions that measure corruption in Kenya.According to TI, corruption persists in Kenya primarily because there are people in high places who benefit from it and the governance institutions lack both the will and capacity to stop them from doing so.The 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index by TI ranks Kenya at position 137 out of 180 countries. In a press statement released on January 23 this year, TI — Kenya said:“Kenya has obtained a score of 28 out of 100 in the global Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) released by Transparency International today, a score which is below the global average score of 43 and the sub-Saharan average score of 32,” revealed the TI report.A score of zero means highly corrupt and 100 is “very clean”.Since 2012, Kenya has scored between 25 and 28, out of 100, having recorded a score of 27 in 2018, depicting slow progress in the fight against corruption.The World Bank’s 2015 to 2019 rating showed prevalence of corruption in Kenya stood consistently at three — on a scale of one to six — where one represents low and six represents high. Among countries with the highest prevalence of corruption — only three of the 114 — scored 4.5.Kenya was among 56 countries out of 114 that scored three and above in a 2015 World Bank report. The report indicates that a score of 3.0 and above represents a high prevalence of corruption.Kenya’s 2019 score of 28 out of 100 in the TI’s CPI, a result that represents a fall below both the global average score and sub-Saharan Africa’s average score shows that it is ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world at position 137 out of 180 countries.In conclusion, the claim that 70 percent of Kenyans are Christians is FALSE, while the claim that Kenya ranks among the most corrupt countries in the world is TRUE.",Are
136,the Kenyan economy grow by 4.6% in the first quarter of 2020?,"In his 11th COVID-19 address to the nation on August 26, President Uhuru Kenyatta claimed that Kenya’s economy has grown by 4.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared to 5.5 percent in the same period in 2019, despite disruptions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.The president said that the current economic indicators, despite being lower, are better than what had been anticipated. In April, after Kenya reported its first COVID-19 case, the Treasury lowered the country’s economic growth projection to 2.5 percent for 2020.The World Bank followed the cue, reducing the projected growth rate to 1.5 percent. However, later reports indicate that the lending arm of the World Bank has since revised projections for Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) upwards to 2.5 percent, due to improved agricultural exports.This brings up the question: Is it true that Kenya’s economy grew by 4.6 percent during the first quarter of 2020?PesaCheck has examined the claim that Kenya’s economy grew by 4.6 percent during the first quarter of 2020 and found that it is MOSTLY TRUE, based on the following reasons:Economic growth in Kenya, as in other countries, is calculated as the percentage change in GDP from one year to the next.COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures that have been in place in the country since March this year have not only disrupted livelihoods but to a greater extent led to a reduction in government revenue.The Kenyan government took swift action to deal with the health and economic impact of COVID-19, including instituting a partial lockdown, enforcing social distancing measures to curb the spread, increasing the capacity of health care facilities and providing financial stimulus and support packages for both individuals and businesses. These measures are expected to slow down the country’s economic growth.Kenya was recently ranked the third-largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) estimates. Before the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Kenya’s economy had already recorded deceleration. The real GDP growth in 2019 was about 5.4 percent, compared to 6.3 percent in 2018.Coupled with the convergence of several calamities, including the locust invasion at the beginning of the year that looms over agricultural productivity and food security, the COVID-19 pandemic and recent floods, the economy has been hit hard.Despite these impacts, the quarterly gross domestic report released by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics on June 30, shows that Kenya’s economy remained resilient in the first quarter of 2020, recording 4.9 percent, compared to a growth of 5.5 percent in the same quarter in 2019.On October 15, KNBS also released the projections of the second quarter growth showing that Kenya’s GDP shrunk by 5.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with growth of 4.9 percent in the three months through March and expansion of 5.3 percent in the same period in 2019.The negative growth occurred as a result of the lockdown measures put in place by President Kenyatta in a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19. However, the president eased the lockdown measures and partially opened the economy on July 6, after four months of restrictions and based on IMF’s projections, it is expected that the country’s ailing economy will not shrink by as much as was previously projected.Kenya’s economy grew by 4.9 percent and not 4.6 percent as stated by President Kenyatta. This makes the claim that the economy grew by a GDP of 4.6 during the first quarter of 2020 MOSTLY TRUE.",Did
137,many Kenyans are employed formally in the agricultural sector?,"Layoffs are mounting in almost every sector of Kenya’s economy that has been devastated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The outlook remains uncertain with the World Health Organization saying that basic public health and disease control are the only tools available to tame the coronavirus pandemic until a vaccine is developed or a cure is found.On May 12, 2020, the Daily Nation newspaper reported that the pandemic had so far claimed 30,000 formal jobs in Kenya’s manufacturing sector.The same article said nearly 294,000 people are formally employed in the agriculture sector, with a further 3.4 million employed informally. Presenting a dismal outlook for the sector, the report added that about 40 percent of agricultural workers are likely to lose their jobs as COVID-19 continues to wipe out employment gains in nearly every industry.Many other industries that rely on agriculture, directly and indirectly, are likely to feel the pinch and shed staff.So, the question is, how true is the claim that the agriculture sector employs 294,000 formally?PesaCheck has examined the claim that the agriculture sector employs 294,000 people formally and finds the claim to be MOSTLY TRUE on the following grounds:Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) Economic Survey 2020 classifies employment in Kenya under three categories; formal (modern), informal and small scale agriculture and pastoralist activities. Agriculture, forestry and fishing are grouped into one industry, implying employment numbers are consolidated as one unit. Last year, private sector industries dealing with agriculture, forestry and fishing employed 296,700 people, an increase of 0.8 percent from 294,300 in 2018. In addition, 41,900 people working on agriculture, forestry and fishing were employed in the public sector, compared to 42,300 workers in 2018.According to the World Bank, agriculture plays a crucial role in poverty reduction in Kenya. The sector offers employment to a majority of Kenyans, especially in rural areas, where access to land for farming is the main resource available for productivity. The Food and Agriculture Organization considers the sector a core contributor to the rural economy.Between 2015 and 2019, waged, private sector employment for agriculture, forestry and fishing industries consistently increased, with the exception of 2017 when a decline was noted. In the public sector, waged employment has been in slow recess.In essence, data from KNBS and the World Bank supports the view that agriculture is a major source of employment in Kenyans. However, relatively few Kenyans enjoy formal employment in the sector. The most recent data shows that the total number of people who are formally employed in agriculture by both the private sector and public sector is close to 340,000.",How
138,teenage pregnancies in Kenya increased due to COVID-19 containment measures?,"In June 2020, Kenyan media carried a disturbing report of a surge in teen pregnancies that threatened to cut short the education of many school-going girls. The report zeroed in on data from a four-month study in Machakos County.The report said that in the first four months that schools were closed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, about 4,000 girls below the age of 19 became pregnant in the county.The claim was made by the Machakos Children’s Department officer, Salome Muthama, who accused parents of neglecting their children and urged them to step up their role, saying a majority of the cases involve close relatives.The high pregnancy numbers were attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown, but the suggestion has been met with shock, angst, and disbelief.Many countries face a similar challenge. The closure of schools and restrictions on movement have benefitted public health, but heightened the likelihood of girls being in close quarters with predatory family members and neighbours at home.So the question is, have teenage pregnancies in Kenya increased due to COVID-19 containment measures?PesaCheck has looked into the claim that there has been a surge in the number of teenage pregnancies during COVID -19 containment measures, and finds it to be FALSE for the following reasons:Teen pregnancies are a major challenge for socioeconomic development because they deprive young girls of the opportunity to further their education and attain their career goals. It also exposes the teens and their unborn babies to major health risks.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death among girls aged 15–19 years globally. Approximately 12 million girls aged 15–19 years and at least 777,000 girls under 15 years give birth each year in developing regions.A 2017 study of maternal deaths in Kenya revealed that nine percent of the women who died in hospital were teenagers. Only half of the women who died had antenatal care.Of pregnant teenagers who survive childbirth, nearly 98 percent drop out of school, according to research conducted by Plan International in nine counties last year.Kenya’s 2019 population census found that there were 153,974 girls aged 10 to 19 in Machakos County, which had a population of 1.4 million. Nationally, some 5.7 million girls fall in this age group.A recent report by UNFPA says 378,397 teenage pregnancies were recorded between July 2016 and June 2017, and 28,932 of these pregnancies occurred among girls aged 10–14. Overall, one in five girls have children before their 19th birthday in Kenya, according to data from the Ministry of Health.The United Nations says that over a period of three months in lockdown due to COVID-19 152,000 teenage girls in Kenya became pregnant. These numbers, from early July, are some of the earliest pieces of evidence linking the COVID-19 pandemic to unintended pregnancies.The data on teenage pregnancies in Machakos is drawn from the Kenya Health Information System which links to data from health facilities in all 47 counties. The KHIS system found the number of teenage pregnancies fell nationally, from 175,488 in 2019 to 151,433 in 2020.Nairobi County leads with 11,795 teenage pregnancies in the period between January to May 2020. This is slightly higher than last year’s figures for the same period where there were 11,410 cases of teen pregnancy reported. Kakamega is second with 6,686 cases compared to 8,109 cases last year.Machakos, which has been the focus of the latest public outcry, is ranked 14th with 3,966 cases registered this year, a decline from 4,710 cases last year.The total numbers reported for the period January to May 2020 for all counties is 151,433, compared to 175,488 for the same period in 2019. This is close to the 2020 figure reported by the UN.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education has distanced itself from the figures quoted by the Machakos Children’s Department. During the daily COVID-19 update by the Ministry of Health on June 23, the chief administrative secretary for Health, Dr Mercy Mwangangi, reported that their review of the data found it to be inaccurate, although she said they were working closely with counties to provide youth-friendly clinics for the teenagers affected.Dr Mwangangi said that the Machakos data had been “inaccurately extrapolated”. She said the figure of 4,000 did not represent the numerical count of individual teenagers presenting to the clinic with new pregnancies.Also taking a similar stand is the governor of Machakos County, Alfred Mutua, who said the actual number was lower, and confusion may have arisen from multiple visits of pregnant girls to hospitals.In April, the United Nations Population Fund warned that lockdown-related disruptions could leave 47 million women in low and middle-income countries without modern contraceptives, resulting in 7 million additional unintended pregnancies.It is important to note that the KHIS data only captures cases reported in the health sector and so it is possible that there are many other pregnant girls who are not counted because they have not been to health centres.High-risk teen pregnancies have been a societal challenge for Kenya. Government demographic data from 2014 shows that 15 percent of girls aged 15–19 had already given birth, and another three percent were pregnant with their first child — the highest rates in East Africa.While the real incidence of teenage pregnancies is high across the country, the evidence presented does not support claims that there has been an upsurge in teenage pregnancy as a result of the closure of schools and movement restrictions associated with COVID-19 containment measures, making the claims contained in media reports FALSE.",Have
139,7 Kenyan women die from breast cancer every day?,"Every October, the world marks the Breast Cancer Awareness Month, with campaigns to increase awareness and encourage screening of the disease.This year’s campaigns come amid a claim by the Oncology Nurses Chapter-Kenya; that seven women die every day in Kenya as a result of breast cancer.As part of creating awareness, women as well as men, are encouraged to adopt a healthy diet, avoid alcohol intake and smoking, exercise regularly, do a breast self-examination and watch their weight.A healthy population is essential for development in a nation, and this is the reason why ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The Jubilee administration pledged better healthcare in line with the SDGs, making Universal Healthcare one of the four pillars of its Big Four Agenda. Two key promises by the government are achieving free, quality primary healthcare for all Kenyans and establishment of a specialised cancer hospital in the country by the end of the second term.While government action to fight cancer appears to have a solid strategy, implementation has been far from impressive. Policy papers such as the 2011–2016 and 2017–2022 cancer strategy papers outline comprehensive interventions that the government and other partners need to undertake in order to enhance existing structures and pull together additional resources to tackle the challenges posed by cancer.So the question is, does breast cancer kill 7 women in Kenya every day?PesaCheck has looked into the claim that seven women die every day in Kenya as a result of breast cancer, and finds it to be TRUE for the following reasons:Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. While men too are at risk of breast cancer, the prevalence is significantly low, compared to women.Breast cancer incidence rates are varied, recording as high as 89.7 per 100,000 women in Western Europe, and 19.3 per 100,000 women in Eastern Africa, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows. In 2018, there were 2.09 million people worldwide affected by breast cancer, with 627,000 deaths that year alone.Survival rates range from 80 percent in North America to below 40 percent in low-income countries. Mortality from breast cancer is highest in Sub Saharan Africa, where up to 80 percent of diagnosed cases occur later, during Stage III or IV.The poor survival of breast cancer patients in Sub Saharan Africa has been associated with late presentation, poor health care infrastructure and lack of adequate funding, amidst other competing public health challenges.Early detection can increase the survival rates of the patient, studies have found, making it important to check for the signs and symptoms of breast cancer.Symptoms may include- presence of lump in the breast, pain in the breast, swelling in areas near the breasts, discharge from nipple other than breast milk, change in the shape of the nipple and swelling under arm. While these may not always be an indication of breast cancer, any of these signs should be reported to the doctor immediately.In Kenya, cancer is the 3rd leading cause of death after infectious and cardiovascular diseases. The International Agency for Research in Cancer (IARC) GLOBOCAN report for 2018 estimated there were 47,887 new cases of cancer annually with a mortality of 32,987. The previous report estimated 37,000 new cancer cases yearly, with an annual mortality of 28,500 in 2012 — an almost 45 percent increase.The WHO data shows breast cancer has an incidence rate of 12.5 percent annually in Kenya, putting it as the most frequent cancer among women of all ages, with a mortality rate of 7.7 percent.Every year approximately 5,500 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer and 2,000 patients lose their lives to this disease. This shows an increasing trend in the number of women being diagnosed with the disease.Annually, there are 2,553 deaths that occur due to breast cancer, making it among the leading causes of deaths in Kenyan women according to the Global Cancer Observatory.The data above shows that breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women in Kenya, with approximately 2,553 deaths annually. Therefore, using that figure, the claim that breast cancer kills seven women daily in Kenya is TRUE.",Do

It, however, doesn’t mention the location of the incident.The BBI report was relaunched at the Bomas of Kenya on October 26. The initiative — the brainchild of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Odinga — was conceived in March 2018 in the famous “Handshake” agreement, that ended months of post-election demonstrations and confrontations that had seen dozens killed by the police.In the report, the BBI task force has come up with a number of recommendations, including restructuring government to re-introduce a hybrid system of government featuring shared power between a president and a prime minister, with members of Kenya’s parliament now allowed to become part of the Cabinet. Election losers have been tossed a bone, with the runner-up in the presidential elections, automatically gaining a seat in parliament as leader of the official opposition.However, the photo in the post doesn’t show Mr Odinga being chased away from a rally by an angry mob on October 30.The former prime minister left the country on October 29, for a two-day visit in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in his capacity as the African Union (AU) High Representative for Infrastructure Development, where he is expected to meet with the host, President Felix Tshisekedi, to review the progress of the Grand Inga Hydropower project.A reverse image search also shows that the photo was published on November 17, 2017, when Mr Odinga returned to Kenya after boycotting the rerun of the presidential elections held that year.

The diploma courses listed are computer science, engineering skills, accounting technicians and forestry management among others.The poster says applicants must be Kenyan citizens, must undergo a COVID-19 test and be ready to undertake their prefered course in any part of Kenya.Applicants for the certificate courses are expected to have attained grades between E to D+, the post adds, while those applying for the diploma course much have scored C- to C+. While this grading system is similar to the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) the post does not say in which examination applicants must attain the grades.Applications are to be sent by email to a yahoo webmail account by November 2, 2020, indicating the course the applicant wishes to undertake, their county and sub-county of residence as well as their telephone number.The post also includes what appears to be a photo of the post’s author and a message that encourages the public to apply for the courses.However, neither the poster nor its contents are published on the NYS website, as is the norm with all recruitment of youth to join the voluntary program for Kenyan citizens, according to the guidelines under the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) tab.The FAQs section highlights the fact that recruitment to the NYS is carried out twice a year and the minimum academic qualification is a KCSE grade D plain. There is no provision for an E grade as claimed in the poster.The NYS website also says that during recruitment exercises, applicants are normally asked to present themselves in their areas when announced, rather than email their applications as claimed by the poster in question.On October 28, 2020, the NYS tweeted a screenshot of the poster, terming it fake and labelling it a scam.PesaCheck has looked into the poster shared on Facebook and claiming that the National Youth Service is offering free courses for servicemen and women and finds it to be FAKE.",FAKE:

Will he still support the expansion of the executive which he vehemently opposed?” (sic).However, a number of elements on the screenshot show that the tweet is not authentic.

The al-Shabaab militant group allegedly stoned to death a 44-year-old man in Rama Addey town in southern Somalia’s Bay region, having found him guilty of adultery”.A blog post published on December 15, 2009, which quotes AFP global news agency, identifies the partially buried man as Mohamed Abukar Ibrahim, 48.

The excessive use of force by police officers witnessed at the beginning of the dusk-to-dawn curfew in Kenya on March 27, 2020 was roundly condemned by human rights activists.The footage also cuts to a news clip showing police supervising the demolition of houses in Kariobangi, Nairobi, with residents expressing their displeasure about it. The demolition, which took place on May 8, 2020, amidst a cessation of movement order in and out of Nairobi, reportedly left 5,000 people homeless and was also met with widespread criticism.On April 1, 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta issued an apology to Kenyans for the incidences of excesses by the police while enforcing the curfew order.The clip in question contains a number of inconsistencies, including that the reflection on the table below the television screen does not show the footage. Rather, it shows a split screen with still images of what appears to be participants in a virtual conference.Additionally, only the images on the television screen are moving — rather than the entire frame of the video — as is usually the case with normal footage.An internet search shows that the video is actually a doctored image of President Kenyatta during the inauguration of the COVID-19 conference on August 31, 2020. The image does not show President Kenyatta watching the video in question on the screen, but other participants of the virtual conference whose reflection on the table also corresponds to the images on the screenThe conference was convened by the Council of Governors to reflect on the government’s COVID-19 response efforts, challenges and offer recommendations on strategic policy measures to be adopted by both the national and county governments in readiness for future pandemics.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a video claiming to show President Uhuru Kenyatta watching footage of Kenyans being assaulted by police during curfew, and finds it to be ALTERED.",ALTERED:

The Montauk Monster refers to a carcass that was supposedly found and photographed by three women in July 2008 on a beach in Montauk, New York.As it turns out, the primary image in this digital manipulation has been used in several older marine hoaxes.Another reverse image search led us to a photo of a dead whale that beached at Maule on the Gulf of Arauco in Chile, in November 2011.

The debate followed the advisory issued by Chief Justice David Maraga to President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve parliament for failing to comply with four court orders directing it to enact the required law for gender representation.According to article 27(3) and (8), 81(b) and 100 of the Kenyan constitution, not more than two-thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies should be of the same gender.However, giving himself as an example, Mr Mbadi — who also doubles up as chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement’s (ODM) party — says the fact that people in his constituency elected him rather than the woman who opposed him for the position implies that they have no problem electing a man to represent them in parliament.He also claims that the advisory by the chief Justice means that people in his constituency should have elected his opponent, adding that there was nothing more unjust.“We need to realize the gender principle but this is not the way to do it. …You will dissolve this parliament a thousand times and the next election will bring more men than it is today in this house…If it is not me, it will be another man elected in Suba South,” said Mr Mbadi, who is also the leader of the minority party in parliament.So, the question is, how true is the claim that women comprise over 50 percent of voters in Suba South constituency?PesaCheck has examined the claim that there are more female voters than there are male in Suba constituency and found that it is TRUE, based on the following:The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission’s (IEBC) 2017 records Suba Suba South constituency as having a total of 46,499 registered voters. The voter distribution by gender shows that out of this number, female voters account for 24,054. This means that there are 1,609 more female voters compared to male voters. It also means that the percentage of female voters in Suba South stands at 51.7 percent.The percentage of registered voters in Suba South constituency who are women is higher than the national average, which saw a 2 percent decline to stand at 46.6 percent of the total 19,678,885 voters registered as at December 31, 2019.",Do

Recently, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have increasingly been used as a tool for public safety to screen passengers at airports or check incoming customers at shop entrances. An elevated body temperature (fever) is one of the signs and symptoms of COVID-19.Despite the highly contagious nature of the aforementioned diseases, the thermometer gun reduces the risk of cross-contamination due to its non-contact approach.PesaCheck looked through some of the causes of memory loss listed by various medical publications and found the use of thermometer guns is not listed as one of them.The MayoClinic.org, WebMD, and Harvard Medical School all list head injury or trauma, emotional disorders, chronic disorders, hypothyroidism, brain diseases and Vitamin B-12 deficiency as some of the causes of memory loss.However, the screenshot in question was shared in a group called “Science Humour”, whose description is “Seeing Humor in Life, The Universe and Everything Since 2011”.

It goes on to say that the “commissioner” has received complaints from applicants who have no access to merit lists, — a rank based on marks achieved in an examination — for a number of schools.While the letter is fake, the interest in and concern about the teacher recruitment process is being followed widely, as applicants anticipate the interviews.

171,These guidelines for getting a medical report for immigration to Canada are not legitimate,"A Google form with instructions on how to apply for an immigration medical report form (IMM 1017E) in order to travel to Canada for work is a HOAX.The guidelines are a doctored variation of those available on the Immigration and Citizenship page (IRCC) of the official website of the Government of Canada.According to IRCC, obtaining the IMM 1017E applies to those planning to stay in the country for more than six months, or take up jobs that bring them into close contact with people.IRCC advises applicants against going to their personal doctors for the medical exam as reports are only accepted from approved panel physicians. The website provides a link which leads to a search function, through which applicants can locate approved panel physicians in their country.In Kenya, IOM Kenya — MHAC Clinic is the only facility, approved to conduct the medical exam, that is listed on the website.The Google form does not refer to approved panel physicians and instead lists the Aga Khan and Mater hospitals as those authorised to conduct the medical examination.Applicants are asked to select the facility nearest them to book an appointment with the doctor.The Google form also contains a doctored version of instructions under the “What you need to pay for” section, to include a requirement for applicants to pay an all-inclusive fee of KSh 1,500 for the various tests they will undergo during the visit to the physician.A mobile money transfer number is provided, through which applicants can pay the fee, after which they are expected to key in the transaction code into the form. The instructions say the fee is refundable if the visa application does not go through.However, the IRCC website is explicit in its instructions to applicants that they should pay for the medical exam when they visit the physician. The fee is also not all-inclusive and is non-refundable, whether or not the visa application goes through, but refugees and asylum seekers are exempt from payment.Additionally, the IOM Kenya website says that payment of the service fee can be made in cash (if less than Ksh 10,000) by bank deposit, with a deposit slip provided by the IOM cashier, or via M-Pesa to a PayBill provided at MHAC.Further, the IRCC website gives prospective immigrants the option of conducting a medical exam before they make their application for immigration, but these details are omitted from the guidelines on the Google form.PesaCheck has looked into the Google form with instructions on how applicants travelling to Canada for work can obtain the required immigration medical report form (IMM 1017E) and finds it to be a HOAX.",HOAX:

Let our voice be heard.”A Facebook post in which the original photo appears is dated January 25, 2019 and reads “Male Sex Workers Demand for Respect”.The word Kisumu on the original photo has, evidently, been erased and replaced with the image of a cap in colours of the Kenyan flag resembling the headgear that has become DP Ruto’s trademark. The text “Ruto supports our hustle” has been added to the bottom right of the banner.A week ago, PesaCheck debunked a similar claim about a photo in which a banner was doctored to show that the Kenya Sex Workers Association (KESWA) has endorsed the deputy president’s 2022 presidential bid.PesaCheck has looked into a photo claiming to show male sex workers with a banner reading in part “Ruto supports our hustle” and finds it to be ALTERED.",ALTERED:

The image on the fake cover page shows him in a red polo shirt and black cap.The legitimate cover page also contains a number of news bullets on other events relating to Dr Ruto, as well as a blurb with a quote by Siaya Senator James Orengo saying he filed a motion in the past to impeach the DP for disrespecting the president. The fake front-page does not have this additional content.In a Facebook post, The Standard shared the fake front page alongside the legitimate one and cautioned readers to avoid buying into this misinformation.It is not the first time the publication’s front cover has been altered.

Further, the political faction dubbed “Tangatanga”, which supports the deputy president will “transport goons to those rallies and police deployed to deal with them,” the post adds.The post does not say when or where the sentiments attributed to the NSAC were made.While the NSAC has acknowledged heightened political tensions in the country as a result of early campaigning for the 2022 elections, it has not banned political gatherings convened by Mr Ruto as claimed by the post.Rather, during a press conference on October 7, the NSAC invoked Section 5 of the Public Order Act that requires all conveners of public gatherings to notify the police three days before they take place.The NSAC also directed that organisers of political gatherings should be present throughout the meeting, maintain law and order and not use language that discriminates or incites people on the basis of ethnicity, tribe, colour, religion, gender, disability or otherwise.The NSAC has further called on all those who attend public rallies to exercise a high degree of civic duty and responsibility and not be in possession of any weapons, while the media and social media users have been asked to take responsibility for all the content they publish and broadcast from such meetings.Mr Kinyua says that if left unchecked, the utterances and political weaponization of public gatherings will undermine law and order in the country.“This situation is increasingly polarizing the country along ethnopolitical lines and therefore undermining national cohesion peace and security and derailing our transformative economic agenda,” he said.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the National Security Advisory Council (NSAC), through an announcement made by the Head of Public Service, Joseph Kinyua, has banned all political gatherings organised by Deputy President William Ruto, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

According to the post, the threats made by the US follows government moves to ban public rallies, an act seen as targeting Deputy President Dr William Ruto’s campaigns.It says Mr Pompeo’s statement, issued on October 8, 2020, expresses concern over the shrinking political space in Kenya, saying repression and intimidation have no place in democracies.The post, published by the Daily Star, was also shared on various platforms on Facebook, including Kenya Breaking News/ Kenya Siasa, Hon G K Malema and Magufuli Benjamin.The post gets a number of things right about Mr Pompeo’s statement, which reiterates the US’s commitment to support free, fair and inclusive elections and hails the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression as being important for democracy.It is also true that the statement says the US will not hesitate to consider consequences — including visa restrictions — for those responsible for election-related violence.However, it does not specifically mention President Uhuru Kenyatta as claimed in the post.Further, the statement itself is titled ‘Upcoming Elections in Africa’, indicating that it is directed at countries in Africa that are preparing for elections in the near future.Several countries are expected to hold elections in the Sub-Saharan Africa region in 2020, including Guinea, Tanzania, Côte D’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, the Central African Republic, and Niger. Liberia is also expected to conduct a referendum and senatorial elections in 2020 while Nigeria will hold gubernatorial elections.General elections in Kenya are not expected to take place until 2022, when the terms of the current elected officials expire. However, a section of the political elite has been pushing for a referendum to amend the constitution, although no date has been set.An advisory issued by the chief justice calling on the president to dissolve parliament has also raised the possibility of a snap election despite the fact that the president is yet to pronounce himself on the issue.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, has issued a statement threatening to revoke President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visa, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

This information is not available on the official website of the Ministry of Education, nor on its Twitter handle.Speaking to PesaCheck on the phone, the head of communications in the Ministry of Education, Kennedy Buhere, dismissed the claim.“The position of the ministry remains and nothing has changed,” Mr Buhere said.The Ministry of Education announced the phased reopening of both public and private schools starting from October 12, which saw Grade 4 of the Competency-Based Curriculum Class, Class 8 and Form 4 students return to school.The announcement, made on October 6, has animated public debate, with some parents fearing for the safety of their children while others wondering how they will raise school fees.However, the ministry said the decision to reopen schools was reached after broad-based consultations with stakeholders in the country.

Nor has the mainstream media carried such a report as they normally do when there is a change or update concerning an issue of national interest such as this.So far, the only news related to the same topic is the announcement that the government will release funds to run public schools beginning this week.The tweet also claims that the decision to reopen schools has been suspended until the case filed by Mr Omtata is heard, but a search on the High Court database of cases scheduled for hearing shows no case challenging the reopening of schools’ listed.

The organisation is run by member states, with major decisions made by the members, ministers, ambassadors or delegates.With a membership of 164 nations, the WTO is the largest international economic institution in the world. Essentially, the WTO is a place where member governments try to sort out the trade problems they face with each other.On 31 August 2020, Robert Azevêdo stepped down as the organisation’s Director-General, a year before the expiry of his mandate. At the time of his resignation, the 62-year-old Brazilian was serving his second term at the helm of the global trade institution.Mr Azevêdo’s departure saw the general council chair, David Walker, launch the selection process to appoint a new DG. The procedures for appointing the WTO director-general are clearly described in UN documentation.The process involves nominating of candidates by member states, a three-month period for the nominees to interact with and make themselves known to members and concludes with the selection of one from among the candidates.The nomination period for the 2020 DG selection process ended on July 8, with eight candidates nominated by their respective governments. On September 18, the general council chair announced results of the first round of consultations and the five candidates advancing to the next stage.Results from the second round of consultations were announced on October 8, and two candidates — Dr Okonjo-Iweala and South Korea’s Trade minister, Yoo Myung-hee — now advance to the third and final round of the selection process.The WTO acknowledges the shortlisting of the two women candidates via the official Twitter page on October 8, saying it creates a historic precedent for the WTO, where the 7th director-general will become the first woman ever to lead the organisation.Dr Okonjo-Iwela took to Twitter to appreciate her supporters.Similarly, Minister Myung-hee through her official Twitter handle, @YoonMyunghee1, responded to the announcement made by WTO.Most importantly, consultations for the third and final phase will resume on October 19, and run until October 27.PesaCheck has previously debunked a false claim that Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Heritage and Culture, Amina Mohamed, won the position of Director-General of the WTO against Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.

189,This video does not show Deputy President William Ruto fleeing an angry Nairobi mob,"A Facebook post with a video showing commotion and claiming the melee was caused by a crowd chasing Deputy President William Ruto out of Nairobi’s Gikomba area on September 20 is FALSE.The clip, published on the ‘Bigwig Kenya News’ Facebook page, shows people running — some of whom appear to be journalists with cameras — and cars speeding off as teargas is lobbed.The video is accompanied by text saying the crowd was irked after the deputy president addressed them as ‘hustlers’ — a term he uses frequently but which they felt was derogatory. The post says the crowd threw stones to show their displeasure, forcing police attached to the DP to lob teargas in a bid to control them.While DP Ruto did address a crowd at Nairobi’s Gikomba area on September 20, the video published on the Bigwig Kenya News Facebook page does not show events that occurred then.Photos shared by the DP from the event show him addressing crowds, with stalls visible in the background of the busy Gikomba market.A Google reverse image search reveals that the video shows events that took place in Mumias County on January 18, 2020. The video clip ran on KTN as part of a report that police dispersed a crowd heading for the venue for a rally convened by a section of Mumias leaders opposed to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).The meeting, slated to take place at the Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega, was cancelled, along with other gatherings in different centres on the outskirts of Mumias town, rendering the Bomani grounds meeting impossible.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a video showing commotion involving a convoy of cars and a large gathering of people, and claiming that the melee centred around a crowd chasing Deputy President William Ruto away from Gikomba market area of Nairobi, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

193,Kenya’s elephant numbers double between 1989 and 2018?,"According to Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Tourism and Wildlife Najib Balala, Kenya’s elephant numbers more than doubled between 1989 and 2018, thanks to increased anti-poaching efforts.Speaking to the press on World Elephant Day in August 2020, CS Balala said Kenya had just 16,000 elephants in 1989, and this number rose to more than 34,000 in 2018. The CS added that seven elephants had been poached so far in 2020, down from 34 in 2019, and 80 in 2018.CS Balala was speaking during a visit to Amboseli National Park, where he also attached a tracking collar to a bull elephant and the named a pair of twin calves.By 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported that Africa’s elephant population had seen its worst decline in 25 years, mostly due to intensified poaching for ivory.In East Africa, elephant populations have nearly halved in a decade (1979 to 1989). The African elephant — the species found in Kenya — is currently considered vulnerable, with the sharp decline in population blamed on poaching.Poaching for ivory is one of three major threats to the survival of the African elephant, the other two being the loss of habitat and human-elephant conflict.So the question is, have Kenya’s elephant numbers doubled from 1989 to 2018?Records from the 1970s and 1980s show that poaching threatened the survival of elephants, reducing their population to a fraction of what it was in the 1960s.In 2013, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) put elephant numbers at an estimated 16,000, declining from approximately 167,000 between 1979 and 1989.On July 19, 1989, the New York Times reported that Kenya’s elephant herds had reduced to 17,000 from 65,000 in 1979.After the CITES trade ban in 1989, elephant populations rebounded through the early 2000s. However, by 2007, a continental estimate by Save the Elephants showed the number of elephants remaining in the wild to be at an all-time low, as the resurgence in demand for ivory brought new and intense waves of poaching. By 2011, some areas of Africa reported the highest level of poaching rates ever recorded, and elephant populations across the continent were decimated by illegal poaching to feed a booming international trade in ivory from the harvested tusks.However, a report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature shows that from 2007, Kenya was one of four African countries where elephant numbers began to stabilise and increase, with the other countries being Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia.By 2018, it was reported that 40 elephants were poached in Kenya, a 50 percent reduction compared to the previous year. In 2019, the number dropped to 34.The animal census shows that the elephant population in Kenya continues to grow annually. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the significant decline in poaching in Kenya is not seen across the rest of Africa, and the IUCN still considers them a vulnerable species.A statement released by Kenya Wildlife Service on August 12, to mark World Elephant Day, largely reaffirms the elephant population numbers announced by the CS, noting that the numbers have doubled over the past 30 years, increasing from 16,000 in 1989, to 34,800 by the end of 2019.Additionally, Amboseli National Park, one of the most popular parks in Kenya, is experiencing an elephant baby boom, with 170 elephant calves born in 2020, including two sets of twins, a rare occurrence among the species.In contrast, there were 113 new calves born in the whole of 2018, according to the Amboseli Trust for Elephants.The evidence shows that over the past 30 years, Kenya’s elephant population has flourished, with numbers more than doubling — from 16,000 in 1989, to 34,800 in 2019.This makes the claim by Tourism CS Najib Balala TRUE.",Did

Once again we wish to advise applicants and the general public to be vigilant of individuals and social media accounts that specialize in spreading fake news,” TSC’s head of corporate affairs Ms Beatrice Wababu said on Facebook.This is not the first time that claims about the cancellation of the mass recruitment of teachers are making the rounds on social media.

196,much of Kenya’s revenue goes towards paying pensions?,"Since 2018, the national government has been keen to tame the growing expenditure on pensions and in 2019 conducted a payroll cleanup to stamp out ghost pensioners.Reacting to the headline “Inside Kalonzo, Raila and Kibaki Sh785 million pension in The Star newspaper on May 3, 2020, Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot tweeted that Kenya’s pension budget is close to 10 percent of national revenue.The senator added that it is “totally unsustainable” for the country to continue bearing this burden and wondered, “isn’t it time we asked everyone to just survive on what they saved while in office?”So, the question is, how true is the claim that Kenya’s pension budget constitutes about 10 percent of national revenue?PesaCheck has examined the claim that Kenya’s pension budget is about 10 percent of national revenue and found it to be PARTLY FALSE, based on the following:There is no doubt that the pension budget is growing rapidly, a development that prompted the National Treasury to conduct what it termed a “pension cleansing exercise” in 2019 to ascertain the actual number of pensioners and their dependants.In the financial year (FY) 2019/2020 budget statement, former National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich called for pension reforms, noting that the pension budget had increased more than threefold in the last 10 years. In FY 2008/09, pensions paid out by the government totalled KSh 25 billion, but by FY 2018/2019 the figure had risen to KSh 86 billion.The wage bill for Kenya’s 800,000 public servants reached KSh 795 billion for the financial year ending June 2019, a difference of KSh 240 billion over five years earlier. The wage bill for FY 2019/2020 touched KSh 830 billion.An estimated 20,000 public servants reach the mandatory retirement age of 60 each year and this has seen the annual pension bill balloon, increasing from KSh 32.4 billion to reach KSh 104.5 billion in five years, as data below shows.The government of Kenya is already running huge budget deficits, coupled with mounting public debt and the International Monetary Fund has issued a warning about the country’s pension sector following the widening disparity between retirement dues and actual savings.Given that Kenya pays pension from tax collections, its percentage can be established as illustrated in the table. By this calculation, pension budgets as a percentage of total tax collections have so far reached only 6.5 percent, which is less than the 10 percent claimed by Senator Cheruiyot.These statistics show that the pensions budget, as a percentage of total revenue collected by the taxman, is on an upward trend. A ballooning pensions budget could crash government efforts to canalize resources to development and hurt the economy significantly.In the budget statement for fiscal year 2018/2019, the Treasury indicated that they had developed a National Pension Policy to be implemented alongside the Public Service Superannuation Scheme (PSSS) Act in an effort to free resources for other vital national priorities.Data from the Controller of Budget between 2015 and 2020 show that CFS budgetary allocation for pension and gratuities are growing, but still below 15 percent.Pension and gratuities are a component of Consolidated Fund Services (CFS), which includes other elements such as public debt and salaries and allowances. With the above data, pension and gratuities still do not take the largest chunk of Consolidated Funds Services like repayment of public debt. However, the pension budget is growing every financial year, a trend that demands a sustainability strategy from the government.With Kenya’s pension payment bill declared unsustainable, the stage is now set for urgent reforms. After union workers obtained a court injunction against contract hiring of public servants that was set to begin on July 1, 2019, the government announced a three-year freeze on hiring, which is now in effect.",How

Usually, a requirement to “share” a giveaway like this is a sign of a scam.This is an example of engagement bait, where posts on social media ask users to interact by liking, commenting or sharing. The more respondents do this, the greater the scam’s reach.In addition, the government of Kenya has not announced any such a giveaway, and no local media outlet has reported this, as would have been the case if it were true.A WhoIs search of the website carrying the advertisement shows it was created on August 11, 2020, the same day the message showed up on WhatsApp groups and social media platforms.The whole application process appears to be a phishing scam, where individuals are asked to share personal information such as phone details and identification numbers, then asked to share the link to find new victims.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the government of Kenya has set aside KSh 2 billion to be distributed equally to all citizens aged 20 and above and finds it to be a HOAX.",FALSE:

The blog post links to a YouTube video of the event uploaded on September 20, 2012.Citizen TV also posted a news piece of the same event on September 18, 2012. A careful look at the videos and the photo on the blog reveals that the appearance of the individuals holding the banner match those in the image in question.However, the text on the banner reads “Stop killing sex workers. They are human”, and says nothing about political campaigns nor supporting the deputy president as claimed in the post.In a Facebook post on September 28, 2020, KESWA distanced itself from the claim that it had endorsed Dr Ruto’s presidential bid, saying it does not engage in politics or endorse any political party, candidate or person.While the association acknowledged that the photo was from one of their previous protests, it disowned the political messaging on the banner shown in the image.“We wish to call on the relevant authorities to investigate the source of these images which have been used to malign certain individuals. We are committed to supporting sex workers rights in Kenya and wish to do so in non-violent means and we will not be used for ulterior motives,” reads KESWA’s post in part.PesaCheck has looked into a photo claiming to show members of KESWA marching with a banner endorsing DP Ruto’s presidential bid and finds it to be ALTERED.",ALTERED:

Covifor is the generic brand of remdesivir drug.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency approval for use of remdesivir for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. The drug was shown in a clinical trial to reduce recovery time for some COVID-19 patients.The World Health Organization (WHO), a specialised United Nations agency in charge of international public health, says that there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease, but there are several ongoing clinical trials.The same position is echoed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which indicates that there is no specific cure yet for COVID-19.However, the CDC, through the National Institutes of Health, has published guidelines and recommendations based on scientific evidence on clinical management and treatment of COVID-19.PesaCheck has investigated photos showing antiviral medicines with a regulatory notice restricting distribution in the US, Canada, and the EU, and finds they are ALTERED.",ALTERED:
207,This page mimicking the branding of Weekly Citizen newspaper is fake,"A Facebook page publishing content under the logo and banner of the Weekly Citizen newspaper is FAKE.The Facebook page is not the legitimate account of the Weekly Citizen newspaper.The publication’s authentic page, named “Weekly Citizen Newspaper”, has 33,706 likes. Additionally, the Weekly Citizen’s Facebook profile features a newspaper clipping of the publication, with its logo, slogan, and website address on the cover page.On the other hand, the impostor page is called ‘Citizen Weekly’, has 30,359 likes, but also features the logo, slogan and banner of the legitimate Weekly Citizen on its profile.Although the cover photo of the impostor page contains the Weekly Citizen’s legitimate website address, the ‘About’ page contains a link to a different website that has not published any content yet.Additionally, the Facebook Page Transparency information of the legitimate Weekly Citizen’s account shows it was created on June 26, 2014.Conversely, the Facebook Transparency information of the impostor page shows it was created on August 14, 2018.Further, the domain name of the legitimate Weekly Citizen newspaper website is weeklycitizen.co.ke, and which a WHOIS search shows was registered on July 15, 2016.But the domain name of the link on the ‘About’ page of the impostor Facebook account is citizenweekly.com, which was registered on June 16, 2019.On September 21, Weekly Citizen issued a statement disowning the imposter Facebook page after it claimed that Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) boss Joshua Oigara helped Deputy President William Ruto to launder KSh 2 billion.“We have reported this matter to facebook headquarters for appropriate action to be taken against these impersonators, and steps are also being taken to bring this to the attention of cybercrime unit and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) for appropriate action,” the statement read in part.Meanwhile, The Standard newspaper has also disowned a newspaper front page dated September 25, 2020 with a similar story as the one shared on the impostor Weekly Citizen Facebook page.The legitimate front page of the newspaper for the date contains a story of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s phone call to Deputy President Dr William Ruto over the Msambweni constituency’s by-election slated for December 15.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook page with the logo of Weekly Citizen newspaper and publishing content in the name of the publication, and finds it to be FAKE.",FAKE:
208,This website claiming WhatsApp is giving away 50GB internet bundles is a scam,"A website offering 50GB internet bundles for free to users who complete a survey on how they use WhatsApp is a HOAX.The free data is meant to celebrate WhatsApp’s 10th anniversary — an occasion that the company marked in February 2019.To claim the free data bundle, participants are asked to take a customer service survey with questions such as how they came to know about the offer and their opinion about the app.PesaCheck also took the survey, which leads to a new page notifying applicants about winning the free data bundle. But even though the said data bundle is not debited to their phones, the instructions require them to share a message that they have won to 20 friends or 5 groups via a WhatsApp button on the page, failure to which they will not receive the prize.The message template to be shared states that the free internet bundle is valid for 90 days. The message also includes what looks like a testimonial by the participant stating that they have received the free data, asking the recipient to share the message before the data on offer was exhausted.The message further contains a linkback to the website with the giveaway, and does not direct to the official WhatsApp website.WhatsApp’s Facebook and Twitter handles do not have the information on the free internet offer either.A WHOIS search of the legitimate WhatsApp website shows that it was registered on September 4, 2008.A WHOIS search of the impostor site shows that it was registered on December 10, 2019.Scammers use tactics similar to those on the website in question to carry out click fraud, a common scheme which relies on luring users to bogus websites with the promise of getting a reward. Those who fall prey to these clickbaits are also urged to share it with more people, which ultimately brings revenues to the operators of the fake offers, advertisements or campaigns.PesaCheck has looked into a website offering 50GB internet bundles from WhatsApp for free to users who share a message with their contacts, and finds it to be FALSE.",HOAX:

Next, they are required to provide their phone number, which is then validated.A new webpage opens, notifying the user that they qualify to receive KSh 3,800 for free. To redeem the prize, they are instructed to share this news with 12 WhatsApp groups, following which their mobile money wallet will be credited with the cash within four minutes.Once users click the WhatsApp button, the message delivered to recipients urges them to visit the website and participate in the promotion before the October 24, 2020 deadline.The url of the website — https://bit.ly/SafaricomReward — has been shortened and customised using bit.ly, a URL shortener that allows customisation of the text in a link and can sometimes be used by spammers to mask the identity of the landing page URL. In this case, the actual domain name is safaricomspin.com, which also hosts a dubious slot machine game.Additionally, the link does not direct to the legitimate Safaricom website, whose domain name is safaricom.co.ke. There is also no information about the promotion in question on Safaricom’s website, Facebook and Twitter handles.The WHO IS information of the safaricomspin.com site shows it was registered on September 9, 2020, in Panama but the identity of the organisation which owns it is hidden.On the other hand, WHO IS information for the legitimate Safaricom website shows it was registered on February 12, 2003 and that it is owned by Safaricom PLC.Mr Chris Karanja, a senior communications manager at Safaricom, told PesaCheck that the company is not running the promotional campaign mentioned in the claim.In a response to queries by users on Twitter, Safaricom has cautioned against participating in the campaign.PesaCheck has looked into a website claiming that telecom giant Safaricom is gifting its subscribers KSh 3,800 as part of the organisation’s annual loyal customers reward program, and finds it to be FALSE.",HOAX:

These are not official contacts tied to the government agency’s domain, which is nca.go.ke and not nca.co.ke as listed on the ad.A look at the Kenya Network Information Centre (KENIC) registry — the company licensed to manage and administer the dot ke domain name — reveals that ‘nca.co.ke’ is still available, and has not been registered.On September 15, NCA tweeted a warning from its official account, saying the public should disregard the ad as it is not legitimate. The post explained that any official communication from the organisation is ordinarily published on the Authority’s website, Facebook or Twitter accounts, or the local dailies. NCA also ran a Facebook post warning the public against the fake job ad.The careers page on the NCA website shows that the organisation is indeed, currently hiring. However, the application process is different from what is mentioned in the fake ad. Job applications are handled via the email [email protected], and candidates are required to fill an online application form on the careers section of the official NCA website.The NCA is a government body mandated to regulate the construction industry.

213,Study from Brazil does not say Jatropha leaves cure HIV/AIDS,"An article claiming that juice made from Jatropha gossypiifolia cures HIV/AIDS misrepresents the findings of the study quoted.The article says that although Jatropha gossypiifolia, also known as Red Jatropha, has medicinal properties, liquid from the plant and seeds is poisonous.Published on the Opera News website, the article accurately reports that a 2014 study has shown that Jatropha gossypiifolia does have medicinal properties, and that liquid from the plant, and its seeds, is poisonous. However, it is incorrect in claiming that extract from the leaves of the plant has been found to cure HIV/AIDS, going as far as recommending a recipe for preparation of a juice from the plant to be taken three times a day.The study referred to in the article correlates closely to one published in June 2014 by researchers from Brazil’s Federal University of Rio Grande Do Norte, who found that the Jatropha gossypiifolia plant contains several compound extracts that may be useful as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiarrheal, antihypertensive, and anticancer agents.The paper recommends further research into these agents and their properties but makes no mention of its potential to cure HIV/AIDS, which would have made headlines if it were true.HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the cells that normally protect the human body, leaving it at risk of infection and susceptible to other diseases. Left without treatment, HIV often progresses to the disease AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome), leaving the immune system badly damaged and prey to multiple infections and diseases.There is no cure for HIV/AIDS. When used as prescribed, antiretroviral drugs can, however, control progress of the disease in infected persons and help prevent transmission by 96 percent by reducing the quantity of virus in the body.Several clinical trials and research are being undertaken to evaluate medical approaches in humans to help researchers find better ways to prevent, detect, or treat HIV/AIDS.Jatropha gossypifolia, commonly known as bellyache bush, is a species of flowering plant in the family, Euphorbiacea. This invasive species is native to Latin America and the Caribbean. It has since been introduced to Australia — where it has been declared a pest — as well as Africa, Asia, and across the Americas.The plant is registered with the National List of Medicinal Plants in Brazil, which recognises Jatropha’s therapeutic potential as an anti-inflammatory, healing, and antihypertensive drug.PesaCheck has investigated an article claiming that the leaves of Jatropha gossypiifolia, which is referred to by some as ‘the wonder plant’, can cure HIV/AIDS, and finds it is FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

217,Typing the name of a phone brand on Facebook does not show if the device used could be counterfeit,"A Facebook post claiming that users can check whether their mobile phones are genuine or not by typing the model name, followed by .com in the comments section of the post is FALSE.However, there is no evidence that following the instructions of the post in question can determine the authenticity of a user’s mobile phone.More than 250 users had commented on the post within 6 days, but most of those who followed the instructions as per the post were only redirected to the websites of the manufacturers of their respective phones.Mobile phones have a unique 15 digit identifier, known as the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI).The IMEI number contains information about the mobile device, including brand, model name, warranty date, carrier info, blacklist status, and purchase date, among others.In order to display the IMEI number of a mobile phone, one is required to dial *#06# on the keypad of their handsets. In some mobile devices, the IMEI number is written on the SIM card tray holder.A user can then key in the IMEI number displayed on the ‘check IMEI lookup function’ on IMEI.info, to search for the number in the Type Allocation Codes (TAC) database.If the mobile phone being examined is genuine, the database search should bring up information that matches it since each phone has a unique IMEI number.On the other hand, if the result of the IMEI number search does not bring up any information or if the information does not match with those of the device being examined, then that device could be fake. Counterfeit phones often use fictitious IMEI numbers, or have no IMEI number at all.In a notice shared by the Communication Authority of Kenya (CA) on Twitter on May 19, the regulatory agency gives instructions on how to verify whether a mobile phone is genuine, directing users to send the IMEI number of the phones they own or intend to buy via text message to a dedicated number.The notice asks consumers to send the IMEI number of their phone to the shortcode 1555, following which they receive a response with details about their handsets.As with the search results on IMEI.info, if the details displayed in the SMS correspond with those of the device whose IMEI is being verified, then it is genuine. If not, then the mobile device is likely a counterfeit.The CA notice also states that counterfeit mobile phones provide poor quality of service and experience, and pose a major threat to personal health and national security.PesaCheck has looked into a claim that commenting on a Facebook post with the model name of a user’s mobile phone followed by .com enables them to determine if their phones are genuine or fake, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

Those applying for a Paybill number are required to download and fill a form from the company website.After filling out the form, Safaricom requires applicants to provide copies of their identification documents, a copy of their KRA pin certificate, bank details, and a CR12 form, which shows that the company is registered in Kenya.PesaCheck has looked into the authenticity of an online application for unsecured loans from an organization called 254 Weza Loans and finds it to be a HOAX.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:
226,Jubilee Party has not endorsed Raila Odinga’s 2022 presidential bid,"A Facebook post claiming that Jubilee Party has endorsed former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s 2022 presidential candidature is FALSE.According to the post, the purported endorsement of Mr Odinga is now confirmed and is a way for the ‘Mount Kenya region’ to return a favour to the former prime minister for endorsing ex-President Mwai Kibaki for the country’s top seat in 2002.However, there is no information on the said endorsement on the website, Facebook, or Twitter handles of the ruling party.An endorsement of this nature would have received widespread coverage on the mainstream media outlets and local dailies, which is not the case.Mr Odinga, the leader of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), has over the recent past established a close relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta following the symbolic handshake between the two in March 2018, which signalled an end to their then bitter political rivalry.In September 2019, Jubilee Party Vice-Chairman David Murathe proposed Mr Odinga’s candidature, saying that he would be a formidable opponent for Deputy President William Ruto in the 2022 presidential election.Dismissing the claim that the ruling party has endorsed Mr Odinga as a presidential candidate, Mr Rapahel Tuju, the Jubilee Party secretary-general, said Mr Murathe’s comments were his personal opinion.“For now, the official position of the party is that there is no endorsement of any presidential candidates either within or outside the Jubilee Party,” Mr Tuju told PesaCheck in a phone interview.The former prime minister has on a number of occasions declined to speak on whether or not he plans to vie for presidency in 2022. In an interview on Citizen TV, Mr Odinga said that his focus is on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), which he believes will create a conducive environment for peaceful elections.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Jubilee Party has endorsed former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s 2022 presidential candidature, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

In April 2020, Ms Ruto dismissed a post claiming that she was offering grants supposedly through her ‘Inua Jamii project’ in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.JOYWO has also been a target of scammers, with a number of posts purporting to offer loans — claims that both Ms Ruto and the organisation dismissed as fake.PesaCheck has looked into the Facebook account claiming that Deputy President William Ruto’s spouse, Rachel, is offering grants to young women and youth, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FAKE:

The interview was part of the broadcaster’s series ‘[email protected]’, marking a decade since the Constitution of Kenya was promulgated.In the scenario recounted in the post, the deputy president was purportedly angry with Mr Ageyo for engaging him with questions outside of what they had agreed on.The post adds that in the ensuing altercation, Dr Ruto grabbed Mr Ageyo by the collar and shoved him to the ground, before the journalist was whisked away by the DP’s aides, to where his colleagues from the Royal Media Services were waiting. Royal Media Services (RMS) is the parent company of Citizen TV.However, the alleged incident has not been published by any mainstream media houses, including Citizen TV, where the journalist works.Mr Lordrick Mayabi, a news producer with Royal Media Services, which owns and runs Citizen TV, told PesaCheck in a phone interview that the media house was aware of the false claim circulating online.“The truth is that it never happened.

236,Face masks do not cause Legionnaires’ disease,"A Twitter thread warning that Legionnaires’ disease can be contracted from wearing the same face mask daily is FALSE.Similar claims were shared widely on social media in August 2020, alleging that Legionnaires’ disease, a respiratory infection that can cause a rare and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia, could be contracted from reused face masks worn to protect against COVID-19.Legionnaires’ disease is caused by a bacterium called legionella and predominantly affects people with compromised immune systems due to age, illness, or a variety of other factors.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC) Legionnaires’ disease is spread when small droplets of water that contain bacteria get into the air and people breathe them in.Large water systems, such as hot tubs, artificial fountains, water used for showering and air-conditioning cooling towers, are common sources of infection.Legionnaires’ disease is not contagious and cannot be transmitted by infected persons or their used masks, according to Legionella.org, a nonprofit organization that shares educational material and scientific research about the disease.“You cannot contract Legionnaires’ disease from wearing face masks. Legionella is not spread from person-to-person in respiratory droplets nor does the bacteria survive on dry surfaces”, an explainer on Legionella’s website states.The explainer further adds that masks are not a source of transmission for the Legionella bacteria.Dr Rita Macharia, a medic at Thika Level 5 hospital, told PesaCheck there is no scientific basis for the claim, as the environment that would be produced by a damp mask is not suitable for legionella to grow and cause Legionnaires’ disease.While an unwashed face mask will not cause Legionnaires’ disease, experts still recommend washing masks after each use as they can be contaminated by bacteria.The World Health Organization (WHO) advises cloth masks should be washed once a day or between each use. Cloth masks should be washed with hot water and laundry detergent and be completely dry before they are worn again.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that people are at risk of contracting Legionnaires’ disease by wearing the same face mask daily and find it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
237,Wearing a face mask does not cause lung infections,"A Facebook post claiming that wearing a mask can cause serious lung infections and loss of consciousness due to restricted airflow is FALSE.The post is accompanied by five photos, showing people who allegedly ended up with staphylococcus infections from wearing masks.However, a reverse image search of the photos shows that they are not related to the claim. The photo on the top right shows a child with Eczema herpeticum. The photo directly below it shows a healthcare worker who was wearing a tight mask that left a mark. The bottom left photo shows a child with chickenpox. The top left shows a girl who has a rash, which appears to be an irritation from wearing a mask and the bottom right photo shows a woman with a sensitive skin problem.In response to the claim that wearing a mask can cause serious lung infections and loss of consciousness, Dr. Emanuel Okunga, an epidemiologist at the Ministry of Health, told PesaCheck that this is untrue.“The face mask cannot compromise our health. It cannot weaken the lungs in any way as it protects the airways. A face mask protects against inhalation of all particles. The ability to protect against the inhalation of particles depends on the fit of the mask and its filtration rate.”Dr Okunga added it was important to handle masks with clean hands in order to avoid contaminating them.This view is also held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends that people remove face masks once they return home, and wash them before using them again.MedicalNewsToday, a health information website, fact-checked a similar claim and found there is no evidence indicating that masks increase the wearer’s risk of developing pneumonia or other bacterial, viral, or fungal lung infections.The World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges that if a person wears the same mask for a long time, microorganisms may grow on the fabric. Masks should be changed if wet or visibly soiled, and a wet mask should not be worn for an extended period of time. The mask should be discarded or placed in a resealable bag until it can be washed and dried.This is not the first social media post to claim that wearing masks is harmful to health. In May and July, PesaCheck debunked multiple allegations that wearing masks to prevent infection with COVID-19 can decrease oxygen intake, increase carbon dioxide inhalation, shut down the immune system and increase the risk of viral infection.PesaCheck also explained how effective and important wearing a mask is in the context of COVID-19.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that wearing a mask can cause serious lung infections and loss of consciousness due to restricted airflow and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The rates applied to all categories of tourists (local, residents, and international),” the organization stated in a tweet dated August 31.On July 1, 2020, Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala reduced the park entry fees to all KWS game parks and reserves by half for a period of one year, a move attributed to the economic crisis arising from the COVID 19 pandemic.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that KWS has raised park entry fees for Kenyans and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
239,Infrared thermometer guns do not affect the pineal gland,"An article claiming that infrared thermometers can cause damage to the pineal glands is FALSE.The article, published by Opera News, says no one should allow an infrared thermometer to be pointed at their forehead. They should, instead, insist on having their temperature taken at the wrist instead, to avoid any harm to the pineal gland. Resonating with this claim, several netizens took to Twitter to express the same.Non-contact infrared thermometers work by measuring the infrared radiation given off by any object, such as the human body, and converting this into a temperature reading. They have become a popular means of rapidly assessing body temperature for large populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the fact that they do not need direct contact with the body to give a temperature reading.As these devices measure infrared radiation rather than emitting it, the person whose temperature is being taken does not receive any radiation. The red light beaming from these devices helps the user to aim it correctly. Depending on the wavelength of the radiation received, it displays a higher or lower temperature.The pineal gland is a small part of the brain that produces and regulates hormones.Speaking to PesaCheck, Dr Lawrence Kyalo of Nairobi West Hospital stated that even if infrared rays were directed towards the pineal gland, it is located too deep in the brain for the radiation to reach it.“Light has a very low capacity to penetrate the barrier formed by the skull, even if infrared wavelengths penetrate more easily, we would have to cross the cranium completely to reach this small gland, which is located at the bottom of the brain,” he explains.According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal agency that regulates drugs in the United States, use of non-contact infrared thermometers is beneficial and reduces the risk of cross-contamination and minimizes the risk of spreading disease.PesaCheck has previously debunked other false claims that infrared thermometers can cause brain damage.PesaCheck has looked into a post claiming that infrared thermometers can cause damage to the pineal gland and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
240,HEADLINE: Scientists have not discovered a cure for HIV/AIDS,"An article published on the Opera News website claiming that scientists have finally discovered a cure for HIV/AIDS has a FALSE HEADLINE.The post claims that researchers from the University of Utah have discovered an injectable drug that is effective for prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.The drug, identified as CPT31, was tested in primates and proved effective in protecting cells from the virus, with human trials now set to begin, the article adds.“This is an exciting new HIV therapeutic option for both prevention and treatment, with a unique mechanism of action compared to other approved drugs,” Dr Michael Kay, a senior author of the study and a University of Utah professor of biochemistry, was quoted as saying.“It has great potential to help patients who suffer from drug resistance as well as those who would benefit from a longer-acting, injectable anti-HIV drug cocktail.”The article accurately conveys the announcement made on the University of Utah website. However, the claim made in the headline, that the drug can cure HIV/AIDS is not mentioned anywhere.Dr Kay clarifies that they still have a long way to go before such a claim can be made as the full course of human clinical trials and subsequent FDA approval could take several years.HIV/AIDS is a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which attacks the body’s immune system, specifically the white blood cells called CD4 cells. As the virus multiplies in the body, infection often progresses to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at which stage it interferes with the body’s ability to fight infections.While there is no cure for HIV infection, effective antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) can control the virus and help prevent transmission by 96 percent.Further, various clinical trials and research are being undertaken and several candidate vaccines have been developed since 1987 — some of which have successfully undergone Phase I and II trials — but have proved either ineffective or raise questions about their practicality.Over 38 million people in the world were believed to be living with HIV at the end of 2019. Since the first case of the infection was reported, the disease has grown to pandemic proportions, with an estimate of 32.7 million registered deaths from AIDS-related illnesses since the infection was discovered.PesaCheck has investigated an article claiming that scientists have discovered a cure for HIV/AIDs, and finds it has a FALSE HEADLINE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE
241,This video does not show a COVID-19 patient who was almost buried alive,"A Facebook post with a video claiming to show a COVID-19 patient nearly being buried alive is FALSE.The video shows a person being helped out of personal protective gear by others dressed the same way, while onlookers, including police officers, watch from a distance. The victim, who appears to be unresponsive, is later carried away.The post accompanying the video suggests that the incident demonstrates how the Ministry of Health has mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for its officials to resign. It further claims that the incident took place in Kipsigis.However, ‘Kipsigis’ is not a place. Rather it refers to a tribe in Kenya that predominantly lives in Kericho County, to the north-west of Nairobi.It is also unlikely that the person filmed being assisted in the video was meant to be buried, given the Ministry of Health’s guidelines for handling bodies of patients who succumbed to COVID-19, in order to minimise the risk of transmission.The guidelines prescribe that bodies should be double-bagged in leak-proof and tamper-proof body bags made of PVC.PVC is a solid plastic material that can be used for a variety of industrial, houseware, and medical devices.Additionally, while the said video has been widely shared on social media, no major media outlets have run a story of the alleged COVID-19 victim who was almost buried alive. Other accounts of the incident claim that it was a MOH official and a pallbearer who had fainted during the burial ceremony.Responding to queries from PesaCheck, Mr Ezra Kirui, the spokesperson for Bomet County government, stated that the claim is false and confirmed that the event took place on August 13, 2020, in Chesoen Village in Bomet County.“What happened is that our public health officers were doing internment of a COVID-19 case. But a member of the burial committee of the deceased requested to join the pallbearers, and therefore he was donned with PPEs and allowed to accompany the procession. He collapsed during the procession. The family members revealed that he had a history of seizures. A lack of oxygen supply in the PPE he was wearing could have triggered the seizures. He was attended to at Chesoen health centre and got back on his feet immediately,” Mr Kirui said.PesaCheck has looked into a video shared on Facebook with a post claiming that a COVID-19 patient was found to be alive moments before being buried, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
242,"Kirinyaga County Governor Anne Waiguru was not arrested on August 20, 2020","A tweet from Daily Mail Kenya claiming that Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru was arrested on August 20 over allegations of abuse of office and driven to Nairobi for interrogation is FALSE.On June 9, 2020, Governor Waiguru was impeached by the County Assembly of Kirinyaga, on grounds of an alleged violation of the constitution, abuse of office and gross misconduct.She appeared before a Senate Special Committee on June 23, as the final step to determine whether or not a governor’s impeachment is to be upheld as provided for by the Constitution of Kenya.On June 26, the Senate dismissed the accusations made by Kirinyaga MCAs as unsubstantiated and nullified Governor Waiguru’s impeachment.However, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) later raided Governor Waiguru’s home and offices on August 20 at Kagio village, Kirinyaga County.The EACC officers said that the Nyeri chief magistrate court had issued search warrants against the county boss and other staff with a view to retrieving information that may be useful to the agency’s investigation.A statement issued by EACC said the governor’s premises were ransacked as part of investigations regarding public funds amounting to KSh 23 million that was allegedly allocated as travel allowances for Ms Waiguru and other county officials.The statement does not mention the arrest of the governor or any Kirinyaga County official on August 20.Governor Waiguru also issued a press statement concerning the raid on August 20, but she did not include any information indicating that she had been arrested.Since the claim of her arrest on August 20, the governor has not been produced in any court as is required by law, which states that one has to be taken to court within 24 hours of being arrested.There have been no mainstream media reports or news footage indicating that the governor was arrested, as would be warranted by such a high-profile case.PesaCheck looked into the claim that Kirinyaga County Governor Anne Waiguru was arrested on August 20 and driven to Nairobi for interrogation over allegations of abuse of office and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
243,This video disputing the existence of COVID-19 as ‘ordinary fever’ is incorrect,"A video clip uploaded on YouTube in which Bishop David Oyedepo claims that COVID-19 is mere propaganda and that the virus is an ordinary fever is MISLEADING.The two-minute video shows the bishop of the Living Faith Church Worldwide making a presentation that was uploaded to YouTube on August 2, 2020, and is captioned, ‘Covid-19 is mere noise from Hell, it’s Ordinary fever’.In his sermon, the Nigerian preacher claims, in part, that the news about COVID-19 is “demonic propaganda” and that the virus is just “like [a] fever.“Every positive report contrary to that demonic propaganda is doused, is not allowed to have expression because of the evil machinations of the perpetrators,” the bishop says.COVID-19, known in full as ‘coronavirus disease 2019’, and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes it, were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the rapidly spreading outbreak a pandemic and a public health emergency of international concern.As of August 26, health agencies in 211 countries and territories have independently reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, corroborating the existence of the disease. Over 24 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwide, along with 16 million recoveries, and 825,825 deaths. Africa has recorded over 1.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 28,289 deaths cumulatively.Evidence is also growing that countries that responded quickly and implemented measures to counter the spread of COVID-19, including surveillance, quarantine, isolation and social distancing, use of face masks and school closures, have bee able to limit the transmission.In humans, the disease causes acute respiratory illness with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing.A number of global leaders, including Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, and Tanzanian President John Magufuli denied the existence of COVID-19, but they later changed their stance in the face of growing evidence of the severity of the disease, as well as the impact of the pandemic on their own countries.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that COVID-19 is mere propaganda and is like an ordinary fever, and finds it to be MISLEADING.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

246,Gas cylinders do not have expiry dates imprinted on them,"A post shared on Facebook claiming that liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders have codes indicating the expiry date of the cylinder printed on them is FALSE.The post further claims that if the gas cylinder is stored beyond this date, it may cause fire or an explosion.The post further states that the first part of the code uses the letters of the alphabet A, B, C and D to represent the four quarters of a year, with the letter A representing the first quarter, the months from January to March, B for the second quarter, and so on.The number indicated on the cylinder corresponds to a year, and the post claims that this indicates the year of expiry, adding that once the expiry date is passed, the cylinder becomes unsafe to keep in the house.A similar claim was posted on Twitter in 2019.However, this claim was debunked in 2016 by the Indian Oil Corporation, which stated that while the letters of the alphabet do represent the quarters of the year, there is no expiry date for LPG cylinders, and the letters and numbers used in the codes indicate the due date for cylinders to undergo testing or inspection.For instance, cylinders marked A 2017 (or A 17) were due for testing in the first quarter — between January and March — of 2017.‘Expiry’ refers to the shelf life of perishable products, and is the recommended time for safe storage and usage of such products within a given time frame, but in the case of LPG cylinders, the serviceability of the cylinders depends on external physical factors and actions such as temperature, pressure, exposure to atmospheric conditions, usage, impact, and load, among others. As such, there is no expiry date for LPG cylinders, the statement read.Mr Edwin Irungu, who works in the petroleum gas department at the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA), concurs with this position.Speaking to PesaCheck, Mr Irungu explained that gas cylinders undergo inspections to make sure they conform to set safety standards.He added that in Kenya, cylinders go through an eight-year cycle of use before they are due for a safety inspection.Despite these safety checks, Mr Irungu cautioned that consumers still need to handle gas cylinders carefully in their homes to ensure that the gas regulator is fitted correctly to the valve and that the regulator, hose and household appliances that use gas, such as cookers and ovens, are in good condition.Pesa Check has previously debunked a claim that gas cylinders can explode if shaken, and found it to be false as well.PesaCheck looked into the claim that LPG cylinders have coded expiry dates imprinted on them, and, if stored in the house beyond this date may cause a fire or an explosion and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

250,The World Health Organization has not voiced opposition to Kenya’s community-based learning plan,"A Facebook post claiming that the World Health Organization (WHO) has opposed the rollout of a community-based learning program by the Ministry of Education in Kenya is FALSE.According to the post, Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha is “at crossroads” following the WHO’s supposed announcement.The Education CS has urged teachers to enrol for the community-based learning programme. Community-based learning is meant to keep learners engaged in their studies after schools were closed in March as a measure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.The nationwide programme is a joint effort by the Education Ministry, the Teachers’ Service Commission (TSC) — the employer of teaching staff — and the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government.The programme is meant to complement the ongoing remote learning programme offered by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) and specifically targets students who are unable to access KICD teaching while they wait for the reopening of schools.While the WHO and UNICEF have jointly urged governments to accelerate the safe reopening of schools, they have not rejected community-based learning outright.In a press release dated August 13, UNICEF executive director, Henrietta Fore, said the closure of schools following the coronavirus crisis has affected children’s education and wellbeing.“We must prioritize children’s learning. This means making sure that schools are safe to reopen — including with access to hand hygiene, clean drinking water, and safe sanitation.”The two United Nations agencies also published a Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) report showing that global school closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected up to 1.6 billion children.The report builds on guidelines for the safe reopening of schools issued by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Bank on April 30.The guidelines include the need to craft clear policies for school operations during public health emergencies and to address the impact of COVID-19 on education. They also highlight issues of disease transmission, compensation for lost instructional time, focus on students’ well-being and expanded access for children who were previously out-of-school.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the WHO has opposed the rollout of a community-based learning programme by the Ministry of Education in Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

In the end, Nigeria led the poll results.According to the World Bank, Africa’s largest economies are Nigeria, South Africa, and Angola.On April 9, a World Bank report stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had triggered an economic recession in sub-Saharan Africa for the first time in 25 years and called for policies to support resilience.PesaCheck has looked into an article published by Opera News claiming that CNN has named Kenya as the likely leading economy in Africa in the next 20 years and finds it to be MISLEADING.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The tweet, posted on August 19, 2020, is captioned in part, “Malian President and Prime Minister trying to climb the State House gate and flee”. The tweet appears to warn Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga about the likely consequences of a popular uprising, as was seen in Mali.However, a Google reverse image search shows that the images are from 2014, and show Nigeria’s deputy minority leader of the House of Representatives, Kawu Sumaila, in the first image, and National Assembly member, Abdulmalik Usman Cheche, in the second jumping over a railing at the National Assembly of Nigeria, known as NASS.Police had blocked the lawmakers from accessing the National Assembly complex after they disagreed with a decision by President Goodluck Jonathan.President Jonathan had sought approval from the assembly to extend emergency rule to three north-eastern states of Yobe, Borno, and Adamawa, due to insecurity. Lawmakers had declined the request, saying the initial state of emergency had worsened the situation.Dr Miguna’s post suggested that the images were related to the ouster of the Malian government on August 18, when soldiers, who had formed a group called the National Committee for the Salvation of the People, stormed Malian presidential palace.The soldiers arrested President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta and Prime Minister Boubou Cissé, and detained the president’s son, the Speaker of the National Assembly, the foreign and finance ministers, among the other government officials.This was after the soldiers joined citizens who had gathered in the capital, Bamako to demand President Keïta’s resignation over allegations of widespread corruption, mismanagement of the economy, and insecurity.Mali had also seen anti-government demonstrators led by conservative cleric Imam Mahmoud Dicko calling on the president to step down.President Keïta resigned on August 19, 2020, and dissolved his government and the National Assembly.PesaCheck has looked into the tweet claiming to show Mali’s president and prime minister trying to flee the presidential palace and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

Dr Rebecca Powell, an infectious disease expert at the Icahn School of Medicine, has put out a call for samples of breast milk to test for the presence of coronavirus antibodies and assess their potential ability to combat disease.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has not been detected in breast milk, meaning that there is no known risk of an infected mother passing it to a child through milk.At the moment, there are no vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials across the world evaluating potential treatments.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that breast milk provides antibodies that fight the virus that causes COVID-19 and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The form lists 14 positions to be filled in various Naivas stores across the country, offering a salary of KSh 30,000 and above.The form also claims that there are 83 Naivas branches in Kenya while the retailer says there are currently 65 Naivas stores, with the latest addition being one at Mega City shopping mall in Kisumu.The second page of the application form instructs candidates to send a fee of KSh 370 to an M-Pesa account rather than through a paybill number, promising those who are not shortlisted for jobs that their fee will be refunded. The post claims that the funds are being sent to Enock Cheruiyot, and that Enock is the Human Resource Manager at Naivas.Responding to concerns raised on Twitter over a similar post, Naivas stated that it was not responsible for the job advertisement.The supermarket chain routinely announces its initiatives and programs via its Twitter and Facebook pages, as well as on its website.The alleged 400 vacancies advertised on the Facebook post are not mentioned on any of Naivas’s official platforms.This is not the first time PesaCheck has debunked claims where the Naivas brand has been used in fraudulent job recruitment processes.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook page advertising 400 job opportunities at Naivas Supermarket and finds it to be a HOAX.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:
256,half of Kenya’s workforce unemployed?,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world economy to a near standstill, thanks in part to restrictions on movement that have limited the production and consumption of goods and services, as well as the redirection of resources away from economic activity and towards mitigation measures meant to contain the spread of the disease.An April 2020 statement from the International Labour Organization said full or partial lockdown measures were already affecting almost 2.7 billion workers or around 81 percent of the global workforce.Lockdowns are designed to slow the spread of the virus by limiting human movement and to relieve overwhelmed health care systems handling unprecedented numbers of critically ill people. However, these measures have disastrous implications for the labour force, and are projected to worsen unemployment in ways that will take a while to recover from.When Kenya reported its first positive COVID-19 case on March 12, 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta asked citizens to work from home to avoid crowded situations that could spread the deadly disease.The call to work from home caught the attention of Dr Miguna Miguna, a relentless critic of President Kenyatta’s administration, who claimed in a tweet that over 55 percent of Kenyans are unemployed.In the tweet, which got more than 1,000 reactions, Dr Miguna added that the majority of those employed work in the jua kali industry, on flower farms and in hotels, raising the question of how the unemployed or those in informal employment can work at home when the nature of their job requires their physical presence in the workplace.So, the question is, is it true that over 55 percent of Kenyans are unemployed?PesaCheck looked into the claim and found it to be FALSE, based on the following reasons:Although Kenya faces the challenge of a youth bulge, unemployment among its youthful population has not jumped to over 50 percent. Data from the World Bank shows that in 2019, youth unemployment for Kenyans aged between 15 and 24 was 18.3 percent.The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics’ Quarterly Labor Force Report for the fourth quarter of 2019, shows that youth aged 20 to 24 make up the highest proportion of the unemployed at 14.2 percent, while the unemployment rate for adults aged 60 to 64 years was negligible.The KNBS Quarterly Report for the second quarter of 2020 shows that the unemployment rate was 13.7 percent, having increased from the 12.4 percent recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019.Youth unemployment accounts for the highest rate of labor underutilization recorded in the age groups of 20–24, followed by those aged 15 to 19. These age groups constitute the largest percentage of Kenya’s population which now stands at 47.6 million based on the 2019 Population and Housing Census results.A 2017 study, supported by UKaid, placed Kenya’s unemployment among young people (aged 15 to 24) at 22 percent in 2016. While the combined unemployment rate was about 11 percent in 2016, the data was based on estimates by the International Labour Organization (ILO).Data from the World Bank shows that Kenya’s unemployment rate is high among young people. It also shows evidence of slow-paced deceleration in the rate of youth unemployment.The above data shows that youth unemployment remains high despite a wide difference in estimates given by various institutions. However, the combined unemployment rate in Kenya is estimated at 10 percent while that among youth is estimated to be above 15 percent although some reports place it as high as 22 percent.While unemployment is of major concern in Kenya, with some estimates putting it above 20 percent, there is no data supporting Dr Miguna Miguna’s claim that 55% of Kenyans are unemployed, making it FALSE.",Is
257,Okra is not a cure for Type 2 diabetes,"A Facebook post claiming that okra extract can cure Type 2 diabetes is FALSE.According to the post, the extract is prepared by cutting off the ends of the edible seed pods, and leaving the pods to soak in a cup with water overnight.The post adds that the okra pods should be removed from the cup the following day, leaving the water, which should be drunk consistently to “make diabetes disappear”.The author also invites people to join a ‘natural health class’ on WhatsApp and learn how to make medical cures using roots, leaves and stems instead of “spending millions in the hospital.”The post adds that the classes would teach about cures for diseases and ailments ranging from arthritis to gonorrhoea, asthma, stroke, HIV and fibroids, and appears to be a marketing scheme for these classes.Okra is rich in dietary fiber, and has been shown to improve the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar. However, the claim exaggerates the medicinal value of this vegetable and its extract in the treatment of diabetes, which occurs when the body is unable to effectively regulate blood sugar levels.A 2014 study by the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine’s School of Pharmacy published in PubMed found that okra and its extracts can reduce blood glucose and serum insulin levels, as well as improve glucose tolerance in obese mice.Another joint study by three Bangladeshi Universities (Southeast University, University of Rajshahi and University of Asia Pacific) and published by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in 2011, found reduced absorption of glucose in the digestive tract in rats, indicating that consuming okra could lead to a more stable blood sugar response.While the antidiabetic properties of okra has been demonstrated in rodents, clinical trials are needed to prove its efficacy as a cure for diabetes in human beings.Additionally, the study by the US NCBI cautions against consuming okra concurrently with metformin hydrochloride, a treatment used for Type 2 diabetes, as absorption of the medicine was found to be hampered.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the extract from okra can cure Type 2 diabetes, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

He did not specifically mention tertiary institutions in his presentation.Additionally, the screenshot has grammatical errors, which would be unlikely in communication from an official account.A Google search found the original tweet and the account from which the post was sent. The account with the handle @profGmagoha states on its profile that it’s a parody and tweets are “pun intended”.However, the account name doesn’t follow the twitter requirement for creating parody accounts, which stipulate that the account should clearly indicate that the user is not affiliated with the subject of the account.CS Magoha does not have an official Twitter account.PesaCheck has looked into the screenshot posted on Facebook showing a tweet that appears to be made by Kenya’s Education CS George Magoha, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
259,This post promoting Plandemic: Indoctornation with claims about COVID-19 is misleading,"An Instagram post claiming that philanthropists Bill Gates and Geroge Soros, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Dr Anthony Fauci and others conspired to create the COVID-19 pandemic is FALSE.The post, shared by former media personality Jamila Mbugua, contains text with these claims, alongside an invitation to the livestream premiere of the documentary, Plandemic: Indoctornation, by LondonReal.The film, which premiered on August 18, 2020, argues that the COVID-19 pandemic was planned and that the virus was developed in a lab.The film suggests that there is an agenda behind the race to develop vaccines to counter the virus and questions the role of the mainstream media, Mr Gates, the WHO and its Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Dr Fauci — who is the director of the US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases in advancing this.The post also links billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros and Mr Tedros — who previously served as a board member of Gavi, the vaccine alliance funded by Bill Gates — to the conspiracy.However, the claim that the virus that causes COVID-19 was created in a lab and does not have a natural origin has been strongly dismissed by the scientific community.“Scientists from multiple countries have published and analyzed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)”, a statement by a number of public health scientists published by the Lancet on February 19, 2020 reads, adding, “This coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens.”PesaCheck has previously looked into this claim and found it to be false.The post also argues that Kenya, through a deal signed by President Uhuru Kenyatta with Gavi in June 2020, is now part of the conspiracy since it pledged full support for Gavi campaigns.However, the speech by President Kenyatta during the global Gavi summit in May 2020, stated that Kenya’s partnership with Gavi spans 20 years and did not begin in June this year as the post claims.The post also suggests that hospitals are “combining pneumonia and flu cases to increase COVID-19 numbers”.A look at the CDC’s provisional death count for COVID-19 providing details of the causes of death shows this is not true, another claim that PesaCheck has previously debunked.The author of the post also alleges that doctors who claim to have cures for COVID-19 are being censored, including American-based Dr Stella Immanuel who recently claimed that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine cures the disease.The post accuses Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram of banning content that promotes claims advanced in the documentary and urges people not to allow their thinking to be manipulated.Social media companies have reportedly sought to limit the spread of the documentary by flagging the link for violating misinformation policiesThe founder of LondonReal, YouTuber Brian Rose, has previously been accused of using the COVID-19 pandemic to scam followers of his platform, which hosts the video Plandemic: Indoctrination and promotes itself as a channel for ‘free speech’.In April 2020, YouTube took down a live-streamed interview of Mr Rose with conspiracy theorist David Icke, who claims that COVID-19 does not exist and linked it to 5G technology — another theory that has been debunked as a myth.Mr Icke had his Facebook page and YouTube channel removed in May 2020, for posting misleading information.PesaCheck has looked into a post that claims billionaire philanthropists Bill Gates and Geroge Soros along with the WHO, Dr Fauci and other prominent individuals conspired to create the COVID-19 pandemic, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

However, the article itself only speaks about the arrest of Bomet Senator Christopher Lang’at.Senator Murkomen was actually present in Parliament and even contributed to the Senate discussions.The special seating held on August 17 was called to debate a proposal on the Revenue Allocations Bill sponsored by nominated Senator Petronila Were.Three senators opposed to the Bill — Cleophas Malala of Kakamega, Christopher Lang’at of Bomet and Steve Lelegwe of Samburu — were arrested and later released. Senator Lelelgwe claimed the arrest was linked to his stand on the Bill.Ms Were’s amendment to the House Finance Committee report sought to retain the controversial third basis formula for revenue allocation among counties proposed by the Commission on Revenue Allocation but proposed to increase the kitty from the current Kshs 316.5 billion to Kshs 348 billion. Senators opposed to the formula say some marginalised counties would get less funding under the proposal.To determine the parameters for the third basis, CRA developed criteria for sharing revenue among the 47 counties, and these are health index (17 % weight), agriculture (10%), population (18%), poverty (14%), basic share (20%), land area (8%), rural access (4%), urban households (5%), fiscal effort (2%) and prudence index (2%).After members failed to agree on a working formula for revenue allocation for the ninth time, the Senate adjourned.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Murkomen was arrested before the Senate hosted a special sitting to discuss the County Revenue Allocations Bill and finds it to have a FALSE HEADLINE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE

It does not indicate who at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations made this statement.Dennis Okari’s two-part investigative piece, which aired on August 16, looked into the handling of money and donations allocated to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, funds which Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA) and the Ministry of Health allegedly could not account for.The story also exposed how well-connected individuals flouted procurement procedures in the supply of personal protective equipment (PPEs), which were acquired at inflated prices.However, the 254News.Live article does not give any further information on Mr Okari’s supposed arrest, where he was taken into custody, or when he will be arraigned in court.Instead, it lists some of the companies that were mentioned in the exposé as having benefited from the irregular supply of PPEs.The DCI has not made any pronouncement on the arrest, nor has this information been posted on the official Facebook and Twitter accounts of the Directorate.Additionally, there have been no reports of Mr Okari’s arrest on any other media outlets, including on NTV Kenya, where he works.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that NTV Kenya investigative journalist Dennis Okari has been arrested over an investigative story over the theft and misappropriation of funds meant to pay for COVID-19 response supplies, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The inspection is aimed at assessing the preparedness of the institutions that were to resume operations in September 2020.The CS has since ruled out the possibility of reopening learning institutions, saying they have not fully complied with the COVID-19 safety protocols.Additionally, the community-based learning program referenced in the article has nothing to do with institutions of higher learning. Rather it targets basic education learning institutions, which according to the Ministry of Education, will resume operations in January 2021.Community-based learning will see teachers engage learners in their immediate environment in productive activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they await the resumption of normal school activities.The program will be offered at no cost and is a joint effort between the Ministry of Education, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), local chiefs and the Nyumba Kumi Initiative.Prof Magoha has reiterated that schools will reopen in January unless otherwise advised.“Should conditions change, according to the advice from the Ministry of Health, then something else will happen. But nevertheless, the government is in the process of inspecting all schools and ensuring that they are capable of complying with the COVID-19 regulations,” he told a press conference on August 7.Prof Magoha rejected Mr Wambugu’s request to have Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) candidates resume learning, saying it was not safe to go back to school.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Education Cabinet Secretary George Magohs has directed learning to resume in September, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

267,President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Madaraka Day speech,"During an address to the nation on June 1, 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta laid out his legacy in his official speech that pointed out government achievements since he took office in April 2013.The president spoke at State House, Nairobi, where he led the nation in marking the 57th Madaraka Day, commemorating the anniversary of when Kenya attained internal self-governance in 1963.From the address, PesaCheck looked at six claims made by the president and found the following:Claim 1: The founding fathers built an extra 11,200 kilometers (km) of tarmacked roads after independence at an average of 224 km per year.Verdict: FALSEWhen the first president of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, left office in 1978, the country had 4,330 km of paved roads, as per the Statistical Abstract published in 1978.According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Ministry of Planning and National Development, the country had 8,937 km of paved road when the late President Daniel Moi left office in 2002. President Moi’s 24-year rule saw 4,607 km built, which is an average of 192 km a year.Mwai Kibaki, the third president, was in office from 2003 to 2013. During his term, the country’s paved road network increased from 8,937 km to 11,230 km. This was an extra 2,293 km, or an average of 229 km built each year.President Uhuru Kenyatta used the 11,230 km as the baseline for his 2013 election manifesto. However, that figure includes paved roads built before independence.From 1963 to 2013, in the 50 years of Kenya’s first three presidents, the country’s paved road network increased by 9,441 km, and not by the 11,200 km that President Uhuru Kenyatta mentioned in his statement, making the claim FALSE.Claim 2: The administration of President Uhuru Kenyatta has built 1,000 km of tarmacked roads every year — more than four times what the first three administrations built on average per year.VERDICT: PLAUSIBLEAfter taking office in 2013, President Kenyatta promised to extend the total length of Kenya’s paved road network from 11,000 kilometers to 24,000 kilometers in his first five years in office.When seeking re-election in 2017, he acknowledged that only 1,950 km of road had been built, with a renewed promise that 7,000 kilometres that was still under construction at the time would be completed.Figures published in the 2018 Economic Survey show that Kenya had 20,600 km of tarmacked roads in 2017.A January 2018 report by the National Treasury showed that between the financial year 2013/2014 and 2016/2017, some 1,659 km of road was built.Given that the paved road network increased by 9,441 kilometres under the first three presidents, that translates to an average construction of 189 km per year. According to the Treasury report, President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration built 1,659 km of road during his first term, which is almost four times what the previous administration did in a year, making the claim PLAUSIBLE.Claim 3: 6 million title deeds were issued by 2013 when President Kenyatta assumed officeVerdict: MOSTLY TRUEOver 10.08 million title deeds have been processed since independence, according to the Ministry of Lands. In the first 50 years after independence, a total of 5,600,000 title deeds had been processed. The number of title deeds processed by end of the 2012/13 Financial Year (FY) were 345,091, making the total number of title deeds processed from independence to FY 2012/13 5,945,091.This number is short of 54,909 title deeds from the number the president quoted. It appears the 5.95 million figure was rounded off to 6 million title deeds.This makes the claim by the president that by 2013, there were 6 million title deeds issued MOSTLY TRUE.Claim 4: In only seven years, 4.5 million title deeds have been issued under my administrationVerdict: MOSTLY TRUEAccording to the Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning website, the government has issued 4,500,000 titles deeds over the 6-year period from 2013 to 2019. However, data obtained from the same ministry shows about 4.48 million deeds were issued from 2013 to April 2020 (7-year period). There is a 12,434 difference between the number quoted by the president and the ministry’s website. Again, it appears that the figure was rounded off.Between 2013 to 2017, over 3.21 million titles were issued, while over 1.26 million deeds were issued between 2018 and April 2020.This makes the claim by the president that in only seven years, the administration has issued 4.5 million title deeds MOSTLY TRUE.Claim 5: The administration of President Uhuru Kenyatta has connected 99 percent of public schools to electricityVerdict: FALSEElectrification of public schools is a shared responsibility between the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) and Kenya Power.According to REREC’s 2016–2021 strategic plan, 6,530 public secondary schools had been electrified by June 2013, when President Kenyatta’s administration started its first full financial year.REREC then turned its focus to public primary schools to support the new government’s digital learning plan. By June 2016, a total of 8,259 public secondary schools, and 22,648 of the targeted 23,401 public primary schools were connected, according to the strategic plan.According to KNBS data, the total number of public primary schools as of April 27, 2020 is at 23,286, making the connection in public primary schools almost 99%.The president’s figure would, therefore, have been accurate if he were referring only to public primary schools. Before his administration, 6,530 public secondary schools had already been connected, so he cannot take credit for them, making his claim FALSE.Claim 6: In just 7 years of Uhuru’s presidency, close to 3.5 million households have been connected to the power grid, bringing the number of households connected close to 8 million.Verdict: TRUEThe country’s 2019 census found there were 12.1 million households in Kenya. President Kenyatta’s figure of “close to 8 million” suggests about two-thirds of Kenyan households are connected to electricity.But the census showed access to grid electricity was 50.4 percent in 2019. Another 19.3 percent had access through solar. This is more than two-thirds, but it is not clear how much off-grid access was made available by the state.In June 2013, when the first full financial year that President Kenyatta can take credit for began, total connections were about 2.8 million, of which 2.2 million were domestic. By 2017, connections were at 6.1 million customers.Treasury data shows there were 7.2 million connections as of June 2019, but does not give a figure for domestic connections.Kenya Power says this had risen to 7.5 million customers as of January 2020, but does not specify how many were domestic connections. The last publicly available figure for domestic connections was 6.8 million in June 2018.",Fact-checking

270,These images of police brutality in Zimbabwe are not from 2020,"A tweet with images claiming to show incidents of police brutality during ongoing anti-government protests in Zimbabwe is FALSE.The tweet comes as reports of unrest in the southern African country gain global traction online, with photos circulating on social media under the hashtag #ZimbabweanLivesMatter.In July 2020, Zimbabweans took to the streets to protest over challenges facing the country, including corruption and an economic crisis that is reported to have recorded an inflation rate of over 700 percent.One major protest was slated for July 31, and the government reportedly beefed up security, deploying armed officers to different parts of the country. Though the protest did not happen as planned, police arrested individuals who tried to hold low-key protests on the same day.However, a Google reverse image search of the first photo reveals that it was taken in Harare in 2016, during a demonstration by minibus drivers against police harassment. The image was published by the Associated Press (AP) on July 4, 2016.The second image of a woman in white running as a police officer kicks at her, is also not from the July 2020 protests.The photo records events from November 2019, when Zimbabwean policemen were dispersing a crowd that had gathered to attend a meeting called by opposition leader Nelson Chamisa.A reverse image search of the third photo, which shows a woman on her knees with hands raised while an officer kicks her, was published in September 2016. The photo was published alongside an article by the Zimbabwe Independent, which stated that the incident took place at the Harare Magistrates’ Court.A Google reverse image search of the last image of two soldiers beating a person lying on the ground was first shared online in August 2018.The image was published alongside an article by Voice of America and another article published by AfricaFeeds on protests following the July 2018 election in Zimbabwe.

271,Russia has granted regulatory approval for a possible COVID-19 vaccine,"An article claiming that Russia is the first country to approve a possible COVID-19 vaccine is TRUE.The article, published by news blog OMGVOICE, says that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin granted regulatory approval for the vaccine after less than two months of human testing.The vaccine has been developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow.On Tuesday, August 11, Russia’s Ministry of Health said it had approved the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine.President Putin told a meeting of government officials that the vaccine “works effectively enough” and that it had been tried on his own daughter.However, there has been criticism of this approval, as the vaccine has not undergone the critical late-stage clinical trials to determine its safety and effectiveness.Scientists from across the globe have denounced the approval as premature and inappropriate, stating that the Gamaleya vaccine was yet to be tested to convincingly show that it is safe and effective for large groups of people.Phase III trials are critical for drug and vaccine development, and Dr Daniel Salmon, the director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, was quoted by both CNBC and the New York Times as saying that this trial phase determines if a vaccine works and what potential side effects it could have on the general public.Given that the vaccine has not undergone the Phase III stage of trials, Dr Salmon stated that the safety and effectiveness of the Gamaleya vaccine were in question.There are at least three phases to clinical trials. Occasionally, a fourth phase may be necessary if scientists think a vaccine or medicine can be improved.According to the WHO, more than 150 countries are involved in vaccine trials including Russia, with 29 vaccine candidates already undergoing human trials.More than 20 million people worldwide have tested positive for COVID-19, with at least 737,000 fatalities as of August 12 according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Russia is the first country in the world to grant approval for a possible COVID-19 vaccine and finds it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:

The crowds that turned out to welcome the president disregarded social distancing protocols that are currently in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.However, there are still active cases of COVID-19 in Kenya, and government spokesperson Colonel (Rtd) Cyrus Oguna has stated that that the president did not claim that the country is free from the disease.“President Uhuru has not declared Kenya COVID-19 free, the government is committed to the fight against the pandemic and at the moment. We are still registering cases as a country,” Colonel Oguna said.Additionally, there is no evidence of this claim on Presidency website, the State House Twitter account, and on mainstream media in the country, and given the potential implications of such a statement, it is unlikely that it would have gone unreported if the president had indeed declared Kenya ‘COVID-19 free’.PesaCheck has looked into a tweet claiming that President Uhuru Kenyatta has declared Kenya COVID-19 free and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The original restrictions locked out anyone younger than 13 or over 58 years; this has now been expanded to allow worshippers aged from 6 to 65 years.These revised safety guidelines are specifically for places of worship in Kenya in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and are set to take effect on August 18.The article then describes the announcement by the Interfaith Council ID-19 as a great relief for teachers aged over 58, whom the author adds ‘feared would be sent to early retirement’ if the Ministry of Education were to replicate the previous directive by the Ministry of Health to worshippers.PesaCheck has looked into an article by content aggregating site Opera News and claiming that the retirement age of teachers in Kenya has been increased, and finds it has a FALSE HEADLINE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE
274,Education CS Prof Magoha did not announce a ban on boarding schools starting in 2021,"An article published by content aggregating website Opera News claiming that Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha announced there will be no more boarding schools in 2021 is FALSE.According to the article, the CS said the move would be in the best interest learners, citing congestion in boarding schools, along with lack of clean water and inadequate medical facilities as some of the factors contributing to the decision.The article making the claim refers to comments made by Prof Magoha during a virtual meeting he held with the National Assembly Education Committee on August 6. The meeting outlined the ministry’s roadmap for the resumption of learning activities following the closure of schools in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Prof Magoha stated that boarding schools presented a challenge in terms of adequate containment measures and the need for social distancing, given the close proximity and number of students. However, he did not state that boarding schools would be banned outright as claimed.“Futuristically, we shall focus mainly on day schools. It will be difficult maintaining social distance in the cubicle of eight learners,” Prof Magoha is quoted as saying by a news report from the event carried by The Star newspaper, in an apparent reference to the crowding in school dormitories.In an email response to PesaCheck’s query on the matter, Kennedy Buhere, the communication officer at the Ministry of Education, clarified that the CS’s remarks to the effect that the ministry will abolish boarding schools in January 2021 were taken out of context.“All he told the National Assembly’s Committee on Education and Research was that boarding schools may present a particular challenge if prevalence and spread of COVID-19 remain as it is now or worsens,” said Mr Buhere.Mr Buhere added that the cabinet secretary raised the likelihood of a ban to enable the members of the National Assembly to appreciate the complexity of the situation the ministry will be faced with should COVID-19 infection rates continue into January 2021.Some of the other issues that were highlighted during the meeting include the release of government funds to cater for salaries of school boards, teachers and subordinate employees and the fact that the ministry has asked for more funding from the Treasury to equip schools ahead of the scheduled reopening in January.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha announced that there would be a ban on boarding schools in Kenya starting in 2021, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

We checked and found that the post contains a mixture of true and false information.Hyesan, North KoreaMedia reports indicate that an LPG gas explosion occurred in North Korea on Monday, August 3.The Associated Press (AP) also posted a video of the Hyesan fire on August 6. Voice of America also shared the video, which AP said was obtained from a Chinese travel agent who had previously visited Hyesan.The travel agent said he shot it from a park in Changbai and that the blast had occurred near Hyesan’s orphanage and tourism office.However, both the North Korean and South Korean authorities have not confirmed that fire broke out in Hyesan, making it hard to verify the authenticity of the claim.Wuhan, ChinaAn explosion occurred at a chemical factory in China’s Hubei province on Monday, August 3.Video footage of the explosion was captured not in Wuhan as indicated on the image, but in Xiantao, a neighbouring city, shows thick black smoke rising out of a building and into the sky.South China Morning Post reported that at least six people were killed and four injured during the explosion. The factory has been suspended for rectification and the incident is being investigated, according to local reports.The image posted is thus MISLEADING as the explosion occurred in Xiantao and not Wuhan as claimed.United Arab EmiratesAccording to the National UAE, a news outlet in the United Arab Emirates, a fire broke out at a local market in Ajman on Wednesday, August 5.No casualties were reported as the market had been shut down for several months because of COVID-19 and a nearby medical center was evacuated as a precaution once the smoke became visible. The fire was brought under control once local authorities arrived.The state-operated Emirates News Agency reported that the cause of the fire is still unknown but the government has started investigations.Our research shows that the claim that there was a fire in a market in the UAE on August 5 is TRUE.Najaf, IraqArabian media outlets reported that a fire broke out in Najaf city in Iraq on Wednesday, August 5.“According to the correspondent of the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) in Najaf Ashraf … the food and electrical storages of ‘Al Quds’ in the south of the province caught fire,” reported news association Shafaqna.Based on the fact that the Najaf fire has been reported by several media outlets, it is TRUE that the fire actually occurred.St. Paul, MinnesotaOn August 4, ABC News reported that a huge fire occurred at the Seven Corners Gateway site, an apartment building and hotel complex construction in downtown Minnesota.There were no casualties reported and the cause of the fire is yet to be established, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said, while promising to investigate the incident.However, the image used in the Facebook post does appear to be a screenshot of footage taken of the incident, making the post MISLEADING.PesaCheck has looked into a post showing images from explosions and fires that are alleged to have occurred within the same 24-hour timeframe of the Beirut port explosion and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.Our research shows that some of these events did not occur within the period claimed but happened at different times between Monday, August 3, and Wednesday, August 5.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",PARTLY

The gazette notices published on July 24, the date on the image, were Numbers 142 and 144.In July, the Ministry of Health suggested banning the sale of alcohol to sit-in customers in business establishments in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.The Ministry also proposed that businesses where alcohol is sold operate between 9 am and 7.30 pm, with stiff penalties if found breaking the rules. However, the initiative is still at the consultation stage.On July 27, President Uhuru Kenyatta issued an executive order to ban the sale of alcohol in eateries and restaurants, as well as extending the ban on bars from operating by 30 days. This was among measures taken to slow down the rising rate of COVID-19 transmission in the country.However, on August 5, Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala clarified that lodges, hotels and resorts that offer accommodation are allowed to sell alcohol to checked-in customers and only in their hotel rooms.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Ministry of Health has gazetted guidelines prohibiting the sale of alcoholic drinks and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The instructions on the page indicate that the loan will be sent directly to the borrower by mobile money.To qualify, the borrower must be over 18 years and have a mobile money service account such as M-Pesa or Airtel, which has been active for at least two months.A registration fee of KSh 370 is part of the application process and a personal number to which the money should be sent is included in the instructions, with a promise that the money will be refunded to unsuccessful applicants.After paying the fee, the applicant is required to enter the mobile money transaction code along with other personal details into the registration form provided and indicate how much they want to borrow.Once the loan request is submitted, a pop-up message appears alerting the borrower that the application has been sent and a customer service representative will contact them within 10 minutes.However, Equity Bank told PesaCheck that their loans are offered via their branded banking applications, and asked customers to be vigilant.“Our loans are offered via Equitel and our Eazzy Banking App. Kindly be vigilant and don’t share your account information,” a representative from Equity Bank said.To qualify for an Equitel loan the applicant must have an Equity Bank account or an Equitel line that has been active for a minimum of six months.A WhoIs search of the registration details for the website eazy254.website indicates it was registered on July 20.

287,Kenya has not sent Raila Odinga to Tanzania to negotiate in a feud between the two countries,"An article claiming that Kenya has sent ODM leader Raila Odinga to Tanzania to negotiate with President John Magufuli over the escalating feud between the two countries linked to the COVID-19 pandemic is FALSE.The article by Kenya Today says the move was prompted by Tanzania banning Kenya Airways flights after Tanzania was excluded from the list of nations whose flights would be allowed entry to Kenya.Tanzania banned Kenya’s national airline from entering the country effective August 1 in a deepening row seemingly triggered by Tanzania’s controversial handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.President Magufuli’s refusal to impose stringent measures and a decision to halt the release of statistics on COVID-19 infections since April this year have caused concern among Tanzania’s neighbors, including Kenya.Tanzania’s Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement that Kenya Airways flights were being banned “on a reciprocal basis”. The action followed Kenya’s exclusion of Tanzania from the list of countries of origin whose passengers would be allowed to enter Kenya when commercial flights resumed on August 1.However, Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia confirmed to PesaCheck that Kenya Airways was later allowed to resume flights to Tanzania after talks between the country’s transport ministers, rescinding the decision by TCAA.But Raila Odinga’s personal assistant Dennis Onyango told PesaCheck in a phone interview that the former prime minister has not left the country for such an assignment.“Mr Odinga has not traveled to Tanzania.

288,This combination of home remedies does not cure COVID-19,"An article published by content aggregation site Opera News claiming that consuming a mixture of three home remedies can cure and prevent COVID-19 is FALSE.The first of the three remedies combines lemon and bicarbonate of soda, and the claim is that drinking this mixture alkalizes the immune system, killing the COVID-19 virus and completely eliminating it from the body.PesaCheck has previously debunked the claim that consuming alkaline foods can treat COVID-19. Additionally, altering the pH of the body can result in metabolic alkalosis, a serious disorder which occurs when the blood pH rises above 7.45, requiring medical intervention.Additionally, the article claims that when night falls, the immune system becomes acidic even though acidosis is a medical disorder occasioned by excess acidity in the body and when blood pH falls below 7.35. Rather than take place during night falls as claimed by the article, the common causes of acidosis include consumption of substances that are metabolized to acids, decreased acid excretion and increased excretion of base. Just like metabolic alkalosis, acidosis requires medical intervention.The second home remedy mentioned in the article combines garlic, which can either be boiled or eaten raw, with lemon.However, while garlic has health benefits, including some antimicrobial properties, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that there is no evidence that eating it has protected people from COVID-19.PesaCheck has previously debunked a claim that a mixture of lemon and ginger can cure COVID-19.The third remedy suggested by the article is steaming. This is done by filling a bucket with boiling water, adding Vicks, and inhaling the steam from the bucket for 5–10 minutes while covered in a blanket.While there are claims that steam therapy provides temporary relief from coughs and decongests the nasal passages, there is little scientific evidence to support this, and the WHO does not list it as one of the ways to protect or treat COVID-19.Vicks VapoRub is a mentholated ointment manufactured by Procter & Gamble. Product usage instructions indicate that a thick layer of the ointment should be rubbed on the throat and chest and covered with a warm, dry cloth if desired, and not as a steaming agent as described in the article.Additionally, the user instructions on Vicks VapoRub do not list COVID-19 as one of the ailments that it can cure, and claims that it can improve circulation, lower blood pressure, and lead to a healthier heart as claimed in the article are also unfounded.The WHO has maintained that some home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID -19, but there are currently no approved cures, and the organization does not recommend self-medication.The WHO recommends protecting oneself and others from the disease by frequent hand washing, avoiding touching the eyes, coughing into a tissue or the crook of a bent elbow, and maintaining an interpersonal physical distance of at least one meter.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that consuming a mixture of three home remedies can cure and prevent COVID-19, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
289,HEADLINE: Kenya has not blocked flights from Europe and the US,"An article claiming that Kenya has blocked flights from Europe and the United States of America has a FALSE HEADLINE.The article, published by Kenya Today, says that only countries with mild or low levels of community transmission, or declining incidence of COVID-19 will be allowed to operate flights to Kenya.The claim is attributed to Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia, and explains that passengers travelling from China, Zimbabwe, South Korea and Japan will be allowed entry into Kenya.Other countries from which travelers will be allowed are Canada, Ethiopia, Switzerland, Rwanda, Uganda, Namibia and Morocco.Speaking to PesaCheck on the phone, CS Macharia termed the article as misleading, saying his ministry has not blocked flights or passengers from Europe and the US from entering Kenya.The CS clarified that Kenya had initially listed 11 countries whose passengers will be exempted from mandatory quarantine. The countries correspond to those listed in the Kenya Today article.He said the decision was informed by the fact that these countries are classified as low-risk; citizens from these countries are not required to self isolate upon arrival.“The list includes countries from which travelers will not be required to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival in the country. The list will be reviewed by the Ministry of Health on a day-to-day basis,” CS Macharia said.Kenya’s airspace was closed to passenger flights on March 15, soon after the first COVID-19 case was reported in the country. President Uhuru Kenyatta on July 6 directed the resumption of international flights, beginning August 1.On July 31, the Ministry of Transport updated the list of countries from which travellers will be exempt from quarantine to include the US (except for three states — Texas, Florida, and California), UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Italy.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that Kenya has blocked entry of flights bringing passengers from Europe and the US into the country and finds it to have a FALSE HEADLINE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE

While some home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines or treatments that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease.In an email to PesaCheck, WHO denied the claim that ginger, pepper, and honey have any effect in curing or treating COVID-19.The WHO media relations officer, Greta Isac, said that while the mixture could have soothing effects or even provide reassurance during an illness, it should not be assumed to be effective in treating COVID-19.Ms Isac added that WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 and will continue to provide updated information as soon as viable research results become available.However, while ginger, honey, and pepper might have antibacterial properties, WHO has clarified that their effect on COVID-19 has not been determined.WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the WHO has accepted an Indian student’s home remedy as a cure for COVID-19 and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
291,do diaspora remittances coming into Kenya compare with forex earnings from tourism?,"According to Herman Manyora, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, tourism in Kenya brings in less foreign exchange than diaspora remittances.Professor Manyora made this claim on May 14, 2020, responding to an article by hotelier Mohammed Hersi in the Business Daily about the government’s intention to bail out the tourism sector following fears of revenue decline due to travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic that had crippled the sector, and the resulting economic downturn.Tourism is a vital source of revenue for the government, employing a significant number of Kenyans both directly and indirectly.COVID-19 has hit the sector hard, bringing operators to their knees and causing employers to reduce their staff headcount and cut salaries as well as other overheads.So, the question is, do remittances from the diaspora bring in more foreign exchange compared to the tourism sector?PesaCheck has investigated the claim that diaspora remittances bring more foreign exchange compared to tourism in Kenya and found it to be TRUE based on the following:Data from the World Bank shows that Kenya is the third-largest recipient of diaspora cash inflows in sub-Saharan Africa. Only Nigeria and Ghana receive higher inflows from the diaspora, with earnings equivalent to KSh 2.38 trillion (US$ 23.8 billion) and KSh 350 billion (US$ 3.5 billion) respectively.The Migration and Development Brief published by the World Bank indicates that diaspora remittances to Kenya expanded by 3.7 percent in 2019 to reach KSh 280 billion (USD 2.8 billion). This translates to an increase of KSh 10 billion (USD 1 billion) over the 2018 remittance inflows that amounted to KSh 270 billion (about USD 2.7 billion).The bulk of remittances in the first five months of 2015 come from North America and Europe, thanks to the large populations of Kenyans living in countries such as the US and the United Kingdom.Diaspora remittances by source region, 2020Based on these statistics, it is clear that in recent years, inflows from remittances sent home by Kenyans working and living abroad have always been higher than tourism earnings and continue to register growth, outpacing forex earnings from key areas of the economy including tourism.Tourism, Diaspora remittances and Tea and Coffee export earnings, 2015–2019Despite a narrowing in the difference with earnings from tourism, diaspora cash inflows remain the largest source of foreign exchange inflows for the country. Meanwhile, tourism earnings have surpassed revenues generated from both tea and coffee exports, making it a more significant foreign exchange earner for Kenya.Both diaspora remittance inflows and tourism earnings are likely to decline significantly in 2020 due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Bank projects that remittances to sub-Saharan Africa will decrease by 23.1 percent to bring total inflows to KSh 3.7 trillion (USD 37 billion).Kenya’s tourism sector also faces a grim year, following travel restrictions and the closure of airports to non-essential international travel in over 145 countries as at June 7. While international air travel is set to resume on 1 August, the country’s growing number of COVID-19 cases is likely to dissuade tourists from travelling to the country.Tourism in Kenya relies majorly on the United States, East Africa, several European countries as well as India and China for international visitor arrivals. The Kenya Economic Update from the World Bank for the month of April, 2020 identifies tourism as one of the sectors that will register a significant decline due to COVID-19 shocks.Tourist arrivals by country of origin, 2019A number of countries on the top ten list have been severely affected by COVID-19, including the US, UK, Italy and South Africa. Additionally, the economic impacts of the pandemic mean that residents in these countries who would otherwise have disposable income to spend on vacations may not be able to do so in the near future.Despite this outlook, the sector remains a major source of not only foreign exchange, but also jobs with 1.5 million jobs — both direct and indirect — attributed to the sector. As noted by the Ministry of Tourism in 2018, 73.9 percent of total international visitors to Kenya are holiday-makers. Some other visitors come to the country for business and conferences, underlying the important role tourism plays in Kenya’s economy.While tourism dominates the service sector in Kenya, and is deeply integrated into multiple sectors of Kenya’s economy, diaspora remittances are the clear leader in terms of contribution to the economy, making Professor Manyora’s claim TRUE.",How

It also recommends the familiar practice of social distancing and hygiene habits, and “preventive medication”.Hydroxychloroquine, vitamin C and zinc tablets are listed on the prescription as preventive drugs. Crocin or Calpol should be taken in case of fever, while cetrizine, and cough syrup are recommended for throat pain and cough.Dr Raj Kamal Agarwal confirmed that he did not write the prescription, adding that someone forged his signature to spread rumour and defamed him.However, there are some major pointers on the prescription which suggest it is not authentic.To begin with, the note is addressed ‘to whom it may concern’, which is unlikely, as prescriptions are required to bear the patient’s name and basic information.Further, while a prescription is specific to individuals, this note addresses multiple people, stating, “It is advised that everybody takes this preventive medicine”.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital refuted the claims made on the prescription through its official Twitter and Facebook accounts, and clarified that the letter was fake.On July 4, the World Health Organization (WHO), stopped trials of hydroxychloroquine as treatment for COVID-19 following recommendations made by the steering committee of Solidarity Trials International.Additionally, PesaCheck has previously debunked claims on hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.PesaCheck has looked into a prescription on the letterhead of Sri Ganga Ram Hospital’s Senior Consultant, Dr Raj Kamal Agarwal, that claims the doctor recommends ‘home isolation’ for COVID-19 patients along with medicines like hydroxychloroquine, crocin and cetrizine, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

Rather, it was only targeted on non-beneficiaries of HELB loans seeking compliance certificates. The waiver is also already in effect since July 15, 2020.According to the statement, the HELB compliance certificate enables institutions to assess the creditworthiness, social responsibility and integrity of job seekers before hiring them.Previously, the requirement for a clearance certificate has applied to both beneficiaries of HELB loans and non-beneficiaries alike.But according to HELB CEO Charles Ringera, the institution determined from various stakeholder engagements and citizen feedback that the charges for non-loanee compliance certificates were perceived to be punitive especially by many unemployed youths.Mr Ringera said that the waiver would serve to “motivate Kenyan youth to seek their HELB compliance certificates as they seek jobs or opportunities to contribute towards building the nation.”PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Higher Education Loans Board (HELB) has promised to refund all the money it has collected for compliance certificates, and finds it to be SATIRE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",SATIRE:

Speaking to AFP, Mr Anderson confirmed that while people may die of pneumonia developed as a result of coronavirus disease progression, these deaths are only counted once, as COVID-19, and not multiple times.Both illnesses — pneumonia and COVID-19 — would be noted on their death certificate, Mr Anderson further stated.This claim has been debunked by AFP Fact-Check and USA Today.The CDC tracks deaths from all three diseases in the provisional totals because their symptoms often overlap. Additionally, pneumonia or flu may develop in a person suffering from COVID-19.While multiple illnesses can contribute to a single death, the World Health Organization has regulations for how member countries classify and code the underlying cause of death. Guided by these regulations, the CDC has listed COVID-19 as the underlying cause on death certificates in 94 percent of deaths.The CDC previously displayed “deaths with pneumonia and COVID-19” next to the count of all provisional coronavirus disease-related deaths since April 4.

299,7 Kenyan women die from complications due to unsafe abortion every day?,"Pregnancy and childbirth are risky life stages for many Kenyan women, and the subject of maternal death is stubbornly associated with these periods. The risk is made worse by issues such as poor health infrastructure, ill-equipped medical centres, and retrogressive cultural practices that discourage women and communities from adopting best practices that can save lives. Many deaths can be prevented by adequate prenatal care, qualified health workers during delivery, and proper postnatal care.One critical target for countries that are trying to meet sustainable development goals is to reduce the number of mothers dying from complications during or immediately after pregnancy. The global target for 2030 is to have fewer than 70 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in each country.While there are many causes of maternal deaths, Lisa MaryAnne, a psychosocial counsellor, claimed on Twitter that unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal deaths among adolescents girls and women in Kenya.VERITAS WOMEN, an interactive helpdesk to discuss and disseminate information on women’s rights and gender equity, tweeted that as many as seven women die every day in Kenya due to unsafe abortions.So, is unsafe abortion a major cause of maternal deaths, and do seven women die each day from unsafe abortion in Kenya?PesaCheck looked into the claim that abortion is a major cause of maternal death and found it to be TRUE, based on the following reasons:According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 19 million unsafe abortions are performed annually, with more than five million of these cases resulting in complications that require hospitalization. In Africa, four million unsafe abortions occur yearly and 40 percent of these cases result in death from abortion-related complications.Although Article 26 (IV) of the Kenyan constitution provides for safe abortion under special circumstances such as when the life or health of a woman is in danger, a nationally representative study of health facilities in Kenya estimated that 465,000 unsafe abortions occurred in 2012, out of which a large proportion resulted in complications or deaths.In Kenya, maternal mortality is accountable for about 6,000 deaths per year and unsafe abortion is responsible for 30 to 40 percent of the maternal deaths, which is much higher than the estimated rate of 10 percent for the African continent and the world average of 13 percent.The rate of women dying from abortion complications in Kenya is high at 266 deaths per 100,000 unsafe abortions. By comparison, WHO estimates that fatalities among women in developed regions of the world due to complications from unsafe abortion are around 30 deaths per 100,000 unsafe abortions. The rate for Eastern Africa is 530 deaths per 100,000 unsafe abortions.The 2014 Kenya Demographic Health Survey found that unsafe abortion accounted for 35 percent of maternal deaths. Over 40 percent of pregnancies in Kenya are unintended, that is either mistimed or unwanted. The high number of unplanned pregnancies stems largely from an unmet need for contraceptives.The WHO data shows Kenya’s maternal mortality remains high at 488 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. While this is below the sub-Saharan average of 640 deaths per 100,000, progress towards improved maternal health has been very slow and most maternal deaths are directly caused by or are related to unsafe abortion, pregnancy and childbirth. This includes obstetric complications such as severe bleeding, infection, hypertensive disorders, and obstructed labour.A 2012 survey conducted by Kenya’s Ministry of Health in partnership with the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC ) and International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) found that there were 464,000 abortions induced that year,which translates to an abortion rate of 48 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 49; and an abortion ratio of 30 per 100 live births. About half (49 percent) of all pregnancies in Kenya were unintended and 41 percent of unintended pregnancies ended in an abortion.Six years later, another report published by the Ministry of Health and the APHRC showed that an estimated 464,690 abortions take place annually — approximately 1,300 a day — and these are only the cases reported from the public healthcare system.According to the APHRC, approximately 14 percent of pregnancies in Kenya end in abortion. Most of these abortions are performed by unskilled people, often in conditions that do not meet minimal medical standards. Both the people performing these abortions and the patients may not follow the appropriate post-abortion care measures, further increasing the risk of complications. As a result, about 2,600 women and girls die from unsafe abortions annually in Kenya, which translates to seven deaths a day.Data from Marie Stopes International corroborates the estimate that 2,600 Kenyan women die from unsafe abortion annually, adding that nearly 120,000 women are hospitalized each year due to abortion-related complications.Dr. Patrick Omondi of Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital’s Department of Obstetrics Gynaecology told PesaCheck that abortion is among the five leading causes of maternal death in Kenya, with the other leading causes being haemorrhage, hypertension (pre-eclampsia and eclampsia), infections, complications from delivery.Based on this evidence, it is true that seven women die daily due to unsafe abortion in Kenya, making unsafe termination of pregnancy one of the leading causes of maternal death in the country.",Do

Mr. Rono further said that in 2018, there were 780 new cases of HIV infections and as of September 2019, there were 1,000 new cases reported and that number was expected to climb further to 1,200 by the end of 2019.So the question is, did Uasin Gishu record 1000 new cases of HIV in 2019?PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Uasin Gishu County recorded 1000 new HIV cases in 2019 and finds it to be MOSTLY TRUE based on the following reasons:HIV is a sexually transmitted infection, which leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition if left unmanaged. HIV targets the immune system and weakens people’s defence systems against infections.According to the Kenya HIV County Profile 2016, HIV prevalence in Uasin Gishu County was 4.7% — lower than the national prevalence of 5.9%. The county contributed to 1.8% of the total number of people living with HIV in Kenya, and ranked 18th nationally. There were 520 new HIV cases in adults and 107 in children under 14 years reported in 2015.In 2015, Uasin Gishu County contributed 1.6% and 0.7% of the total new HIV infections in Kenya among children and adults respectively. Adolescents aged 10–19 years contributed 25%, while young people aged 15–24 years made up 47% of all new HIV infections in the county, according to Kenya’s Ministry of Health.The Ministry of Health data shows that, nationally, approximately 29% of all new HIV infections are among adolescents and young people especially young women, who still bear the impact of the HIV epidemic due to limited access to information, services, stigma and discrimination.The 2015 Kenya’s Fast track Plan shows that young women aged 15 to 24 years post the highest number of HIV infections and in 2013, they contributed 21 percent of new adult HIV infections in Kenya.The Kenya Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (KENPHIA) 2018 survey indicates that Kenya’s HIV prevalence rose to 4.9%, with prevalence of HIV among women at 6.6%, twice that of men (3.1%).The top five HIV high-prevalence counties in 2018 ranked by percentage were Homa Bay (19.6), Kisumu (17.5), Siaya (15.3), Migori (13) and Busia (9).; while prevalence was lowest in nine counties of Garissa (<01), Mandera (0.2), Tana River (1.1), Kiambu (1.1), Marsabit (1.20, West-Pokot (1.3), Baringo (1.8), and Samburu (1.9). Uasin Gishu County had a prevalence of 5.5 percent.According to the HIV Estimates Report Kenya, Uasin Gishu had 772 new cases of HIV, and a total of 32,260 people living with HIV in 2018. This fact shows that the HIV/AIDs coordinator statistics for 2018 (780) are close to the actual figures from the 2018 report.Regional HIV coordinator, Ms Faith Kosgei, confirmed that by the time Mr. Rono was making the statement, they had not received the actual data for new cases estimates for 2019.According to the latest HIV estimates received by PesaCheck from NACC, Uasin Gishu county had 895 new cases from adults and 253 from children, reaching a total of 1,148 new cases in 2019.The data shows that individuals aged 15 to 24 make up a third of the new HIV infections at 390 cases in total.The sources above show that the projected value of new cases that were stated by Mr. Rono in September 2019 is not far off from the estimates given by the NACC, making the claim by the Uasin Gishu county HIV coordinator during the World AIDS Day 2019 to be MOSTLY TRUE.",Did

The Japanese neurologist who allegedly designed it is not identified in the post.The optical illusion is designed to appear to move with the movement of the eyes, and indeed appears to rotate on its own.The image was created by Yurii Perepadia, a Ukrainian graphic designer and vector illustrator, and not a Japanese neurologist as claimed. The image also does not indicate stress levels.Perepaedia shared this image on Instagram in 2018, explaining that he used the effects of Akiyoshi Kitaoka, a professor of psychology at Ritsumeikan University in Osaka, Japan. Prof Kitaoka’s main research subjects are visual illusions and he also designs illusions, many of which he has posted online.The optical illusion was drawn using Adobe Illustrator — a vector graphics editing software — on September 26, 2016, and consists of white and black strokes on differently coloured backgrounds, which shifts the focus of vision and makes it appear as if the image is moving slightly.In the Instagram post, Perepaedia states that the work is his, and does not belong to Yamamoto Hashima, who could be the Japanese psychologist in question.

305,FALSE: This post announcing new guidelines for student loans is misleading,"A Facebook post announcing new guidelines for those applying for student loans at the Higher Education Loans Board (HELB) is PARTLY FALSE.According to the post, HELB has moved its services to a new platform, and all continuing students would be required to update their profiles or risk losing their access to all services offered via the portal.However, the post gives contradictory information as to when the supposed changes were to take effect. At the top of the post, the claim is made that the changes were to take effect “from today’ suggesting that they begin on the same date as the announcement, July 17. Subsequently, the same post says changes will be effected on July 18.Various versions of the HELB post have circulated online. Some claim the deadline for submitting loan applications for both new and continuing university students is August 9, 2020, while others claim that the deadline for subsequent applications is August 31, 2020.Additionally, the post asks applicants to pay a consultation fee for processing registration into the new portal. Those processing fresh registration are required to pay KSh 200 while those updating their details are charged KSh 100.In an email response to PesaCheck, Wavi Mungala, the head of corporate communication and customer experience at HELB, confirmed that the institution has indeed upgraded its Student, Employer and Institution portals.HELB made an announcement in this regard on its Facebook page on July 21 with a link to the new portal, which requires all students to key in their particulars afresh upon which the portal will validate them.“We also fully transitioned the HELB 2020–2021 Undergraduate Second & Subsequent Loan Application Form for continuing students to the HELB Mobile App as well as USSD *642#. These applications are no longer being received as physical hardcopies,” Ms Mungala said.This was meant to minimize paper contact as a measure to contain the spread of COVID-19, she added.However, Ms Mungala clarified that the August 31 deadline only applies to second and subsequent applications; the application process for first-time undergraduate students closes on December 31, 2020.She added that there is no reason for students to incur extra costs for processing the applications or accessing HELB services beyond the normal browsing fees at a cybercafe as HELB does not charge for this service.Additionally, HELB tweeted a warning on July 17, 2020, disowning the information carried in the post, adding that all HELB communication is done through its official contacts, which were also shared in the tweet.“As we head into the weekend, we wish to remind you to stay safe, sanitize and be on the lookout for fraudsters and fraud alerts,” read the tweet.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post announcing new guidelines for student loan applications at the Higher Education Loans Board (HELB), and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",PARTLY
306,This post containing advice on how to kill the COVID-19 with heat is false,"A Facebook post with an image claiming that a combination of inhaling very hot steam from a kettle, hot gargles, and drinking hot tea four times a day can cure COVID-19 is FALSE.The image is an undated screenshot attributed to an unidentified person living in Wuhan, stating that the steps contained were taken by residents in the city to protect against COVID-19. Wuhan is where the first case of COVID-19 was reported, and the text in the image further claims that every household in the city has a COVID-19 patient, adding that residents are no longer going to the hospital to seek treatment and are instead treating themselves.It is unlikely that every household in Wuhan has had a COVID-19 patient, given that the total national tally of confirmed cases in China stood at 87,028 on July 27, 2020. Over 11 million people reside in the metropolitan area of Wuhan, which is the capital of Hubei Province in central China, and the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is a small fraction of this by comparison.The screenshot says that adopting the treatment routine as suggested will kill the coronavirus in four days, and on the fifth day, one should get a negative test result.However, while it is true that heat at 56°C can kill the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 min (quick reduction), according to data on the resistance of the SARS Coronavirus against environmental factors and disinfectants published on the WHO website, there is still no way to increase your body temperature beyond the normal 36.5°C to 37°C in order to kill the COVID-19 virus.Additionally, ingesting hot beverages can actually elevate the risk of developing oesophageal cancer, according to a 2016 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the WHO.The WHO’s Technical Report Series 916 on Diet, Nutrition andthe Prevention of Chronic Diseases warns against consuming drinks when they are at scalding hot temperature, as one of the recommendations to reduce the risk of developing cancer.Further, the WHO maintains that there are currently no approved cures for COVID-19 and the organisation’s page advising the public on COVID-19 does not list inhaling steam, drinking hot tea or hot gargles as treatment for the virus.WHO has previously debunked a number of claims that associate conditions of heat to the diminished survival of coronavirus, such as the claim that taking a hot bath is a preventive measure against the disease.Several versions of the text have been circulating on Facebook from as early as April 2020, some with added text appealing to users to spread the message widely.

One unit contains 10 milliliters of pure alcohol.The American Cancer Society says alcohol doesn’t have any benefits in terms of cancer prevention — in fact, drinking any amount increases one’s risk of getting the disease.Ethanol is the common form of alcohol found in most alcoholic beverages, whether beer, wine, distilled spirit or other drinks. Evidence suggests ethanol is directly linked to an increased risk of cancer, not other ingredients in the drink.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that alcoholic drinks provide immunity against cancer infection and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

312,Kenya’s exports to the US under AGOA worth $700 million in 2019?,"During a parliamentary vetting exercise on February 20, Ms Betty Maina, the nominee for cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Industrialization claimed that Kenya exported goods worth $700 million to the United States in 2019, under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).Ms Maina made the claim when she appeared before the National Assembly Committee on Appointments following her nomination to the post in a cabinet reshuffle in January. She said $470 million was from the sale of apparel.Ms Maina, who previously served as the principal secretary for Trade and Industrialisation, was sworn in on February 28 shortly after making these remarks following approval by the National Assembly.So the question is, did Kenya sell goods worth $700 million to the USA under AGOA in 2019?PesaCheck has looked into the claim and found it to be FALSE based on the following reasons;The African Growth and Opportunity Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, in May 2000, with the aim of boosting trade and investment between the United States and 39 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.AGOA offers partner countries an opportunity to export their products to the US market duty-free. Under the arrangement, Kenya is ranked among the top five exporters of apparel, behind Nigeria, South Africa and Angola.As a member of key regional organizations, Kenya is also a major beneficiary of Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFA), signed by the US with both the East African Community (EAC), and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). However, data from the AGOA website shows that Kenya’s total exports to the US were valued at $517.6 million, which is below the $700 million claimed by Ms Maina.AGOA and the Generalized System of PreferencesIt is important to note that these 2019 export totals include exports under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). GSP is a pre-AGOA initiative that gives preferential tariffs to imports entering the US from developing countries, allowing them to grow their economies through trade with the US. The combined export earnings under AGOA and GSP are less than $700 million, which brings Ms Maina’s claim into question.There has been a reasonable increase in earnings from goods sold under AGOA to the US going by data from 2018 and 2019. In 2018, Kenya exported goods that netted USD 470.3 million, which was USD 47.3 million less than in 2019 under both AGOA and GSP. Nevertheless, according to a brochure showing trade between the US and Kenya, under AGOA, Kenya generated USD 466 million in 2018.Data shows that under AGOA Kenya’s earnings were as follows from 2014–2019.From the data, it can be seen that the upward trend depicts the growing trade between Kenya and the US. However, a slump in 2016 can be attributed to the presidential election in the US as well as the heated political campaigns in Kenya preceding the 2017 general election.As the value of the country’s exports under AGOA continues to rise, earnings from apparel are increasing proportionately. Among beneficiaries of AGOA, Kenya ranks as one of the leading exporters of apparel with earnings of $350.45 million on record as of September 2019.However, in 2018 Kenya sold apparel products that brought in $393 million under AGOA.The $517.8 million that Kenya earned under both AGOA and GSP falls significantly below $700 million claimed. Removing the contribution of exports under GSP would result in an even smaller revenue contribution from export earnings under AGOA.This, therefore, renders the claim by Ms Betty Maina that Kenya exported goods worth $700 million under AGOA to the US in 2019 FALSE.",Were

The domain is listed as belonging to Domain Protection Services, Inc. in Denver, US, which indicates that the hosting information is hidden.CyberSpace Kenya, an organisation involved in digital security and online safety in Kenya, told PesaCheck that the domain name shares an IP address with a number of other scam sites. The organisation has in the past flagged a number of other scam sites, including ramaphosafoundation.xyz, freemobiledata.xyz, proceed01.xyz, and uhurukenyattafoundation.xyz.“We have been able to ascertain that that site is indeed a scam site. It is not any different from our previous exposes. The only thing they did was change their domain name,” a representative from CyberSpace Kenya said.The site targets bank account details for phishing purposes, the organisation stated.Phishing is the fraudulent use of electronic communication to trick people into parting with sensitive and confidential information such as usernames, passwords, credit card information, and more for malicious purposes. These credentials are then used to gain unauthorized access to one’s email, bank, or other accounts.Scammers appear to be capitalizing on the COVID-19 cash flow crisis, especially among middle and low-income earners, by promising monetary incentives, but they are scouting for personal information for malicious purposes.To avoid phishing attacks on social media, one should refrain from clicking links from unfamiliar or questionable websites and accounts.

315,Amina Mohamed has not been selected as the Director-General of the WTO,"An article published in CityNews claiming that Kenya’s Amina Mohamed has been selected as the director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is FALSE.The article states that Ambassador Mohamed beat Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to the appointment, but does not give any further information on the win, instead stating that further details on the developing story would be published later.However, the selection process for the position is still ongoing, and no candidate has been declared winner. The WTO has an elaborate procedure that begins nine months prior to the expiry of the incumbent’s tenure.Nonetheless, current Director-General Roberto Azevêdo announced that he would step down on August 31, cutting short his second term by one year. The DG made the announcement in May 2020, paving way for the process to appoint his successor, with eight candidates nominated to battle it out for the position.The process is currently in its second stage, which began in mid-July following the introduction of the candidates to the WTO member states, and is set to end on September 7. Ambassador Mohamed, who currently serves as Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Heritage, and Culture, is among the eight nominees.During this second stage, the eight pitched their candidature during the WTO General Council, which was followed by an opportunity for familiarisation and campaigning that will continue until the end of the selection phase.The third and final stage will see each of the nominees assessed through a consultative process among WTO members with the aim of arriving at one candidate for the appointment through consensus. This phase takes place for a period of up to two months, and is led by the chair of the General Council, currently held by David Walker of New Zealand.In the event the consultative process fails to reach a decision on who should be appointed by the deadline of the third phase, then members will vote for their preferred candidate.Apart from Ambassador Mohamed and Ms Okonjo-Iweala, other candidates include Dr Jesús Seade Kuri of Mexico, Egyptian Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh, Tudor Ulianovschi (Moldova), Yoo Myung-hee (South Korea), Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijri (Saudi Arabia) and Dr Liam Fox (United Kingdom).The new DG is expected to serve a four-year term, and will be eligible to seek reappointment for a second and final term, in accordance with the guidelines for such appointments.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Kenya’s CS for Sports, Heritage, and Culture, Ambassador Amina Mohamed has won the position of director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

317,Does the elderberry plant kill viruses and boost the immune system?,"Elderberry — the dark blue or purple fruit of the elder shrub also known as Sambucus nigra is grown in Tanzania and is naturalised in parts of Kenya and Uganda. It has been touted as a versatile herbal remedy that can boost immunity, fight off colds and flu, and relieve respiratory conditions. It is known in folk medicine for its antiviral properties. The flowers and berries of the elderberry plant are often used in supplements dispensed in a gummy or syrup form, or infused into teas.The battle against COVID-19 has led to renewed interest in the medicinal value of foods and alternative medicinal remedies, including elderberry, with claims that it can increase immunity against the disease. A recent article shared on Opera News website claimed that the plant “kills all viruses” and strengthens the immune system. The article outlined a juice recipe with elderberry as its main ingredient.PesaCheck has looked into the claims made in the article about the elderberry plant to better understand why it is seen as an effective antiviral.So how are elderberries thought to work as an antiviral?Among the immunity-boosting properties of the elderberry is its potent antiviral activity. In fact, elderberry has been used for hundreds of years to fight off viral infections like influenza and has been found to inhibit the replication of 11 different strains of the flu.A systematic review from 2010 published in Phytotherapy Research, a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal on medicinal plant research, appraised literature from available scientific studies and concluded that elderberries contain compounds which may have antioxidant and antiviral effects.In one of the few human studies published in the United States National Library of Medicine, 60 people with flu-like symptoms took 15 millilitres of elderberry syrup four times a day. Their symptoms improved four days faster than those who took a placebo.In another study published by the American Botanical Council, 32 people, also with flu-like symptoms, took lozenges containing 175 milligrams (mg) of elderberry extract four times a day for two days. After 24 hours, they reported an improvement in their symptoms, such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and nasal congestion.A double-blind (study where neither the participants nor the experimenters know who is receiving a particular treatment) and randomized trial looked at whether elderberry extract could prevent people from experiencing cold-like symptoms after traveling on an airplane. People took lozenges containing 300 mg of elderberry extract and 150 mg of rice flour twice a day for 10 days before traveling. Researchers found that the capsules did not prevent the symptoms, but those who took elderberry had less severe symptoms that lasted for a shorter time.In a paper published in the Journal of Functional Foods, investigators reported that substances present in elderberries can stop an influenza virus from entering and replicating in human cells. One of the reasons for this might be because elderberries contain hemagglutinin, an antigenic glycoprotein found on the surface of the influenza viruses that binds the virus to the cell that is being infected. Hemagglutinin from elderberries likely prevents the virus from causing infection if taken before exposure.The results of these studies indicate that elderberries offer significant health benefits in treating symptoms of cold and influenza. They also found an indication of some antiviral activity. Researchers, however, say more studies and evidence are needed to find out whether taking elderberry has any medically proven benefits. It is also important to note that these studies were conducted under laboratory conditions and the therapeutic value has yet to be established in human subjects.The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) also corroborates that more research is needed to confirm the truth of these possible health benefits.While opinions vary on whether elderberry is helpful, Dr Lawrence Munyali, an outpatient doctor at Nairobi West Hospital, says it’s safe in small doses. He cautions that it is important to consult a healthcare professional as unripe or uncooked berries or flowers from the plant can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Larger amounts can cause even more serious poisoning.It is true that elderberries exhibit multiple modes of therapeutic action against influenza infection but there is no evidence to conclude that it can kill all viruses and boost the immune system. With few studies done in humans, researchers don’t know yet how effective the plant may be.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",Fact-check:
318,This company offering unsecured loans online is not legitimate,"A company named Quick loans Kenya using a Google form to offer unsecured loans in 15 to 20 minutes is FAKE.The company which poses as a digital lending platform, also claims to be a fully registered lending company in Kenya.To benefit from a loan, one is required to fill out a Google form detailing the individual’s personal information as well as the purpose of the loan.The next step indicates the loanee qualifies for a loan limit of KSh 12,000 regardless of the amount put in on the previous section. Applicants are asked to pay an application fee of KSh 250 to an MPesa Paybill number before receiving the amount.However, the Paybill number 4019625 to which applicants are asked to send the registration fee is registered to Linspot Ventures and not to Quick loans Kenya.The Digital Lenders Association of Kenya (DLAK) told PesaCheck that neither Quick loans Kenya nor Linspot Ventures are registered as digital lenders. The Association has previously warned mobile loan borrowers to be wary of fake lending apps that have flooded the market.DLAK’s director and treasurer, Kelvin Mutiso, cautioned that genuine lenders do not ask customers to pay a registration fee or CRB fee beforehand, and ask for much details to determine creditworthiness.Mr Mutiso’s assertion appears to agree with the general procedure of applying for unsecured loans from most financial institutions in Kenya, such as the NIC Bank, which require the loanee to provide personal information including proof of employment or source of their income and bank statements, but no guarantee is needed to secure the loan.In the case of mobile loans, the applicant needs to sign up with mobile digital apps like M-PESA Fanikiwa or mobile banking services like Mobi Loan, where the providers will determine the creditworthiness of the customer.None of these loan processes require the loanee to pay upfront for the loan to be processed. However, the customer has to abide by the terms and conditions which include repayment of the loan within the agreed period.Most of the digital lending are not regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya CBK. In April this year, CBK barred unregulated digital lenders from using Credit Reference Bureaus (CRBs) — which assess the creditworthiness of a potential customer.Additionally, a complainant who reported Quick loans Kenya to Safaricom — the mobile company offering Paybill and M-Pesa services — was advised to report the matter to the police for investigation to commence.A business search of the company name via the eCitizen portal shows that the company does not exist.PesaCheck has looked into the authenticity of an online application for unsecured loans from a company called Quick loans Kenya, and finds it to be HOAX.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:

The Police spokesperson, Charles Owino, clarified to PesaCheck via phone that the Kenya Gazette notice was meant to formalize the upgrading of the existing police post adjacent to the arena to a full police station, and not repurposing the entire stadium as claimed by the article in question.Mr Owino explained that elevation to a full police station involves changes in how the post would be administered, with the Officer Commanding Police Post (OCPP) being replaced with an Officer Commanding Police station (OCS) instead.Police stations have a larger jurisdiction than police posts, and the upgrade will see an increase in the number of police officers and vehicles deployed to the station. While a police post has about 10 police officers, a police station hosts up to 50 police officers.Nyayo Stadium is a 15,000 seater multi-purpose sporting arena in Kenya’s capital Nairobi.

324,This video of a fish market on a beach is not from Shela in Lamu county,"A video posted on Twitter claiming to show tuna fish on a beach in Shela, Lamu County has been taken out of context and is FALSE.The text accompanying the video says resources are abundant in the area and reads in part, ‘Shela, Lamu County Tuna Fish in plenty’.Lamu is on the most northerly section of Kenya’s Indian Ocean coast. It borders Tana River and Garissa counties and shares the Indian Ocean coastline with four other counties to the south — Kilifi, Kwale, Mombasa and Tana River. The Ocean provides a wealth of marine life that supports fishing and tourism activities. Shela town is located in the western part of the county and features Shela beach, one of the most popular beaches in the county.However, Shela’s beach has white sand, with tufted dunes in the background, unlike the one shared in the video on the Twitter post. The inhabitants of Shela are traditionally wood craftsmen and fishermen. Shela’s marine biodiversity includes a variety of coral reefs, sea-grass beds, sand bars, and creeks that are not visible in the video shared.A reverse image search shows that the video in the post is from June 2019. It was shared alongside an article by globo.com showing an incident where fishermen in Galinhos, on the North Coast of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, had caught tons of fish.The fishermen are overheard speaking in Portuguese which is Brazil’s official language. Kenya’s official languages are English and Swahili, and most Lamu residents are traditionally Swahili speakers. The original footage shows fisherfolk harvesting and gutting permit, a type of game fish found in the western Atlantic Ocean.The fishermen are also seen in the video selling their catch in what appears to be an open-air market on the beach, an unlikely sight in Lamu, which has a municipal market managed by the county government.Common fish species found in Lamu include sailfish, kingfish, snappers, and tuna. Tunas are elongated, streamlined, rounded body, slender tail, and generally dark and silver. These species are different compared to the ones in video.All fishing is regulated in Kenya under the Fisheries Management and Development Act №35 of 2016. The Act sets standards for fishing, quality and safety of processing, data recording and collection and conservation and management of the marine resource.The act also allows local fisherfolk to participate in the management of fishing and fisheries through beach management units established by the county governments. These community-based fishing organisations are governed by regulations and ensure national standards are observed.Only those engaged in fishing for sport are allowed to land fish outside of designated fish landing stations or ports including beach management units.PesaCheck has looked into a video shared on Twitter showing fishermen harvesting and cleaning fish on a beach that is labelled as Shela, Lamu County in Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

327,COVID-19 nasal swab test does not damage the blood-brain barrier,"A tweet claiming that COVID-19 swab tests damage the blood-brain barrier is FALSE.The tweet contains an image of text that claims the spot in the nose that is swabbed to collect a sample for testing is the ‘Blood-Brain Barrier’.The tweet describes the Blood-Brain Barrier as a ‘layer of cells that keeps toxins from getting into the brain’, stating that if this layer is compromised, it could lead to inflammation in the brain, with toxins and bacteria passing through and infecting brain tissue, which could lead to death.The image in the tweet also states that breaching the blood-brain barrier is linked to autism, strokes, ADHD, heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, mood disorders, and liver damage.However, the blood-brain barrier is not one physical site, but is a tightly packed layer of cells that line all the blood vessels within the brain and spinal cord. TheAccording to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) is a selectively permeable membrane that regulates the passage of molecules from the bloodstream into the microenvironment of the neurons within the brain.The barrier achieves this with the aid of multiple cellular transport channels scattered along the membrane, and it prevents pathogens and toxins in the bloodstream from reaching the brain, while allowing vital nutrients through.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are five acceptable methods to collect respiratory samples that can be tested for COVID-19. Of these, two dominant techniques are currently in use.The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or nasal swab test is used to detect the presence of the virus in nasal secretions or saliva. It is the most commonly used technique, and is referred to in the post. PCR tests are currently considered to be more clinically sensitive for detecting early infection. The second common method tests blood samples to see if the body has produced antibodies to fight the virus, known as antibody testing.Nasal swabbing is not unique to COVID-19 testing. Nasal swabs, or nasopharyngeal cultures are routinely used to diagnose respiratory infections, whether caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. They are considered generally safe, as the virus is best detected in specimens containing infected cells and secretions.When conducting a swab test, the examiner inserts a long stick with a soft brush on the end, up the nose, and twirls it around for a few seconds. The soft bristles will collect a sample of secretions for analysis. To get a good sample, the swab has to reach as far back into the cavity that extends from the base of the nose to the back of the throat, and collect cells and fluids from the whole passageway.Since samples are taken from the upper respiratory tract where the nasal cavity is, it is anatomically impossible to touch the brain with a swab without drilling through the cribriform plate, a bone that separates the nasal area from the base of the skull.However, nasal testing can cause discomfort as it activates the lacrimal reflex, causing tears to flow, and may also trigger gagging when the back of the throat is touched.Dr Nyawira Macharia, a resident doctor at Thika Level 5 Hospital, reiterates that COVID-19 nasal swab tests do not damage the Blood-Brain Barrier, adding that in order to get anywhere near the BBB, the swab would have to go through layers of muscle and tissue, as well as the base of the skull.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that COVID-19 swab tests damage the Blood-Brain Barrier and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

330,This post warning against face mask use greatly exaggerates the potential risks to users,"A Facebook post claiming that face masks are not protective and actually threaten your health is MISLEADING.The post lists a number of supposed health risks of wearing a mask, including decreased oxygen intake and increasing toxin inhalation, which eventually cause the immune system to shut down.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing a cloth face-covering, especially when going out in public and in situations where it is difficult to maintain the recommended social distance.Cloth coverings range from homemade cloth and sponge masks to surgical masks with built-in respirators that protect the wearer from airborne particles and liquids.The World Health Organization (WHO) also agrees with this view, noting that the use of masks — in combination with other practices — is key to limiting the spread of COVID-19.An advisory dated June 5 says wearing a mask can prevent the spread of infectious droplets from infected persons who show no symptoms to other people, especially in communities, health care settings and where home care is practised.Additionally, masks also prevent infection-carrying droplets from contaminating the environment around the infected person by filtering respiratory droplets.The post claims that masks ‘activate dormant retroviruses’ and lower the immune system, leading to infection, but there is no evidence of this. This claim is similar to one shared on the conspiracy theory video, Plandemic, which has been widely debunked.The claim that mask use activates viruses within the body implies that wearing one somehow creates the ideal conditions for these viruses to become active again, but this is extremely difficult if proper mask hygiene is maintained, where masks are changed when they become moist, or dirty.The Facebook post claims that there have not been any scientific studies into the effectiveness of mask use, but a number of studies, including one published in the Risk Analysis Journal in September 2018 and another published in The Lancet in June 2020 that both found that wearing masks significantly reduced the risk of infection, especially while also observing other preventive measures recommended by medical experts.Concerning the claim that mask-wearing increases toxin inhalation, health officials say that masks cannot lead to suffocation and death if they are worn properly and are the correct size and shape.The Cleveland Clinic asserts that a person is unlikely to inhale a large amount of carbon dioxide from donning a cloth face mask, especially if it’s only worn for short periods of time. Wearing a mask also makes it harder to touch your nose and mouth, which is another way that the virus gets into the body.PesaCheck has previously debunked claims associated with mask-wearing, and also explained how effective and important wearing a mask is in the context of COVID-19.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that face masks is harmful to the health of the people that wear them, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

332,This Facebook page offering loans to women and youth is not legitimate,"A Facebook page named ‘KWFT Loans Kenya Limited’ offering loans to applicants and asking them to pay a registration fee beforehand is a HOAX.The link shared on the post directs to nairobivoice.com, and offers loans to prospective clients, asking them to fill a form with personal information, such as names, phone numbers and ID numbers. While the name of the company offering the loans does not appear on the site, its name shows up as ‘Women and Youth Funding’ on the Terms and Conditions page of the website.There are several indicators that the site and the loans it offers are fake. The site’s banner text reads ‘Quick access Fast and online: Apply Now’, and does not contain any recognizable branding.The website lists the physical address of the lending company as the second floor of the West End building in Nairobi’s Westlands area. This is the address of the Commission on Administrative Justice.The ‘Our Vision’ text on the site appears to be copied from that of microfinance company Musoni.The criteria to qualify for a form listed on the site includes the use of mobile money services such as MPesa and Airtel Money for more than 3 months, and that the minimum and maximum amounts anyone can borrow are KSh 2,000 and KSh 300,000 respectively.One requirement that has appeared in other scam loan sites is for first-time applicants to pay a fee of KSh 390 that would be refunded if the application was unsuccessful. The fee is not sent to a Paybill number, but to a personal number.A look at the WHOIS information of the website shows that the site was registered on January 16, 2020, while the WHOIS information for KWFT bank the official site of the Kenya Women Microfinance Bank website, shows that the domain was registered in 2014.The Facebook page offering these loans is called ‘KWFT Loans Kenya Limited’, which does not exist. KWFT is the Kenya Women Microfinance Bank, formerly known as Kenya Women Finance Trust, which was founded in 1981 to address the financial needs of women.The bank offers different loan facilities to its clients. A client is required to make a loan application form at a physical branch of the bank.Rafael Kimani, a customer service manager at KWFT, told PesaCheck that the bank does not ask loan applicants to fill forms online. Rather, they offer loans to clients who have accounts with them, and whose accounts meet the requirements for the applied loans. He also confirmed that customers are not required to pay before getting loans from their bank.PesaCheck has previously looked into a similar scam that also offered loans from KWFT through an online application form and asked applicants to pay a fee beforehand.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that KWFT loans Kenya Limited is giving its clients loans that are processed within 30 minutes of application and finds it to be a HOAX.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:
333,Russia has not started production of a COVID-19 vaccine,"An article claiming that Russia has started production of a COVID-19 vaccine is MISLEADING.According to the post, shared on Opera News website, medical researchers at a Russian university have completed human trials of the essential COVID-19 vaccine.The primary source of this claim seems to be a report from the Russian news agency Tass.com. The report says that the research shows the vaccine is effective and safe to use in humans, but it fails to indicate that this was just the initial of two stages in the first phase of a clinical trial.The news was also reported by Russian state-controlled news agency Sputnik News, and tweeted by the Russian embassy in India.However, the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University), the oldest medical school in Russia, posted a news report dated July 10, on its website, clearly stating that this was the first phase of the study and further human testing will be required. Sechenov University was one of the sites where human trials of the vaccine — developed by Russia’s Gamalei Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology — were conducted.The United States National Library of Medicine provides a database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies currently being conducted around the world on its website. “Gam-COVID-Vac Lyo”, developed by Gamalei institute, is among the vaccine candidates listed in Phase-I human trial.The World Health Organization (WHO) document on COVID-19 vaccine candidates also lists the vaccine being developed by Gamalei institute in Phase-I, which means the vaccine needs to go through further human trials before it is considered safe enough for approval for large-scale production.WHO lists only two potential vaccines as having reached the advanced stage of human trials; one developed by Chinese firm Sinovac, and Viral Vector Vaccine from the Oxford University-AstraZeneca.According to The New York Times vaccine tracker, three new vaccines are in the third phase of clinical trials. These are the jointly developed AstraZeneca-University of Oxford from England, and Sinopharm and Sinovac from China. There is also a fourth vaccine in the final phase of trial, but this is an old vaccine for tuberculosis being tested to see if it can also protect against coronavirus.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that Russia has started production of a COVID-19 vaccine that is safe for human use, and finds it is MISLEADING.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

It suggests there was a scramble by Nairobi residents to leave the city and travel upcountry.The bus in the photo belongs to ‘Nyamira Express’, a company that operates between western Kenya and Nairobi.The photo is accompanied by a caption that reads in part, “That’s how the situation is here at the country bus”, implying that the photo shows a mass exodus by Nairobi residents to their rural homes.However, a reverse image search shows that the photo was taken on July 30, 2017, and is credited to Nation Media Group photographer Dennis Onsongo. According to the caption, the photo shows travellers boarding buses at Machakos Country Bus terminus in Nairobi, heading upcountry.The article, posted alongside the photo, said the exodus of residents from Nairobi city ahead of the August 8, 2017 general election was prompted by heightened fears that poll-related violence would break out.PesaCheck has looked into the photo claiming to show travellers leaving Nairobi after the lifting of cessation of movement order, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
336,This infographic listing the health benefits of drinking water at specific times of the day is misleading,"An infographic shared on Instagram claiming that drinking water at specific times of the day has specific health benefits is FALSE.The infographic contains a number of claims, including one stating that drinking two glasses of water after waking up activates the internal organs, and another adding that drinking a glass of water before a meal helps in digestion.The post adds that having a glass of water before taking a bath lowers blood pressure, while a similar amount of water before going to bed can help prevent a stroke or heart attack.However, none of the claims listed have been attributed to any authority or linked to any research findings.Water is essential for the body to function properly, and is a component of most bodily fluids. It aids in the transportation of nutrients around the body and also serves a number of essential functions in the body, including lubricating and cushioning joints, and keeping the temperature normal through the process of thermoregulation.The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention adds that the amount of water the body needs to stay hydrated and perform its functions optimally depends on a number of factors including the weather, how much physical activities one engages in, and the overall health of an individual.Health information site Healthline.com has investigated a number of claims about the benefits of drinking water right after waking up, and states that as long as the water lost by the body through sweat, breath, urine, and bowel movements is replaced, it doesn’t make much of a difference what time it is drunk.According to cardiac surgeon A. Marc Gillinov, MD, there is no ‘optimal time’ of the day to drink water. “There is no data to suggest that when you drink water matters. Choose water over most other drinks. But don’t schedule your drinking according to a fictitious claim that the time you drink it matters,” he says.Additionally, the claim that drinking two glasses of water after waking up activates the internal organs doesn’t specify which organs these are. Ms Wanjiku Wairia, a wellness strategist, told PesaCheck that the claim that a glass of water before a meal helps in digestion is also based on pseudoscience — a collection of practices mistakenly regarded as based on scientific methods.Further, Ms Wairia says that the reason water drunk in the morning, especially if a dash of lemon is added to it, creates a sense of awakening and refreshment is because a person is coming from a state of fasting. As such, the person may feel slightly thirsty. A drink of water at this time also serves to cleanse the palate in readiness for breakfast.“It’s not a matter of life and death that if you do not take water in the morning your system or internal organs will not ‘wake up’. However, it is a good habit to do so,” she added.The suggestion that internal organs need to be reactivated in the morning is also untrue, since the internal organs and processes continue working throughout the night, even through periods of inactivity when a person is asleep.What actually aids the stomach during digestion is the gastric juices that are released from the stomach wall, explains Ms Wairia.With regard to the claim that drinking a glass of water before taking a bath lowers blood pressure, Ms Wairia says there is no correlation between the two actions. The University of Washington also dismisses this claim, stating that lower blood pressure can be achieved by cutting back on salt intake and increasing physical activity.The final claim in the infographic that a glass of water before going to bed can help prevent a stroke or heart attack is also untrue. “You could still have a heart attack even after you drink water before going to bed,” Ms Wairia said.According to the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading preventable risk factors for heart disease and stroke are high blood pressure, high LDL (bad) cholesterol, smoking, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, type 2 diabetes, and obesity.PesaCheck has looked into an infographic shared on Instagram claiming that particular health benefits are associated with drinking water at specific times of the day, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

339,cow urine be used as a disinfectant?,"On 13 May, while receiving medical supplies to help mitigate COVID-19 from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok advised locals who are unable to access hand sanitisers to use cow urine to wash their hands and prevent the spread of the highly contagious virus.Governor Nanok made this statement while receiving surgical masks and hand sanitiser from UNHCR Kakuma manager Kahin Ishmael, and added that the Turkana have used cow urine to sanitise cows’ udders before milking.The consumption of urine has a long history, and has been documented in different communities in Kenya, and in various other parts of the world, including Italy, Greece, Egypt, India and China.Alternative health advocates continue to make claims about the curative properties and medicinal value of urine, stating that it can treat and even cure every ailment, from acne to cancer. In addition, claims have been made that urine can prevent and cure allergies and a wide range of infections.The claims that urine can be used as a topical disinfectant appear to be linked to the fact that it contains ammonia, a common ingredient for many surface cleaners, but using urine as a disinfectant is only recommended as a last resort when no other alternatives are available.So, the question is, can urine be used as an effective disinfectant to protect against COVID-19?PesaCheck looked into the claim that urine can be used as an effective disinfectant and found the following:Urine is a liquid by-product of metabolism in humans and many other animals largely composed of water, salt, electrolytes, and chemicals to be excreted from the body. The wastes and extra water are filtered by the kidney from the blood and sent to the urinary system as urine.Urine comprises 91–96 percent water, and contains many other components, including electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chloride, nitrogenous chemicals such as ammonia, urea and creatinine, vitamins, hormones, organic acids such as uric acid, and other organic compounds. It can be used as a component for the manufacture of fertilizer and in some cases as an antifungal pesticide and larvicide in fodder crops.Contrary to popular belief, urine is not sterile, and contains bacteria and other microorganisms, and can also cause harm if introduced into the bloodstream through a wound as it can introduce bacteria or cause infection.However, in areas where water is scarce, some communities use cow urine as a substitute for water for hygiene.The efficacy of urine as sanitizer is questionable, however. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most effective disinfectants use ethyl alcohol, at concentrations of 60–80 percent to kill viruses and to disinfect contaminated surfaces. Urine is not effective for either of these uses, and it may also introduce contaminants that could put the user at risk instead of protecting them.There is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of cow urine as a natural disinfectant and no proof that it has any medicinal benefit that meets the criteria above.Based on the evidence above, urine is not effective as a sanitizer, although it has been and continues to be used as a substitute for water in areas where the resource is scarce. Additionally, sanitizers are most effective when combined with social distancing and quarantineThe World Health Organization recommends hand sanitizer to have 60% alcohol by volume, and has published a list of ingredients that one can use to make their own sanitizer.The emphasis on sterile distilled or boiled water is due to the fact that any impurities would render the sanitizer useless.",Can
340,Infrared thermometers are not harmful to brain cells,"A tweet claiming that infrared thermometers can cause damage to brain cells is MISLEADING.The tweet contains an image with text claiming that the radiation from temperature guns kills neurons, which the post misspells as ‘neutrons’, and can lead to brain damage. The message cautions the public against having the thermometer pointed directly at the head, and instead to have their temperature taken from other parts of the body such as one’s hand or finger to avoid brain damage.However, this is not true, as Dr Ngumbau Kitheka, a resident doctor at Kenyatta Hospital, told PesaCheck in a telephone interview. According to Dr Kitheka, the infrared temperature gun does not emit any energy or radiation. On the contrary, it is the human body that emits infrared radiation that is absorbed by the thermometer gun which then interprets the body temperature from this.Human beings emit heat in the form of thermal radiation, provided the environmental temperatures are above absolute zero.Dr Leonard Mabele, a lecturer at Strathmore University, told PesaCheck that the non-contact infrared thermometer works with an inbuilt passive infrared sensor that measures the infrared emissions of an object. The sensor in the thermometer gun interprets these infrared emissions from the body as temperature, and reflects this as a numeric value.The laser beam emitted by the thermometer gun is used to help accurately pin-point at an object to be measured.While thermometer guns were originally meant to measure the temperature of moving objects and inaccessible surfaces, they are currently being utilized at airports, shopping malls, hospitals and other public areas to screen people’s temperatures without the need for close contact, thereby minimizing the risk of infection.An elevated temperature is one way of identifying a person who may have COVID-19 infection. The Food, and Drug Administration (FDA) says the use of infrared thermometers reduces the risk of cross-contamination and minimizes the spread of the virus.Kenya Bureau of Standards has, however, stressed that the infrared thermometers must be properly calibrated and certified to establish their overall functionality, accuracy and reliability, as well as minimize the uncertainty of the measurements from screening. KEBS says a failure to do so could lead to false results and misdiagnosis from screening.PesaCheck has looked into a Twitter post claiming that infrared thermometers are harmful to brain cells and finds it is FALSEThis post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
341,2.6 million Kenyans have COVID-19 as reported by The Star?,"In June 2020, KEMRI and Wellcome Trust released a preliminary report on SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence among blood donors in Kenya from a study to determine the level of COVID-19 exposure in Kenya. The findings were based on 2,535 blood samples donated between May and June, and estimated that over 2.6 million people may be exposed to COVID-19.The samples were collected from blood donors, and looked into the prevalence of antibodies in the blood that would indicate previous COVID-19 infection. From the testing data, it was clear that many more Kenyans have already been exposed to COVID-19 than have been identified by surveillance activities, including widespread testing in hotspots such as Kawangware and Eastleigh in Nairobi and Old Town in Mombasa.However, The Star wrongly interpreted the data, running a headline indicating that 2.6 million Kenyans were already infected with COVID-19, which appears to be a misrepresentation of the report’s claim that 2.6 million Kenyans may be exposed to the disease.On July 6, President Uhuru Kenyatta relaxed some of the country’s COVID-19 containment measures, including lifting cessation of movement limitations and reopening places of worship. However, the nationwide night-time curfew is still in force in an effort to contain the spread of the disease.The state has increased testing, closed international borders with Somalia and Tanzania, and banned public gatherings. As of July 6, the number of infections hit 8,067 out of 191,394 samples tested.In March, the Ministry of Health had projected that the total number of coronavirus infections in the country could rise to 10,000 by the end of April. At the time, MoH Director-General Dr Patrick Amoth revealed that the Health Ministry only had the capacity to test 300 samples in 24 hours. At the time, the country only had 2 labs in Nairobi, but this was increased to 20 labs in 10 counties.By the end of May, the country had recorded 1,962 confirmed cases with 78,536 samples tested.Africa has over 460,000 COVID-19 cases, with South Africa leading with 205,721 cases and 3,199 deaths linked to the disease, having conducted 1,864,11 tests so far. Egypt has reported about 76,222 cases and almost 3,422 deaths with over one million tests conducted. The South African government had projected that the cases could reach almost 100,000 by August, but by July, the numbers had risen beyond the projection.Since the first case was reported in March 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19-related deaths in Kenya has so far reached 164, with 2,414 recoveries.Out of Kenya’s 47 counties, Nairobi leads with the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by Mombasa, with Busia and Kajiado third and fourth respectively.The KEMRI report relied on a convenient sample, where the source of data is used because it is readily available rather than collected at random. While the ideal method to determine exposure rate is by using a random selection of different samples, sampling was limited due to constraints created by the current lockdown, hence the use of a convenient sample. The research team also cautioned that the sample used for analysis might not be applicable to the general population.In this instance, the data was collected from blood donation samples, which already excludes the people most likely to be affected by COVID-19 — those aged over 55, and those suffering from pre-existing conditions such as hypertension. The data, therefore, is not an accurate representation of those who may be at risk from the disease.The prevalence rate across the country was 5.3 percent while also predicting that over 2.6 million may be exposed to COVID-19, testing for antibodies in a way that can be used to determine the COVID-19 exposure level in a population even after those exposed have recovered.Currently, testing to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is done by collecting a sample of mucus using a nasal swab, and running a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which looks for the genetic material of the coronavirus. The test amplifies the viral genetic material if present, confirming that a person is actively infected.Testing for antibodies, which is what the KEMRI report covers, identifies people who have previously been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 by checking if their immune systems have ever been exposed to the virus. This test does not show whether a person is currently infected.While the antibody test is a good way to track the spread of the COVID-19 in a population, it is not an indication of active infections, which need a PCR test. The headline in The Star implies that all those who may have been infected still have the infection, which is inaccurate.Nairobi and Mombasa were found to have the highest number of potential infections with a prevalence rate of 12.4 percent and 8.6 percent respectively, followed by Kisumu with 7.5 percent and Machakos at 6.2 percent.The Ministry of Health initiated the study with KEMRI-Wellcome Trust to find out how many Kenyans might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus in the last few months. Speaking at the daily COVID-19 media briefing on July 3, Health Chief Administrative Secretary Dr Rashid Aman, also noted that the sampling might not give a true representation of the county as the selected size was fairly small.Mr Edwine Baraza, the Programme Director at KEMRI Nairobi, who spoke at the briefing, also indicated that the findings were in the preliminary stage and that the 2,535 blood donors are not a representation of the whole population.",Do

346,A study has found that infectious droplets spreading COVID-19 travel further than previously thought,"An article claiming that results from a recent study show coronavirus can spread through the air to distances beyond what was previously believed is TRUE.The study found that droplets of moisture expelled when an infected person coughs or sneezes are of different sizes and, while larger droplets quickly fall to the ground, those smaller than five micrometers remain suspended in the air. These small droplets can spread further than the 1-meter distance stated by the World Health Organization carrying the virus with them. This makes the airborne spread of COVID-19 a bigger threat than was believed.In a commentary submitted with the scientific report, which has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Clinical Infectious Disease, the two researchers say that studies have shown “beyond any reasonable doubt that viruses are released during exhalation, talking and coughing in microdroplets small enough to remain aloft in the air.”The new data suggests that people could be at greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 than was previously thought, particularly in close indoor conditions.The research has been reviewed by an international team of 239 experts who have signed the commentary and are now calling on the World Health Organization to revise its recommendations on the airborne transmission of the disease, taking into consideration these findings.WHO has long held that SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, is primarily spread by large respiratory droplets that once expelled by infected people through coughs and sneezes, fall quickly on the ground or floor. The organization has previously dismissed the possibility of airborne transmission, except during certain high-risk medical procedures, such as when patients are first put on breathing machines.On July 7, the WHO acknowledged evidence emerging of the airborne spread of COVID-19 after receiving the commentary signed by the 239 scientists.Speaking at a press briefing in Geneva, Prof Benedetta Allegranzi, the WHO’s technical lead for infection prevention and control, said there was evidence emerging of airborne transmission of the coronavirus, but that it was not definitive.Prof Allegranzi said that the possibility of airborne transmission in public settings especially in crowded, closed, poorly ventilated areas that have been described in the study cannot be ruled out.“However, the evidence needs to be gathered and interpreted, and we continue to support this,” she said.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that a study by two scientists indicates there is evidence to show that COVID-19 is airborne, and finds it TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:
347,Travellers leaving Nairobi do not need a COVID-19 certificate,"A Facebook post claiming that travellers leaving Nairobi would require a COVID-19 negative certificate to travel is FALSE.The post states that those wishing to travel out of Nairobi city county must have a current certificate — not more than 14 days old — stating that they have tested negative for COVID-19.President Uhuru Kenyatta announce a phased re-opening of the country on 6 July, lifting cessation of movement into and out of Nairobi, Mombasa and Mandera counties, which had previously been restricted.Speaking to PesaCheck on the phone, Government spokesperson Colonel Cyrus Oguna stated that the claim is false, noting that the president’s directive did not include a requirement for people traveling from Nairobi to have a valid COVID-19 certificate.“The only condition that the president placed on travel outside Nairobi, is that of personal responsibility. All of us should be responsible so as not to spread COVID-19 to our family members residing outside Nairobi and other towns where the movement of people into and outside had been restricted,” Colonel Oguna said.Mr Oguna added that the Ministry of Health does not require one to have a COVID-19 certificate to travel out of the areas that had been placed under cessation.In his address to the nation, President Kenyatta further stated that the movement of passengers into and out of areas previously under cessation of movement would only be allowed for transport service providers that are compliant with the protocols developed by the Ministry of Health.“To operate public service vehicles, the operators will require mandatory certification from the Ministry of Health, in consultation with the Ministry of Transport,” President Kenyatta said.The president, however, cautioned that the orders to re-open these areas are conditional, saying that should the COVID-19 situation deteriorate and pose a challenge to the country’s health infrastructure, then the cessation of movement order would be reinstated.”While restrictions on movement were eased, President Kenyatta announced an extension of the nationwide curfew by a further 30 days.Kenya has recorded a total of 8,528 COVID-19 cases and 169 deaths since March 13, when the first case was reported in the country.PesaCheck has looked into a post claiming that one must have a COVID-19 certificate to travel out of Nairobi, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
348,This Facebook page offering cash giveaways alongside an image of Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is fake,"A Facebook account with a photo of actor Dwayne Johnson, popularly known as ‘The Rock’, and offering cash prizes is FAKE.The page contains a number of posts, including one asking users to find the first letter of their name on an alphabetical list, which will determine what prize they will get.The post asks those interested in taking part to share the post to five Facebook groups in order to increase their chances of winning as much as $60 million.While the posts and the page do not specifically state that the gifts are from Mr Johnson, his image features prominently alongside images of stacks of dollar bills.Despite the promise that winners will receive their money within 15 minutes of applying, no clear procedure for how the money will be disbursed is provided.A reverse image search reveals that this same photo of Mr Johnson has been featured in a number of online scams, and has been subject to several fact check articles.The Facebook account, named Dicko, features the image of a smiling Dwayne Johnson as the profile photo, while the cover photo shows another image of him with a stash of cash behind him.However, a reverse image search shows that the photo was published by MTV alongside a news feature in October 2017, and does not include stacks of cash behind Mr Johnson. This indicates that the image on the page has been manipulated to include the image of the money.Additionally, Mr Johnson’s Facebook page does not contain any giveaways.In September 2018, Mr Johnson took to Instagram to warn the public against phony Facebook accounts using his image and likeness to promote fake giveaways.‘Sorry if you’ve been affected by these fake Facebook accounts asking for money or worse yet, actually engaged with them enough to send money in.

349,It is not possible to determine the expiry date of a car tyre from the numbers on its sidewall,"A Facebook post claiming that you can tell the expiry date of a tyre by reading the four-digit number stamped on its sidewall is FALSE.According to the post, the numbers on a car tyre indicate the week and year of manufacture, and this can be used to calculate its age. The first two digits represent the week that the tyre was manufactured, while the last two digits represent the year of manufacture.The post further states that the ‘safe life’ of a tyre is up to four years after the date of manufacture, and recommends that a tyre be replaced once expiry is reached to avoid the risk of a burst.PesaCheck contacted Vinay Luthra, the general manager of Nairobi-based Aum Auto (K) Ltd which specializes in rebuilding automobiles, who confirmed that it is possible to tell the date of manufacture of a car tyre by looking at the four-digit number written on its sidewall.“The claim is true. The four digits are standalone and do not have any additional letters. Some manufacturers place an asterisk before and after the four digits while others simply encycle it,” Mr Luthra adds.According to Siju Aravindan, head of business at Car & General’s MRF Tyres, the lifespan of a tyre can extend beyond the four years claimed on the Facebook post if they are stored properly.“Tyre manufacturers generally distribute tyres within a year, and dealerships will stock up the tyres for retail. If it is stored properly, it can last several years without any damage.”Aravindan adds that for normal usage, the use of tyres aged five or six years is okay. But if the tyres are required for high-performance use like racing or testing, it is recommended one uses very recently manufactured ones.His sentiments are echoed by Jim Killi, a mechanical engineering student at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT).“Expiry date depends on various factors. It is not definite. Tyres manufactured in recent years have benefited from advances in technology, new methods of manufacturing and materials which allow the tyre to last for up to 10 years depending on use. In any case, most tyre treads will wear out before expiry becomes an issue,” says Mr Killi.Storage is also a determining factor of the condition of a tyre before it is sold. “If a distributor stores the tyres in a godown that is hot, and perhaps the tyre comes into contact with a solvent such as oil, its condition can deteriorate and it is unlikely that its performance will be optimum,” adds Mr Aravindan.Similarly, the safety of a tyre is also dependent on how it’s been used and the percentage of the tread, and it is not definitively capped at four years, adds Billy Namale, a content contributor at the Motoring Press Agency.“The four-year rule is a safety recommendation for motorists, like how manufacturers give fuel economy figures on their cars. Those figures assume certain parameters. You can exceed or better those figures depending on your driving techniques,” says Mr Namale.“Let’s say I buy a car, put on new tyres and store the car in a dust-free airlock for four years. Will you still say the tyres are dangerous and need to be changed? For one, I have taken precautions to ensure there is basically zero wear and tear plus I have greatly slowed down its degradation,” adds Mr Namale.Based on the Japanese Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association (JATMA), tyre manufacturer Bridgestone recommends that all tires be inspected at five years, and all tires that were manufactured more than ten years previously be replaced. Bridgestone also recommends that vehicle owners follow the recommendations for replacement given by the tyre manufacturer regardless of appearance, mileage or actual wear of the tyre.Regulations for the date code and other tyre markings are drawn from the World Forum for the Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations, or WP.29 as it is commonly known, which fall under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).Regulation 106 specifies the format for the date of manufacture stamped on the tyre sidewall as well as specifications for the manufacturer’s trade name and tyre size among other regulatory markings. The regulation does not specify the expiry date.However, manufacturers are currently free to use whatever technology they choose. Industry regulators only set the minimum standards to ensure the tyre is viable for use in vehicles, Mr Killi explains.Although WP.29 tyre regulations have taken root in Europe, they are not globally binding and countries may set their own standards, creating challenges for the tyre industry.“Some countries specify and even prohibit the sale of tyres that are older than a set number of years from the manufacturing date,” adds Mr Aravindan.In Kenya, standards for tyres are included in the KS 1515 Standard Code of practice for inspection of road vehicles set by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), which lists a number of conditions for inspection of tyres for defects, including whether its walls are in contact, if bulging is present, evidence of fouling (accumulation of unwanted material on the surface) or incorrect inflation. Tyres are also checked for breaks in fabric or cut which is more than 25 mm long or 10 percent of tread width and whether the tread is worn beyond the legal limit. However, the age of the tyre is not mentioned.Meanwhile, WP.29 continues to set standards for motor vehicles in Europe and other countries that have signed onto the agreement and UN regulations on automated vehicles and digitally connected vehicles released in June 2020PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the expiry of the tyre is capped at four years from its date of manufacture and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
350,Flu vaccines do not make people more vulnerable to infections,"A screenshot shared on Facebook claiming that people who get flu shots would be the first to die in an actual pandemic because they have been made vulnerable to infection is FALSE.The screenshot appears to have been taken from an article purportedly published by WorldHealth.net, a non-profit online resource of non-commercial health information.However, a search on the website does not show the article in question.The post also claims that the flu shot narrative is ‘a medical hoax pushed by the vaccine industry’ and that it is easily disproved by fact-based evidence, stating that people who had a flu shot in 2008 experienced a 250 percent increase in influenza infections in subsequent years. However, there is no mention of the source of this information.A flu vaccine protects people from contracting influenza, a viral infection that attacks the respiratory system. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that priority groups, such as pregnant women, the elderly, young children, people with underlying diseases, and health care workers, who are deemed to be at a higher risk of developing flu complications, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations.Some flu vaccines contain Thimerosal, an organic form of mercury known as ethylmercury. Thimerosal is used as a preservative in vials containing more than one dose of medicines and vaccines. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that there is no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines, except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site.Single-dose vials, pre-filled syringes, and nasal sprays do not need to include Thimerosal, because contamination is not an issueThe WHO says there is no evidence that the vaccinations can make people more susceptible to infections of any kind, not even COVID-19.According to a statement by the WHO, seasonal flu vaccination does not compromise an individual’s immunity.“Seasonal flu immunization does not impact a person’s likelihood of getting COVID-19”, the WHO statement read in part, adding, “Vaccines stimulate the body’s own immune system to protect the person against subsequent infection or disease”.The WHO has published operational guidelines on maintaining essential health services in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which include urging countries to implement seasonal influenza vaccinations.Additionally, the screenshot claims that a study published in Human & Environmental Toxicology found that mercury-laced flu vaccines caused a 4,250 percent increase in fetal deaths during the 2009 flu season.However, the study, which was published in the Journal on Human and Experimental Toxicology, did not establish such a link.The study examined fetal loss reports during three consecutive influenza seasons (2008–2009) found a 4,250 percent increase in fetal-loss during the period in review, but it did not link the mortality directly to the flu vaccines.The study looked at the number of inactivated-influenza vaccine–related spontaneous abortion and stillbirth reports listed by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in US-licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The study cited limits in the ability to determine reporting completeness of fetal losses associated with the period under review. It also suggests additional research concerning potential risk factors associated with the administration of the said vaccines, and that the association between exposure and effect should be verified in further toxicological and case-control studies.Therefore, while the Facebook post claims that a definitive link was found between the flu vaccine and fetal mortality, the study cited as definitive proof states that it was not possible to determine whether the fetal losses associated with the 2008/2009 and 2010/2011 seasons were because of the vaccine, and called for further toxicological and case–control studies.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the influenza vaccine makes people more vulnerable to infections and therefore more likely to die in a pandemic, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

She bases her argument on a study carried out by Swedish researchers in 2009, which revealed a new genetic mutation that may confer some level of resistance to HIV.According to the study, cells with high levels of Pk, a protein found on the surface of several types of blood cells, are significantly harder to infect with HIV than cells with no Pk.But while this case of genetic resistance has played an important role in research for a functional cure, Dr Boskey cautioned that it would be grossly premature to say that blood type can protect against HIV infection.“Pk is a way of typing blood. However, it is not commonly used and not part of either the A/B/O or Rh typing systems,” she writes.Moreover, the study only looked at in vitro susceptibility and studies have yet to be conducted in a living organism.The article published on Opera News appears to promote an online dating site for HIV-positive individuals, and contains text directly contradicting the headline.PesaCheck has looked into an article published by online content aggregator Opera News, claiming that people with a particular blood type can never contract HIV/AIDS, and finds it has a FALSE HEADLINE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE

The guidelines also advise that patients be released only when there are no household members who may be at increased risk of complications from COVID-19 infections.Mr Kagwe said the 600 patients — 338 from Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital and 212 from Coast General Hospital — would be the first cases released to this programme. The programme is scheduled to be extended to patients from medical facilities across the country, the CS said.The adoption of home-based care is aimed at relieving pressure on the country’s medical system as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise exponentially.Additionally, Kenya is adopting a community-based approach as a preventive measure against the spread of COVID-19.

It stirred controversy particularly for calling out a section of the elite perceived to be using their inherited wealth and power to oppress the poor.The song criticises the demolition of houses in Kariobangi in Nairobi, which led to the displacement of hundreds of people, saying the move was ill-timed given the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic.However, the article itself neither repeats the claim made in the headline, nor mentions when the musician was arrested and where he was taken.It is true that the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) summoned the musician over concerns that the song threatens harmonious coexistence among communities. He was directed to appear before the commission on June 26, 2020.While a summons requires a person to present themselves voluntarily before a body, an arrest means one is seized and placed under custody.

369,Shaking a cooking gas cylinder does not cause it to explode,"A Facebook post claiming that shaking a cooking gas cylinder can cause it to explode is FALSE.The post asks people to share the information contained, and claims that ‘gas explosion’ caused by shaking the cylinder is potentially lethal. These explosions, the ad claims, are responsible for a growing number of deaths, but it does not specify where the deaths have occurred.The post suggests wetting the side of the cylinder with water is a safer alternative to shaking it, stating that after a while, the lower part of the cylinder with gas will remain wet, while the dry part shows the quantity of gas that has been used.Responding to PesaCheck, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) refuted the claim that shaking a gas cylinder can cause an explosion.“Explosion only occurs in the event of a BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion) reaction”, the EPRA noted, “which usually happens when a cylinder is subjected to external heat”.BLEVE refers to an explosion caused by the rupture of a vessel containing a pressurized liquid that has reached temperatures above its boiling point. Once the cylinder holding the gas can no longer contain the pressure inside it due to the high temperatures, the vessel bursts open resulting in an explosion.Gitau Muhiah from the Petroleum Gas department at EPRA, also discounted the claim.“The LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) working pressure is normally 8 bars but the cylinder can withstand up to 30 bars of pressure so explosion due to shaking is near impossible. One of the properties of LPG is that it is very cold hence causing cold burns,” Mr Muhiah told PesaCheck via email.Moreover, EPRA attributes recent reports of domestic gas cylinder explosions such as one that occurred in November 2019 in Muthurwa, to lack of safe handling and use of LPG among other causes.The authority, however, agrees that the alternative method of determining the remaining gas content by wetting one side of the cylinder as proposed in the Facebook post contains some truth.“The principle would be that the portion occupied by LPG is much cooler than that not occupied thus this portion would tend to stay wet after some time while the other portion dries up,” the authority stated.While wetting the side of the cylinder can help to estimate the gas levels, EPRA says there are cylinders available in the market which make it possible to actually see what amount of gas is left.Another safe way of checking the remaining content in an LPG cylinder is to weigh it on a scale and subtract the tare weight. The weight of the empty cylinder is usually stamped on it.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that shaking a cooking gas cylinder can cause it to explode, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

One user called on US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to intervene against police brutality, claiming that the victim in the video was from Biafra.The claim that the clip on the tweet is from Nigeria could be due to the fact that both countries have very similar police uniforms.

374,back at 100 days of COVID-19 in Kenya,"BY SILAS APOLLOWhen the first case of the coronavirus was announced in Kenya on March 12, 2020, the cabinet secretary for health, Mutahi Kagwe, said that the government had foreseen the virus crossing borders and getting into the country, and that it was a matter of when, not if, the first case would be confirmed.To some, this statement was interpreted to mean that the government, was in some way, prepared for any eventuality, and that all the necessary precautions had been taken to prepare not just the public, but also put in place systems to manage the crisis, and mitigate it should it multiply to uncontrollable levels.This first case was reported months after the novel coronavirus had caused massive economic and social disruptions in China, where it was first reported in December, before it spread to other countries like Italy, where statistics indicated that infections and deaths were in the figures of hundreds of thousands.Before the announcement by CS Kagwe, there was panic among Kenyans after reports that individuals likely to have been exposed to the disease, such as Kilifi deputy governor Gideon Saburi, had failed to self-quarantine, something that many saw as a general disregard for the rules put in place to prevent the spread the virus.Additionally, questions about the state of the country’s preparedness arose after a security officer attached to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport was suspended for allegedly recording a video of a Southern Airlines plane from China landing at JKIA, despite assurances by the government that it had restricted entry of airplanes from affected countries into Kenya.Nonetheless, the virus hit home, with the number of new infections rising by the day. On the 100th day since the first case was reported, Kenya reported the highest number of new infections to date, with 260 new cases on June 21.Despite the continued threat posed by the virus, the focus seems to have shifted to reopening the country and relaxing lockdown measures, with businesses such as restaurants that were closed now open, albeit with reduced capacity. Old Town in Mombasa and Eastleigh in Nairobi, which had emerged as hotspots for community spread, were subsequently locked down, and later reopened when transmission numbers had dropped.Additional measures put in place by the government to ‘flatten the curve’ and contain the spread of the virus — including banning social gatherings and enforcing a dusk to dawn curfew — seem to be working, with Kenyans adhering to the rules set out by the government for the most part.However, enforcement of these measures seems inconsistent, especially the curfew and restrictions on movement into and out of Nairobi. It appears that these regulations failed to consider the impact of COVID-19 on the country’s fragile economy, and may have worsened the impact of this on the urban population, a majority of who are in the informal sector and who live from hand to mouth.Most importantly, questions have been asked about the state of Kenya’s healthcare system, and its ability to handle a crisis in the event that the number of new infections continues to rise, as has been projected by the government.Kenya’s public healthcare system is woefully inadequate, and data from the World Health Organisation shows that the country not only suffers a critical shortage of health personnel, but also of the equipment to supplement provision of healthcare.While county governments have put much effort in place to strengthen the provision and delivery of healthcare after taking over this function in 2013, more still needs to be done. The public health sector has been hit by repeated strikes and threats of industrial action over low pay and broken agreements.A 2018 report by the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Board puts the number of registered doctors in the country at 11,334, excluding dentists.Of this figure, only 6,394 were active as of 2018, according to KMPDB. This number, calculated against the country’s population of 47.5 million people as indicated by the 2019 census, means that the doctor-to-patient ratio stands at one doctor for every 7,500 patients.WHO on the other hand, recommends an average of one doctor to every 300 patients.Consequently, WHO estimates that every year, about 40 percent of graduates from medical schools in the least developed nations like Kenya look for opportunities in other countries, denying the country its much-needed human capital.What this means is that should Kenya’s trajectory of new infections follow the trend witnessed in China, Italy or even the United States, the country’s healthcare system may not only be compromised, but could also collapse. To make matters worse, healthcare workers are also contracting the virus, further reducing the number of personnel available to fight the pandemic.Crucially, the number of ICU beds, which would be used in the event that COVID-19 patients need urgent critical care, was also called into question after data showed there were only 518 beds in total for a population of 47 million.However, the government has consistently argued that it was prepared for the worst-case scenario, with CS Kagwe at one point indicating that the country has put up at least 1,000 ICU beds should matters worsen.But data from both public and private hospitals show otherwise. A study done by the Kenya Healthcare Federation shows that the country currently has about 314 ICU beds, mostly in private hospitals. Even with this number, only 259 have functioning ventilators. But that is not all. There is a shortage of personnel to run the machines, something that dims the already strained statistics even further.A 2019 report by the WHO indicates that in least developed countries — Kenya included — 22 percent of the health care facilities have no water service, 21 percent no sanitation service, and 22 percent no waste management service.While emphasis has also been on personal hygiene, including washing hands, the messaging seems to put undue significance on the need to wash hands with running water, a resource that many households sadly lack, as the data on access to clean and safe water points out.Studies on access to clean water in the country’s informal settlements, like one done by The National Centre for Biotechnology Information, shows that while access to clean water has increased over time — from 60 percent in 2010 to 63 percent in 2015 — not much difference has been felt in informal settlements which houses the majority of the urban populace — about 60 percent for the case of Nairobi. Kibra, for instance, has 2.5 million residents, according to statistics by the government.The report further indicates that a lack of sanitation contributes to approximately 700,000 child deaths every year due to diarrhoea, mostly in slums where sanitation and access to clean water is at its poorest.For many in these areas, the delicate balance, as reported in a number of media outlets, has been the balance between fending for their basic needs like food and shelter, while at the same time, adhering to the basic standards set out by the government.",Looking
375,to recognize a fake newspaper front page on social media,"Over the last few weeks, Kenyan social media has been awash with front pages of the country’s leading newspapers — The Daily Nation, The Standard, and The Star — with sensational headlines and images of prominent individuals.The growing number of fake front pages is an indication of how easy it is to manipulate legitimate photos published by news outlets and share them online on messaging and social media platforms.As Kenyans increasingly get their information online, as well as follow news organizations online to get information as it breaks, what we are seeing is an online manifestation of a phenomenon that was previously more common offline.News organizations previously ignored these fake front pages, because they could trust their audiences to find the legitimate edition of the paper. However, given the implications of these fake front pages on their brands, newsrooms are taking the issue head-on, and are publishing the fake images alongside the genuine front pages on their social media platforms, as well as working with police to address the problem.The doctored front pages seen by PesaCheck tend to prey on people in the news, and feature names of prominent personalities whose public stature helps the viral spread of politically motivated disinformation. The political nature of the fake pages and stories suggests that seek to achieve a particular political purpose, we are seeing increased incidents of false information creeping in and sowing confusion in the public space.This is, however, not the first time Kenya has had front pages with fake and politically motivated front pages news headlines. During the 2017 general elections, fake news spread both online and offline through such methods.In Busia for instance, leaflets with images of a fake Daily Nation front page announced that Paul Otuoma, a gubernatorial candidate contesting for the Orange Democratic Party primary in Busia, had defected from his party and had joined the Jubilee party. The leaflets with this information were shared widely with the aim of tainting the candidate’s popularity, and may have contributed to his loss in the primary.On May 27, an image of a fake front page of The Standard was shared on Facebook announcing that the Deputy President’s wife, Rachel Ruto, had gone into hiding. On May 28, a fake Daily Nation front page was shared on Facebook announcing that the government had frozen Deputy President William Ruto’s bank accounts.On June 9, a fake Daily Nation front page claiming that Chief Justice David Maraga had held a clandestine meeting with Deputy President William Ruto in a plot to dissolve Parliament was shared online.All these front pages have digitally altered headlines, and some even reused the image featured on the front page, which may have been an attempt to pass them off as different editions of the same paper.In June 2020 police, working with Kenya Copyright Authority arrested a suspect believed to be behind some of the fake headlines circulating online as well as the illegal sale of pirated news copy. Manipulation and sharing of content without the owners’ authority is covered by the Copyright Act (2001), and attracts legal penalties.More of the manipulated newspaper front pages that PesaCheck has looked into are one from the Star claiming that Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria was a ‘double agent’, and one from The Daily Nation claiming that businessman Jimmy Wanjigi was involved in the Arror and Kimwarer dams scandal.The front page is the most visible part of the newspaper, and often contains the story that the newsroom considers most striking and important. It gives the reader an idea of the main story that they will find in the publication, as well as any additional stories that may be of interest.Mainstream media houses have taken to publishing images of their newspaper front page each day on their official social media platforms. As a result, it is easier to find the legitimate front page and compare it with any images shared online.The manipulators often use authentic images used in a different context, changing the headline and image featured as the main story, and adding a false headline and a short blurb. Once this is done, the images are often shared on popular groups and tweeted using trending hashtags to make them more visible and spark outrage.The fonts, colours, and layout used in the doctored front pages are very similar to what is used on the authentic front pages, making them more convincing. Additionally, the smaller stories featured on the front page are often retained as is, with the only change being on the main headline and featured image.The simplest way to verify if a front page shared online is authentic is to check the website and social media platforms of the media house in question to see if the image matches what they have shared.Additionally, the front page font may be slightly different from what the papers actually use, so it is also useful to compare the front page with other front pages published by the media house.Small details such as the date format and even the issue number can be used as an indicator that the front page may be fake. Some items may also be blurred on a doctored front page, whereas images of genuine front pages usually have readable text on all items on the front page.Thirdly, the reader can cross-check the information with other credible news outlets, including traditional media, social media, friends, or colleagues one can counter check with.To find out whether the front page is legitimate, we first do a reverse image search to see if the photo has been shared elsewhere. Additionally, we look at the media house’s social media accounts, as well as the person featured on the front page to see if they have posted anything that can be used to authenticate the story.We also reach out to the media house involved to check if they are aware of the front page and if they have an official response to it. Once this is done, we compile the information into a fact-check and share it alongside the false content, warning viewers that what they are seeing is not authentic.While the growing frequency of false and manipulated newspaper front pages is cause for concern, the fact that media houses are responding and giving their audiences a clear picture of what is authentic and what isn’t means that it is far less likely, albeit still possible, for people to fall for this false content.",How
376,This statement showing countries that voted for Djibouti in the UNSC elections is fake,"A tweet with a list of countries that allegedly voted for Djibouti and against Kenya in elections for a seat on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is FAKE.The tweet was posted on June 21 by Robert Alai, and was also shared by lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi, and claims to show that Tanzania, Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia, which neighbour Kenya, voted against the country’s bid for a non-permanent seat on the UNSC in the June 18 poll. Kenya was up against Djibouti in the elections.However, Security Council elections are held by secret ballot according to Rule 92 of the United Nations Rules of Procedure, and the results only show how many votes each candidate got, not how the votes were cast. Therefore, it would be unprocedural for the UN to disclose how each country voted.The June 18 statement, circulating online, was supposedly signed by an unnamed returning officer at the UNSC and contains glaring mistakes. Kosovo, which is mentioned twice in the list, is not recognised as an independent state by the UN. Likewise, North Korea, also named in the fake statement, is recognised by the UN as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Both Kenya and Djibouti failed to secure a two-thirds majority vote in the first round of elections held on June 17. This prompted the president of the General Assembly, Mr Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, to call for a second round of elections to fill the non-permanent member seat reserved for African states.A statement by His Excellency Volkan Bozkir, the President of the General Assembly dated June 17 contained the list of countries eligible to vote, and Kosovo was not among them. North Korea is included in Mr Bozkir’s statement, but as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, its official name as is recognized by the United Nations.The UN director at the International Crisis Group, Mr Richard Gowan, tweeted on June 20, noting several inaccuracies in the statement that indicate that it could be fake. Mr Gowan noted that election results are administered by the president of the General Assembly, and not by the UNSC as the statement claims.PesaCheck has looked into a statement claiming to show the list of countries that voted for Djibouti in the June 18 election for Africa’s non-permanent seat at the UN Security Council and finds it to be FAKE.",FALSE:

378,IEBC is not working with ThirdWay Alliance to introduce a new referendum bill,"An article by The Star claiming that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is working with the ThirdWay Alliance Party to introduce a new referendum bill is MISLEADING.According to the post, published on June 16, the IEBC chairman, Wafula Chebukati, and the ThirdWay Alliance Party leader, Ekuru Aukot, met to discuss an alternative referendum bill to be presented to the commission before the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) launches its final report.ThirdWay Alliance introduced a bill dubbed the Punguza Mizigo Initiative in 2019, which proposed amendments to the Constitution of Kenya 2010 as envisioned in Article 257. In July the same year, IEBC cleared the initiative for the next phase as it was supported by over 1.2 million registered voters. However, the bill died at the county level after failing to garner enough support from county assemblies.On February 17, Ekuru Aukot relaunched a second bid for the constitutional change with new recommendations.The article alleges that Mr Aukot’s party is racing to have a referendum ahead of the one proposed by the BBI.The BBI submitted a report to President Uhuru Kenyatta in November 2019. The president, however, extended the term for the task force team to draw up an actionable implementation plan.However, in a statement released on June 12, the IEBC denied that they were working with ThirdWay Alliance to develop a new referendum bill, advising the public to disregard the story.The ThirdWay Alliance Party also dismissed the story in a tweet, saying they were not aware of any meeting between their elections team and the IEBC boss.The Star has since taken down the article.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the IEBC is working with ThirdWay Alliance Party to introduce a new referendum bill and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
379,This photo of a man breaking COVID-19 restrictions to propose to his girlfriend in Murang’a is actually from Malawi,"A tweet with an image claiming to show a Kenyan man defying COVID-19 restrictions to propose to his girlfriend in Murang’a is FALSE.According to the post, dated June 18, Mr Maxwell Oketch hired a chopper at Wilson Airport and flew over numerous roadblocks to Kabati, Murang’a to propose to his girlfriend.A number of people responded to the tweet by asking how Mr Oketch managed to travel out of Nairobi in light of the current travel restrictions into and out of the Nairobi metropolitan area, which President Uhuru Kenyatta extended by 30 days on June 6.Further, the chopper’s identification number — ZS-RWS — is South African, not Kenyan. Aircraft registered in Kenya have registrations starting with 5W.A reverse image search shows that the photo dates back to February 2018, when Malawian gospel musician Duncan Zgambo, also known as Gwamba, proposed to his girlfriend Kondi in South Africa.The artist reportedly spent about $15,000 (approximately Ksh1.5 million) to hire the chopper and book a venue at the Sparkling Waters Hotel in Rustenberg, South Africa for the proposal. The two flew over 120 kilometres from Pretoria to Rustenberg.Gwamba married his girlfriend in October 2018.PesaCheck has looked into the post claiming to show a Kenyan man defying COVID-19 restrictions to propose to his girlfriend in Murang’a on June 18 and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:
380,The COVID-19 Exposure Notifications feature does not ‘secretly install’ tracking apps on your phone,"A tweet claiming that recent updates to Android and iOS operating systems added a COVID-19 contact tracing system without user permission is FALSE.The post claims that the updates were installed during a period of service disruption, and includes a screenshot of the feature as it appears on an Android phone.However, this appears to be a misunderstanding of the nature of the update.While the “COVID-19 Exposure Logging” feature is a contact tracing system available on both iPhone and Android phones, the feature does not install any apps, and users have to download an application developed by their government or health institution to get information.The Exposure Logging tool enables mobile phone users to know whether they have come in close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus.Exposure Logging was introduced as part of iOS 13.5 on May 20, and as an update on Google Play Services for Android devices. Both Apple and Google have explained that the apps are still being reviewed before being made available on the respective app stores, to ensure they are not collecting private user data.The Exposure Notification feature is only available to apps either made or authorized by official health institutions or government bodies. When a compatible app is downloaded, the phone will then prompt the user to confirm that they want to use Exposure Notifications. The system is opt-in at every stage.Searching for ‘contact tracing’ on the Google Play Store in Kenya, for example, shows that no apps have been authorized and endorsed by authorities in the country, and therefore none can access the Exposure Notification function.The software update release notes for iOS 13.5 state that users need to enable the feature and install an app from a public health authority in order to receive notifications if they have been in close proximity to an individual who has tested positive. In the event of a match, indicating that someone they may have interacted with has tested positive, the user may be notified and advised on next steps.Apple and Google announced in April that they would collaborate on contact tracing to help in the fight against COVID-19. In May, the two companies issued a joint statement to clarify that the product is actually not an app, but rather an application programming interface (API) that public health agencies can incorporate into their own apps. Users must still install a compatible app that works with the new feature from a recognised public health agent.Apart from the option to opt-in to Exposure Notifications, the technology does not track users’ location, and it is up to the individual to report potential exposure to the public health app they may be using. iPhone owners have to update to iOS 13.5 in order to have access to Exposure Notifications. Android users will receive the update automatically through Google Play Services.The privacy protections are designed to encourage confidence and use of the API as the widespread adoption of the technology is critical to its success.This claim has also been debunked by tech sites 9to5Mac and ZDNet.PesaCheck has looked into a post claiming that recent Android and iOS system updates installed the COVID-19 contact tracing system without users’ permission, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

385,President Uhuru Kenyatta’s claims on Kenyan tea production,"In an address to the nation in January 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta spoke at length about Kenya’s leading role in the black tea market and agricultural opportunities to benefit all Kenyans.Mr Kenyatta’s address came at a time when farmers were complaining about poor prices for their produce — a complaint that cuts across the tea, coffee and dairy sectors. In his address, the president highlighted the government’s roadmap to turnaround the economy to benefit local farmers, traders and all Kenyans amid growing concern at the hard economic times.From the address, PesaCheck looked at three claims made by the president and found the following:Claim 1: Kenya remains a leading exporter of black tea, accounting for nearly 20 per cent of total global exports.Rating: TrueBasis: The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations reports that Kenya is the leading exporter of black tea in the world. Kenya is followed by Sri Lanka, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania respectively. In the report, FAO projects that from 2013 through to 2023, black tea production will minimally grow at 2.9% annually with major exporting countries like Kenya expected to sustain the upward trend.Kenya Tea Development Agency further confirms that Kenya is the world’s largest exporter of black teas. It also ranks the country as the third-largest producer of black teas globally after China and India, accounting for 25% of total global tea exports in 2013.FAO further projects growth of black tea in Africa to be weak until 2027, but Kenya will still maintain its position as the leading exporter on the continent and the world, with an average growth of 2.9 per cent.Data from the World Bank shows that Kenya’s black tea export in 2014/2015, accounted for 22% of total global exports. The data further indicates that Kenya is the third leading producer of black tea.Data from FAO, World Bank and KTDA point to Kenya as a leading exporter and producer of black tea, with its increased output contributing to a rise of 3.14 per cent of global black tea production in 2018 over the preceding year. This makes President Kenyatta’s claim True.Claim 2: In 2018, Kenya exported 476 million kilograms of tea, earning Ksh140 billion.Rating: PlausibleBasis: According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, Kenya exported 501.8 million kilograms (501,800 tonnes) of tea in 2018, compared to 467 million kilograms (467,000 tonnes) in 2017, to record a 7.2% rise.Besides, data from Kenya’s Agriculture and Food Authority shows that in 2018 the country exported 474 million kilograms of tea, which is close to President Kenyatta’s claim of 476 million kilograms. In 2019, Kenya sold 496 million kilograms of tea in total to foreign buyers such as Pakistan.Despite the volume of tea exports rising by 7.2%, its value slumped by 5.7% to KSh138.8 billion from KSh147.3 billion the preceding year, according to KNBS. The figure given by President Kenyatta for the value of tea exports in 2018 can be assumed to be based on this, given that the actual value of KSh138.8 billion can be truncated to KSh140 billion. Besides, data from the Agriculture and Food Authority shows tea exports brought in KSh 140.86 billion in earnings in 2018, validating the claim.Kenya’s tea exports and earningsThe table above shows the volume and earnings of tea for Kenya from 2014 to 2018. Data depicted on this table and extracted from the Agriculture and Food Authority make President Kenyatta’s claim that Kenya exported 476 million kilograms of tea Plausible.Claim 3: Sri Lanka, on the other hand, exported 288 million kgs, which is about 60% of our exports. However, they earned an equivalent of Ksh150 billion.Rating: FalseAccording to Sri Lanka Market Review data, the country exported 282 million kilograms of tea — 6 million kilograms less than was claimed by President Kenyatta — to earn the equivalent of KSh140 billion in 2018. The volume of tea exported by Sri Lanka was approximately 56.2 percent of Kenya’s total export, which is not far off from the 60% asserted by President Kenyatta.Data from the Sri Lanka Market Review shows that in 2017, the Asian country sold 288 million kilograms of tea to fetch the equivalent of KSh150 billion. Given that President Kenyatta was comparing Kenya’s tea earnings to Sri Lanka’s for the year 2018, it is inaccurate to use the country’s 2017 data. Hence, President Kenyatta’s claim is False.Going by the data provided above, Sri Lanka seemingly commits to value addition for its tea more than Kenya. Kenya exports more volume of tea, while Sri Lanka exports less, but earns more. This validates Kenyatta’s emphasis on the need to add value to Kenya’s tea for it to attract better earnings in foreign markets. According to the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, if Kenyan tea is sold in value-added form, the country is likely to earn 500% more than it earns today from selling tea in raw form.",FactFact-checking

He is scheduled to leave office in 2021 upon reaching the age of 70 as stipulated by the Constitution. The letter cites the example of Maraga’s predecessor, Dr Willy Mutunga, who retired a year early in 2016.The post with the fake letter comes at a time when the chief justice is embroiled in a tug of war with the office of the president. On June 8, CJ Maraga accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of undermining the rule of law and disobeying court orders after the head of state failed to formally appoint 41 judges as recommended by the Judicial Service Commission in August 2019.However, the Judiciary has distanced itself from the notice, posting notifications on its official Facebook and Twitter accounts that the letter is not authentic.The letter appears to be a fabricated copy of an authentic letter sent by the Government of Malawi announcing that Chief Justice Andrew Nyirenda had been sent on forced leave with immediate effect, pending his retirement.

The payment service, named WhatsApp Pay, allows users to send money to one another free of charge or make purchases without leaving the chat platform. It is only available to the public in Brazil at the moment.The company explains that consumers can set up an account from which to transact by providing their name and social security number, which must be linked to a Visa or Mastercard offered by three local banks in Brazil — Sicredi, Banco do Brasil and NubankThe statement from WhatsApp adds that the company plans to make the service more widely available in future, and that other financial institutions will be allowed to join the platform to provide their clients with the ability to transact via WhatsApp.Facebook, which acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, has started to roll out Facebook Pay, a similar service, on its main platform. In May 2020, the company also launched Facebook Shops to allow sellers to create digital storefronts on Facebook or Instagram.WhatsApp says it will facilitate free peer-to-peer payments for users, noting that the system will integrate with Facebook Pay so that users’ card information is saved across both services.The Brazil launch follows Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s comment in January this year that the company will prioritize the introduction of the feature in four countries — Brazil, India, Mexico, and Indonesia.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that WhatsApp has launched a digital payment service to all its users and finds the HEADLINE to be FALSE.",FALSE
396,Kenya’s current external debt over Ksh6.2 trillion?,"A Facebook post by Fred Tsomie, published on January 14, said that Kenya’s external debt stood at over Ksh6.2 trillion.The post suggests that the country faces a major slowdown in economic growth and singles out public debt as a key concern.As the government continues to borrow from both local and international lenders to finance infrastructure projects, there are fears that increasing public debt is pulling the country towards the possibility of a debt crisis and that the government will be unable to repay what it owes.So, the question is: how much external debt does the government of Kenya currently carry?PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Kenya’s current external debt is Ksh6.2 trillion and found it to be FALSE, based on the following:According to the 2020 African Economic Outlook Report, Kenya’s public debt rose from 41 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 to 58 per cent of GDP in 2019. About 67 per cent of this is non-concessional while 33 per cent is concessional debt. More of the country’s debt stock is held externally (16% of GDP) than domestically (9% of GDP). The debt creates risks for refinancing, cost escalation, and foreign exchange.In view of expected liquidity challenges, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) elevated Kenya’s risk of debt distress from low to moderate in October 2018 after the country’s debt hit the 5 trillion shilling mark in May 2018.In November 2019, the Senate approved the National Treasury’s request to review the country’s debt ceiling to an absolute figure of Ksh9 trillion. For the current 2019/20 financial year, the treasury budgeted Ksh 572.9 billion as total debt repayment for both principal and interest. In 2018/19 Ksh 642 billion was used to repay debt.Kenya’s external public debt stock increased by USD5.5 billion from USD 24.5 billion in September 2018 to USD30 billion by the end of September 2019. The increase is attributed to a rise in external disbursements made during the period. The debt stock comprised 34.3 per cent, 32.9 per cent, 32.2 per cent, and 0.6 per cent of debt owed to commercial banks, multilateral institutions, bilaterals, and suppliers’ credit, respectively.The National Treasury’s most recent report placed public debt at Ksh6.05 trillion by December 2019. Treasury’s February 2020 policy paper on government borrowing gave a similar figure of Ksh6.01 trillion for the country’s total public debt, including Ksh2.9 trillion external debt by December 2019.According to the Quarterly Economic and Budget Review report released in February 2020, Kenya’s public debt stock stood at Ksh6.05 trillion as of December 31, 2019, comprising of the domestic debt at Ksh 2.94 trillion (48.6 per cent), while Ksh 3.11 trillion owed to external creditors, representing 51.4 per cent of the country’s total debt obligations.Data from the Central Bank of Kenya supports the National Treasury data, which shows that the government’s combined external and domestic debt stood at Ksh1.9 trillion in May 2013, rising to Ksh6.05 trillion in December 2019. This includes domestic debt of Ksh2.94 trillion and external debt of Ksh3.106 trillion.While each measure of debt is useful in understanding the country’s fiscal condition, it is clear that the country bears a loan burden that is already high, with several entities including credit rating agencies, the IMF and the World Bank raising concerns over the country’s rising debt.A third of the Ksh3 trillion external debt is owed to private creditors, including holders of the country’s two Euro-bonds. It is the first time in the current financial year that external debt has increased by a bigger margin than domestic debt in line with National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani’s policy to move away from expensive commercial loans.From the data above, it’s clear that the current external debt stands at about Ksh3 trillion, which makes the claim by Mr Fred Tsomie that Kenya’s external debt is currently over Ksh6.2 trillion FALSE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

It also gave notice of the party’s intention to replace Mr Chris Mandu with Ms Josephine Maungu in the role of national organising secretary.The gazette notice, which followed a tussle over party leadership resulting in claims of Wetangula and Mandu’s ouster, also called upon those with objections to the changes to write to the registrar.Mr Wetangula filed a petition before the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal (PPDT), a panel established to speedily adjudicate political party disputes, to challenge his ouster.The post has a link to an article stating that Mr Wetangula is no longer interested in pursuing the petition following the purported withdrawal of the gazette notice.However, the claim appears to be a misreading of the decision by the PPDT issued on June 12, which ordered the withdrawal of the petition by Mr Wetangula. It did not direct the recall of the gazette notice as alleged.The Registrar of Political Parties issued a statement on June 12, dismissing reports that the gazette notice had been withdrawn as misleading.“The correct position as advanced by the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal (PPDT) on Friday, June 12th, 2020, is that the gazette notice still stands,” read the statement in part.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Registrar of Political Parties has withdrawn the gazette notice on FORD-Kenya leadership changes and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The poll measured public perception in Kenya about the COVID -19 pandemic.While it is true that the top three issues of concern that respondents to the poll wanted the government to address were COVID -19, food insecurity and unemployment, the poll did not indicate that 99% of Kenyans are opposed to the BBI changes to the constitution as claimed in the post.Rather, only one per cent of the respondents to the poll rank constitutional reforms as a key issue of concern that they want the government to addressThe BBI process, an initiative of President Kenyatta and Raila Odinga, aims to address issues that Kenya has dealt with since independence by making institutional and constitutional reforms. A key component of the initiative is the proposal for constitutional reforms geared towards ending the repeated cycles of violence associated with general elections.While the issue has animated public debate over the recent past, Mr. Walter Nyabundi, a research manager at Infotrak Research & Consulting, clarified that constitutional reform in the context of the poll in question could have referred to anything.“Nowhere did we talk about the BBI. To that extent, reports that only one per cent supported BBI is completely untrue,” Mr Nyabundi told PesaCheck on the phone.Infotrak chief executive Angela Ambitho added that from a research perspective, a BBI poll would require an accurate question on the same. “We did a COVID-19 poll, not a BBI poll,” she told PesaCheck in a phone interview.Additionally, the poll does not show that 11 percent of Kenyans support the measures taken by President Uhuru Kenyatta to curb the spread of COVID -19 as claimed by the post. Instead, 62 percent of respondents think that the president is doing a good job in dealing with COVID-19.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Infotrak released a poll showing that only one percent of Kenyans support the Building Bridges Initiative referendum, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
410,President Magufuli urged Tanzanians to hike the price of food sold to Kenya,"A tweet claiming that President John Magufuli urged Tanzanians to hike the prices of foodstuff when selling to Kenya is TRUE.The claim, which was repeated on Kenyan News and ViuSasa News, stated that President Magufuli instructed Tanzanians to overprice foodstuffs destined for Kenyan markets.Speaking at a function where he hosted his predecessors Benjamin Mkapa, Hassan Mwinyi, Jakaya Kikwete, and former first lady Mama Maria Nyerere, Magufuli urged farmers to hold onto their farm produce and sell it when they must.According to the president, neighboring countries that imposed a lockdown will eventually experience food shortages while Tanzanians are expecting a bumper harvest. He urged the business community to take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic and hike prices when selling their farm produce to countries currently in lockdown.Tanzania is among the few countries that did not impose any restrictions on movement to curb the spread of COVID-19, unlike her neighbouring countries. Kenya went into lockdown in early March, shutting down markets and non-essential businesses in urban centers.Uganda followed in mid-March, shutting down all businesses, closing borders and schools, while Rwanda closed all its borders, allowing only the movement of goods and cargo and returning citizens from March 23.In May, Zambia closed her border with Tanzania to curb the spread of COVID-19 and Kenya closed her borders with both Tanzania and Somalia as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections linked to cross-border movement continued to rise. However, goods and cargo trucks remain exempt.Kenya imports cereals, beverages, spirits, and vinegar from Tanzania while exporting plastics, animal and vegetable fats, electrical equipment, and vehicles among others.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that President John Magufuli urged Tanzanians to hike prices on foodstuffs when selling them to Kenya and finds it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:
411,Total Kenya is not giving out free gas cylinders,"A website claiming that Total Kenya is giving out free gas cylinders to Kenyans is a SCAM.According to the website, Kenyan citizens aged over 18 years can book a free 6kg or 13kg cylinder filled with gas by making an application on the website and paying a delivery fee to an M-Pesa number.Applicants are required to send Ksh200 for a 6kg cylinder and Ksh270 for a 13kg one to a number registered to a Dr Simon Ngotho, the purported head of finance and procurement.PesaCheck has previously debunked similar hoaxes, and this is another classic example of an online scam targeting gullible Kenyans.There is no mention of such a promotion on Total Kenya’s website, official Facebook and Twitter accounts.A WhoIs search shows the misleading online page was registered on May 30, 2020 while the official Total Kenya website was registered on February 12, 2003.Mr David Ayilo, Total Kenya’s corporate affairs manager, told PesaCheck via email that the company is not offering free gas cylinders and that the website claiming to advertise the gas cylinders is not legitimate.He added that Total gases are ordinarily purchased from a service station or an authorized dealer.Mr Richard Mmbaka, a manager at Total Kenya, also told PesaCheck in a phone interview that there is no one by the name Simon Ngotho working at Total.PesaCheck has looked into a website claiming to advertise free gas cylinders from Total Kenya and finds it to be a HOAX.",FALSE:

The amount was to be deposited through M-Pesa PayBill number 880100 or NCBA Bank Kenya, account number 7989690026.Applicants were asked to submit tender reference numbers, company names, contact addresses and phone numbers, alongside the name of the contact person and mobile money transaction reference number once they had paid.The scammers also acquired a fake email name which sounds close to the actual Gates Foundation emails to boost credibility.On Tuesday, June 2, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation published a statement on its website, warning the public not to fall for the fake tender notice.The foundation said it does not have a regional office in Nairobi as indicated in the fake tender notice. Their Africa office is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and they also have representatives based in Johannesburg, South Africa and Abuja, Nigeria who oversee initiatives in those countries.A notice on their website reads: “We are aware of a potential scam involving a foundation office in Nairobi, Kenya.

414,Screengrab of a tweet showing President Trump ordered a missile strike on Alex Ndiritu is fabricated,"A Facebook post with a screengrab of a tweet supposedly from the handle of President Donald Trump ordering a missile strike on one Alex Ndiritu is FALSE.The screengrab was shared alongside a text urging Mr Ndiritu to go into hiding.Mr Ndiritu, a Kenyan whose Facebook profile says he’s based in Nyeri, became the subject of news coverage after calling for the burning of the White House amidst protests in the US over the death of George Floyd.The screenshot of Mr Ndiritu’s comment was widely shared, prompting online users to express concern over his motive.However, President Trump, who has routinely expressed his views over the ongoing protests on Twitter, has neither responded to Mr Ndiritu’s comments nor mentioned him in any of his tweets.While the time stamp on the screengrab of the fictitious tweet shows Mr Trump shared it on May 29, 2020, at 11:41 a.m, the US president’s Twitter account reveals no activity between 7.53 am — when he asked Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to bring order to the city rocked by protests — and 2:10 p.m.Trump later accused Twitter of unfairly targeting him when the social media company flagged his previous tweet.In the days after the fabricated tweet claimed he would be “smoked out” on May 29, Ndiritu was still doing media interviews — first with KTN News on May 30 and later with NTV on June 2. In both interviews, he did not indicate that he was on the run as a result of the alleged drone operation, although he expressed concerns about his safety as a result of his comment.The US has previously used drones, otherwise known as unmanned aerial vehicles to target wanted criminals such as terrorists in areas considered too risky to deploy manned aircraft.

415,This video purporting to show President Kenyatta drunk during an interview has been doctored,"A Facebook post with a video claiming to show President Uhuru Kenyatta sloppy in his speech and suggesting he was in a drunken stupor is FALSE.The video bears the branding of NTV, a local television channel, and shows President Kenyatta slurring his words.Slurred speech is stereotypically used to indicate drunkenness. However, while it is true that it may be the result of a high level of alcohol in the bloodstream, significantly affecting one’s ability to speak, it can also be caused by dysarthria, a medical condition caused by nervous system disorders that weaken the muscles used for speech.However, this appears not to be the case as an internet search reveals that the video in question is doctored and was originally taken from a recorded interview which the president gave to NTV. The same segment was broadcast on May 31 and uploaded online.While the doctored video is one-minute long, the original version only runs for 30 seconds, indicating that it has been digitally manipulated by employing slow-motion effects available on video editing software, mobile applications and electronic devices.PesaCheck has looked into a video that claims to show President Uhuru Kenyatta sloppy in his speech and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
416,Uhuru’s Executive Order didn’t downgrade office of the deputy president and control of staff,"A Facebook post claiming that President Uhuru Kenyatta used an Executive Order to take away the deputy president’s powers to hire and fire his staff is FALSE.The post adds that the president collapsed the DP’s office and placed it under the Office of the President.On June 4, President Kenyatta issued Executive Order №1 of 2020 that makes changes within the structure of the Kenya government, including changing the name of the office of the president from The Presidency to the Executive Office of the President.In the reorganized structure, the National Development Implementation and Communication Committee, headed by Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, is not listed as one of the functions of the Ministry of Interior. Instead, a new role of Oversight and Coordination in the Delivery of National Priorities and Flagship Programmes has been created.The Public Service Commission Act stipulates that it is the responsibility of the PSC to recruit, select, appoint, promote, and deploy government staff, including those who work in the office of the DP.The PSC is responsible for hiring staff at the office of the deputy president and the DP has no authority in this respect, contrary to the claim made in the post.The DP continues to be the principal assistant to the president and deputizes for him in the execution of his functions. The powers that are given to the person holding that office come from the constitution. That has not changed.What is new is that the Executive Order recognizes the Nairobi Metropolitan Services as a public office and places it under the Executive Office of the President.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that President Uhuru Kenyatta has downgraded the office of the deputy president and taken away its hiring and firing powers and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

418,Kenya’s COVID-19 economic stimulus package cushion the informal sector?,"President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a series of measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including policy directives and regulations for public behaviour, all aimed at limiting the spread of the disease.In a public address on March 25, the president directed government departments and private companies to allow employees to work from home and asked citizens to restrict their movements as he introduced a dusk to dawn curfew.The president also introduced interventions to cushion the public against the economic effects of the pandemic. The COVID-19 stimulus package includes a 100% tax relief for individuals earning up to Ksh 28,000, a reduction in Pay As You Earn (PAYE) from 30% to 25%, temporary suspension of listing of those with bad credit, reduction of value-added tax (VAT) from 16% to 14% and reduced turnover tax rate for small to mid-size enterprises (3%-1%).Therefore the question is, will the government’s COVID-19 economic stimulus package cushion the informal sector?PesaCheck looked into how COVID-19 economic stimulus package will cushion the informal sector and found the following.Small and informal businesses make up the majority of business enterprises in Kenya, accounting for 83.6% of all employment, and engaging over 17.8 million people. Formal employment accounted for just over 2.7 million jobs in 2018, including 842,900 people employed by the public sector, according to data from Kenya’s Economic Survey 2019.Data from one year earlier puts employment in the formal sector at 2.6 million waged employees, of whom 1.22 million earn less than Ksh30,000 per month. About 451,158 — or 37% of this group — are women.The newly signed tax law introduced a 100% PAYE tax relief for people earning less than Ksh 28,000 per month. Over 1.2 million employees in the formal sector earn between 0 to 29,999 (Ksh) according to the 2018 Kenya National Bureau of Statistics report and the new Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020 will affect many of them.The informal sector accounts for about 34.3% of Kenya’s GDP, according to an Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA) 2012 report. Despite its significant role, taxation of the informal sector has been difficult to enforce. IEA found that 83% of businesses in the informal sector do not regularly contribute to government revenue through tax and a majority are not registered with the Kenya Revenue Authority, and generally not compliant with tax regulations.There are no accurate statistics on monthly income for employees in the informal sector. A survey by the Aga Khan University (2019), found that 81% of those employed in the sector earn between Ksh5,000 and Ksh25,000 each month.The president’s directive that turnover tax rate be reduced from 3% to 1% for businesses not exceeding Ksh5 million per annum is designed to support the estimated 2.5 million SMEs who fall in this bracket. The reduction will provide some relief for this large number of small businesses which are most vulnerable to the economic downturn triggered by the pandemic.Almost two-thirds of informal enterprises find it difficult to access financial services, according to a 2016 study by the World Bank. The report shows that 86.8% of informal businesses use funds from personal sources to finance day-to-day operations. Fewer than one out of every 10 use banks. In 2015, the Central Bank of Kenya estimated the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) lending portfolio held by banks to be Ksh 332 billion, representing 23.4% of their total loan portfolio.More informal businesses rely on credit from digital platforms. A Strathmore University report assessed uptake of loans from digital platforms at 45%, highlighting the potential of these platforms to serve as a vehicle for financing growth of informal businesses.Specific data on loan performance for informal businesses is not readily available. However, the widespread negative listing by credit reference bureaus (CRB) points to the difficulty many borrowers have in repaying loans. In early 2019 news reports showed 2.7 million digital borrowers in Kenya had been blacklisted by CRBs and the number increased to 3.2 million by April 2020. Over 300,000 customers were listed by banking institutions by the end of 2017.Going by the above data, the temporary suspension of CRB listing will offer financial relief to over 3 million customers — in both informal and formal business sectors — and enable them to renegotiate debt repayment or access credit facilities from banks and financial institutions despite being blacklistedThe reduction of the VAT standard rate from 16% to 14% will make taxable goods and services more affordable and is expected to lower the cost of doing business for most entities. It will also improve the cash flow of businesses due to reduced outflow and reduced credits/refunds. The consumer will benefit economically in the form of reduced prices.The benefits accruing from the stimulus package will be tempered by several factors. The 7 pm to 5 am curfew means many businesses are restricted in their working hours, and will lose money unless the situation returns to what it was. Employees in the informal sector who depend on day-to-day or hour-to-hour wages will lose a significant percentage of their earnings.Businesses in the informal sector will also be affected as many will end up with a reduction in customers because of the pandemic. The government’s stay-at-home orders will also have negative consequences for spending in shopping malls, markets, and restaurants many of which have been ordered to close indefinitely. For the outlets that remain open, the walk-in traffic has reduced as a result of containment and social distancing measures put in place.In conclusion, based on the tax and related measures put in place by the government to cushion the economy against the COVID-19 pandemic, over 1 million workers in the formal sector will get the 100% tax relief while another 1 million people in the sector will feel the 25% PAYE reduction relief.Both businesses and consumers will benefit from the VAT rate reduction and the turnover tax reduction will assist small and medium traders, whose businesses are likely to be hardest hit by the economic downturn.However, given the significant economic downturn expected from the aftermath of COVID-19, many employees working for informal businesses will lose their jobs and income, while the entities will end up making losses in the short to medium term despite the government measures.",Will

Police beat up peaceful black civil rights demonstrators as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma and marched on to a highway on March 7, 1965, in what came to be known as ‘Bloody Sunday.’Mr Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died on May 25 while in police custody, after he was arrested by Minneapolis officers on suspicion of buying cigarettes with counterfeit money.In a video that has gone viral, former police officer Derek Chauvin is seen pinning Floyd to the ground with his knee on the suspect’s neck. Floyd died after complaining he couldn’t breathe. His death has sparked outrage in major US cities and some parts of the world, with protesters calling for an end to police violence against black citizens.Derek has since been charged with second-degree murder while three other officers who were at the scene during the killing have also been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.On June 3, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar confirmed the charges on Twitter, saying that the latest charges were an important step for justice.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post with a photo claiming to show President Obama and his family participating in a protest and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:

421,does the transfer of Nairobi County functions to the national government mean?,"Since the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution of Kenya (CoK, 2010), the country has reconfigured the balance of power by devolving power and responsibilities from the national government to 47 elected county governments. The adoption was a desire of citizens who wanted access to public services closer to them.This reconfiguration aimed at devolving power, resources, and providing for representation down to the local level as provided for under Articles 174 and 175 of the CoK, 2010. The devolved system of government has been implemented since March 2013, after the first general election under the new constitution.The national government comprises the executive, parliament, and the judiciary while the county government is made up of the executive and county assembly. These two levels of governments are distinct and interdependent and conduct their affairs on the basis of consultation and cooperation. The two derive their main functions, mandates, and roles from the Fourth Schedule of the constitution.Under the Fourth Schedule, the main role of the national government is to regulate and coordinate national economic planning through policy formulation and monitoring as well as being in charge of the country’s security, military, courts and in several delivery areas, such as the processing and issuance of passports, national identity cards and birth certificates.The national government is also responsible for direct delivery of basic services especially in marginalized areas, through the allocation of national revenue and resources such as conditional or unconditional grant and equitable funds.The county governments receive a significant portion of public finances and service delivery. The counties receive at least 15 percent of all revenues raised at the national level as a way to support devolution. The county government ensures and coordinates functions and services at the local level. The county assemblies make laws necessary for the effective performance of county governments and exercise oversight to county executive organs.During the first seven years of the devolution system implementation, a number of key successes has been achieved. Key among them has been the enactment of devolution laws, operationalization of county government structures, and the transfer of functions and allocation of resources to county governments. The expansionary fiscal policy has increased opportunities for growth. The counties are now allocated one-fifth of the total expenditure, which is equivalent to 4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).Laws enacted prior to the promulgation of the 2010 constitution created a number of institutions whose functions are now devolved under the Fourth Schedule of the constitution. This has led to a conflict of laws and between the two levels of government and duplication of roles. However, various laws are being enacted by parliament to create frameworks on which devolution can be fully achieved.The devolved system of government has experienced its own number of challenges, mainly attributed to factors such as rising public debt and spending pressure as a result of devolution, national security, flagship infrastructure projects, and an increasing public wage bill.There have also been institutional, intergovernmental, and resource-related challenges such as human resources management, disagreement of the two levels of government over resource allocation, and conflicts between various stakeholders involved in the implementation of the devolved system of government.Nairobi has experienced its fair share of challenges, which have led to major shortfalls in service delivery and revenue collection. The most apparent of these are mismanagement and misappropriation of county funds, rampant corruption, and cartels which have hijacked important functions. The county has also seen declines in revenue collection, attributed to political turmoil and loopholes in the collection system.In November 2017, the national government established the Nairobi Regeneration Programme — a delivery unit to coordinate service delivery jointly with the Nairobi county government. The unit’s mandate was to focus on key economic and social sectors, including urban renewal, waste management, water & sewer, and decongestion. However, the program failed to deliver on its mandate because of lacking a legal framework, political goodwill as well as constant reshuffling of county staffNairobi County is a diplomatic, business and a major financial center. The city is headquarters to many of the multinational companies, organizations, missions, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON), investment banks, and insurance companies.It is also the hub for the country’s telecommunications, electronic, broadcasting, and publishing industries. With a population of 4,397,073 as per the 2019 census, it has an estimated share of national GDP of 21.7% (2013–2017) followed by Nakuru (6.1%), Kiambu (5.5%) and Mombasa (4.7%). In the 2018/19 financial year, Nairobi was allocated 16.9 billion as equitable share while in the same year, the county raised Ksh10.25 billion as its own revenue.The county also hosts the Office of the President and other key government institutions and installations. Being a major commercial hub in the country, the county requires a seamless delivery of services and facilitation from the national government to ensure service delivery to its residence.Article 187 allows functions or power transfer from one level of government to another if the other party will perform it more effectively. In February, Nairobi Governor Mike Mbuvi ‘Sonko’ signed an agreement to hand over some functions of the Nairobi County government to the national government.The move was attributed to the county’s failure to run its services that had ground to a halt. At the time, Governor Sonko was battling court cases over misappropriation and unlawful acquisition of property and was as a result barred from accessing his county offices until the case was determined.Following the agreement signing, President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the Nairobi Metropolitan Service (NMS) — a new state agency that will be in charge of the functions handed over to the national government by the county government. The president also appointed Major General Mohamed Badi and Enosh Onyango Momanyi as director-general and deputy director-general of the new state agency respectively.Under the revised Executive Order №1 of 2020 issued in January, the Nairobi Metropolitan Service will be under the Office of the President. The Executive Order highlights changes made in the restructuring of the Office of the President. This implies that the handover functions to the national government will now be under the direct supervision of the President.Nairobi County has 10 major sectors, which include finance and economic planning; devolution and public service; environment, water and sanitation; roads, transport, and infrastructure; ICT and e-government; and education; sports, youth, and social services. The others are trading, tourism, health services, land, housing, and urban planning and agriculture, and livestock.With the new arrangement, the NMS will be in charge of health, transport, public works, and planning & development services. The county government will be in charge of the remaining functions as listed in Article 187 of the Constitution.The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) under Gazette Notice №1609, of February 25, was designated as the principal-agent for overall revenue collection in Nairobi County. This means KRA would get full access to the city revenue processes, information, data, and systems. Relevant resources for the implementation of the agreement are to be seconded from the county to the national government.Prior to NMS, the county government had been collecting revenue in partnership with JamboPay and National Bank. The county had engaged JamboPay to digitize its revenue collection systems in a bid to efficiently manage its income sources. However, the county cut ties with the service provider following the expiry of the agreed term in mid-2019 and opted for its internal revenue collection system through a partnership with National Bank.Nairobi County’s revenues have been largely flat, as evidenced in the table above. The county has not been able to reach its allocated revenue target in all its six financial years. In FY 2018/19, the county collected 66.17% of its allocated target of KSh15.49 billion. The closest the county has gotten to its target revenue was in 2014/15, the second financial year since the onset of devolution when it collected 86.34% of its target, which was substantially lower than in the previous year.According to the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) report, Nairobi County has a potential of collecting up to KSh77.91 billion, which is equivalent to 485.22% of its average annual target of Ksh16.06 billion for the last six financial years. Going by the CRA projections, the county has achieved about 13% of its full potential. The slow growth in revenue is largely blamed on the county’s underperformance in collections from land and housing rates due to outdated valuation.With the ‘hand over’, the NMS team is expected to bring an end to corruption and dismantle the cartels that have hindered the city’s development while working on streamlining urban renewal projects. Additionally, the team is also expected to help improve traffic management and in decongesting the city center, garbage collection and disposal methods, streamline development control and approvals for the county as well as implementing various master plans, such the Nairobi Railway Master plan, Eastlands Urban Renewal Master plan, and Nairobi Urban Mobility Plan.",What
422,Reports that SportPesa is returning to Kenya in June are untrue,"An article claiming that betting firm SportPesa has announced its return to Kenya in June is FALSE.The article was published on May 30 on the Kenyan Times website, and states that the betting company would resume its operations in Kenya on June 17, 2020. The post says that the re-entry of SportPesa into the market follows an announcement by its chief executive, Ronald Karauri, that they had resolved restrictions on its operations with the Kenya Revenue Authority, allowing its comeback.However, in response to a tweet inquiring whether SportPesa was indeed returning to Kenya, Mr Karauri termed the news as fake.Through its official Twitter handle, SportPesa also responded to enquiries from the public and noted that there is no specific timeline for the resumption of its Kenya operations, saying they are still waiting for a new licence from the Betting Control and Licensing Board.The government revoked SportPesa’s licence in July, 2019, stating that the betting firm had failed to meet its tax obligations. The company was one of 20 betting companies affected by new provisions of The Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Regulations, 2019.On September 3, 2019, the firm announced that it had been cleared by KRA, adding they were confident the process to allow the resumption of its activities would be finalised speedily.

423,The Government of Kenya has not partnered with USAID to issue grants to entrepreneurs,"A Facebook post claiming that the Kenya government has partnered with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and other international organizations to issue grants to Kenyan businesses is FAKE.The post, published on May 28 on a Facebook page impersonating Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, asks entrepreneurs to submit applications for the ‘grants’ to boost their businesses, through a website link.Aside from USAID, an organization identified only by the initials BACC is also mentioned among partners involved in the project.The website states that the grants are under a programme dubbed the “Drip Fund,” which also appeared on a fake advertisement for funding opportunities from USAID. The ad used the same methods, where applicants were directed to a website and asked to fill a form.The website on this new post further claims that the fund has supported more than 700 projects in the country, and aims to create over 10,000 jobs for women and youth. According to the site, another USD1.9 million has been allocated to support SMEs, with USD1 million earmarked to boost small scale farmers.However, PesaCheck found no trace of the Drip Fund on USAID’s website or on its Facebook and Twitter accounts.An aide to CS Munya told PesaCheck that the project is fake, and that the cabinet secretary is not involved in it in any way.Ms Kimberly Case, USAID’s senior regional development outreach and communications officer, also told PesaCheck that the Drip Fund project was fake.A Google search of BACC does not show results of an organization with the name.Facebook Page Transparency on the page impersonating CS Munya shows that it was created on May 28, 2020, the same day the misleading post was published.A WhoIs search of the website that potential applicants are linked to via the Facebook post shows that it was registered on May 28, the same day the fake Facebook page was created and the post published.

424,Kakamega County allocate 30 percent of its budget to health?,"According to Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, his county allocates almost a third of its total budget to health.The governor made this claim in a documentary on the state of health services in the county on January 29.In the documentary, Oparanya points to key achievements of his administration including the ongoing construction of the Kakamega Teaching and Referral Hospital that will target more than five million people. When complete, the hospital will have a 750-bed capacity, 28 ICU beds, and multiple wings, he says. Phase one is expected to be operational before the end of 2020.So, the question is, does the county government of Kakamega allocate about 30 percent of its entire budget to health?Pesacheck has examined the claim and finds it to be TRUE.The Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) has the constitutional role of making recommendations on the financial management of county governments. Informed by the primary objectives underpinning devolution and the goal of bringing services closer to people, the commission recommends that county governments spend at least 17% of their total budgets on health services.In the financial year 2019/20, Kakamega County approved a total budget of about KSh14.9 billion, with KSh 4.5 billion earmarked for the health service department. This translates to 30 percent of the approved budget, whose financial year ends on June 30, 2020. It is not yet clear if the county government will spend the entire approved budget by the end of this financial year.However, looking at the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the county’s final recurrent and development budget was KSh14.48 billion, against the estimated budget of KSh14.50 billion. From the estimated budget, KSh 4.37 billion was allocated to health, translating to 30%. However, unaudited budget data shows that only KSh1.84 billion was spent on health programs. This equates to 12% of the county’s final expenditure going to health — far below the recommended minimum of 17% and less than half of what was allocated.Similarly, a review report by the Controller of Budget for the year 2017/18 found that the Kakamega County health services department was allocated KSh1.022 billion in development expenditure and KSh320.84 million in recurrent expenditure against the budgeted KSh3.96 billion (30% of the actual expenditure of KSh 12.9 billion; actual expenditure on health was KSh 1.34 billion, or just 10% of Ksh12.9 billion).County budget data shows that the allocation to health services has grown progressively over five years. Budget estimates for 2016/17 were KSh13.2 billion, with KSh 3.49 billion allocated to health. In the preceding financial year, the county had a budget estimate of KSh12.32 billion, and allocated KSh3.17 billion to health.Since 2017, the county has consistently allocated about 30% of its budget to health services. However, expenditure on health services remains below the 17 percent recommended by the CRA.Governor Oparanya’s claim that the county of Kakamega allocates about 30 percent of its entire budget on health is therefore factually TRUE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

425,Tanzania’s High Commissioner to Kenya was not withdrawn over a border dispute,"A website article claiming that Tanzania’s High Commissioner to Kenya, Dr. Pindi Chana, was withdrawn from her post over border disputes between the two countries is FALSE.The article suggests that Dr Chana’s removal from her posting was linked to COVID-19 testing at the Kenya-Tanzania border, and Kenya’s decision to close the border to all traffic except for cargo led to a retaliation by Tanzania to limit the entry of drivers from Kenya.The article appears to be a translation of one that had been published by The Citizen newspaper, which was later withdrawn after Tanzania’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation published a statement indicating that Dr Chana had completed her term, and the claims that there were ‘questions’ over her replacement were false.The Citizen’s published an apology over the article, stating that the paper’s reporting did not in any way aim to connect Dr Chana’s recalling with tensions at the border over testing of truck drivers for COVID-19, but rather, was linked to the fact that there had not been any indication of Dr Chana’s status following the swearing in of Dr. John Simbachawene, Tanzania’s Ambassador-designate to Kenya on May 21.The letter from the Foreign Ministry stated that Dr Chana’s removal was not because of the border dispute with Kenya over COVID-19, adding that her contract ended in December 2019 and that proper procedures were followed in appointing a replacement.The apology by The Citizen acknowledged that Dr. Chana tour duty ended in December last year, about six months before the border dispute.While The Citizen published and withdrew their story on Dr Chana, Africazilla, the website where the article had been republished, did not take their version down. The article was still available online at the time this fact-check was published.Dr. Chana served in Kenya from February 2017 to December 2019. She was also accredited to South Sudan, Seychelles, Somalia, Eritrea, UNEP and UN-Habitat.On 21 May 2020, Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli presided over the swearing in of Dr. John Simbachawene, who was succeeding Dr. Chana.PesaCheck has investigated a website article claiming that the removal of Tanzanian High Commissioner to Kenya Dr. Pindi Chana was due to the border dispute over COVID-19 testing and finds to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The four co-chairs make up the Governance and Leadership Sub-committee.Canada and Italy were also elected to the Steering Committee according to the announcement made on May 29 by the OGP. The governments of the three countries elected to the Steering Committee will start their terms on October 1, alongside three new civil society leaders who are expected to be selected by the Open Government community in the coming weeks.Founded in 2011, the Open Government Partnership is a multilateral and multi-stakeholder initiative comprising government leaders and civil society advocates in 78 countries whose goal is to promote accountable and inclusive governance.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that DP Ruto has been elected to represent Kenya and the continent in the Steering Committee of the Open Government Partnership, and finds it to be PARTLY FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",PARTLY
427,malaria prevalence in Kenya declined over the last 10 years?,"On April 25, 2020, during celebrations to mark World Malaria day, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Kenya is stepping up efforts to reduce malaria prevalence.He made a claim that the country has significantly lowered malaria prevalence from 6 million infections to 4.6 million over the last 10 years, and he attributed the progress to support and cooperation between the government, development partners, and health providers.President Kenyatta, who is also the chairperson of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA), said malaria has ravaged communities for decades and is considered to be largely an African problem with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for 93 per cent of global malaria cases.During the address, the president called on African heads of state and other stakeholders to come together to mobilize resources and proactively implement programs with the ultimate goal of wiping out the disease by the year 2030.So, the question is, has malaria prevalence in Kenya reduced from 6 million in 2009 to 4.6 million in 2020?PesaCheck has looked into the claim and finds the following;The President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), a US government initiative to control and eliminate malaria, reports that malaria transmission and infection risk in Kenya are determined largely by altitude, rainfall patterns, and temperature, which leads to considerable variation in malaria prevalence by season and across geographic regions.According to PMI, approximately 70 percent of Kenya’s population is at risk for malaria, with 14 million people in endemic areas, and another 17 million in areas likely to experience epidemic and seasonal malaria.In Kenya, the highest number of malaria deaths occurs in children under the age of five. Data from the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network shows that approximately 63.5% of malaria deaths in the country occurred in under-fives.According to the World Malaria Report released by the WHO in December 2019, there were 228 million cases of malaria in 2018 compared to 231 million in 2017. The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 405 000 in 2018, compared to 416 000 deaths in 2017.Claim 1: Malaria prevalence was at 6 million infections in 2010?Verdict: PlausibleAccording to WHO data, in 2010 there were 6,071,583 reported cases of malaria in Kenya that were presumed and those confirmed by testing were 898,531, which leads to an estimate of 6.8 million.The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in its 2014 Economic Survey shows that reported cases of malaria in 2010 were 11,371,884 and 9,833,701 in 2009. The data does not state how the cases were confirmed.The president’s claim that Kenya’s prevalence in terms of the number of infections is, however, supported by the WHO data, which has an estimate of 6 million as the number of confirmed cases.The data above does not fully support the claim by President Uhuru Kenyatta that the malaria infection in Kenya was 6 million, given the ranges in estimates. However, the World Health Organization’s estimate does indicate that there were just over six million likely cases of malaria in 2010, making the president’s claim PLAUSIBLE.Claim 2: Malaria prevalence is at 4.6 million infections currentlyVerdict: FalseAccording to data from the Kenya Bureau of Statistics, as outlined in the Economic Survey 2019, health facilities around the country reported an increase in the incidence of malaria cases from 7,958,213 in 2017 to 10,777,679 in 2018.The 2019 Kenya Malaria Operational Plan shows that the total cases of malaria in 2017 stood at 7,964,281. The 2017 WHO data and Kenya Malaria Operational Plan data all put estimates at around 9 million.The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in its 2019 Economic Survey shows that reported cases of malaria in 2018 were at 10,777,679 and at 7,958,213 for 2017.The Global Health Observatory Data Repository shows the incidence rate of cases per 1000 population of malaria in Kenya increased between 2010 and 2014; it rose from 68 in 2010 to 85 in 2014. However, from 2014 to 2017, the rate of change slowed dramatically, reducing from 85 in 2014 to 70 in 2017.Meanwhile, the World Malaria Report 2019 shows that Kenya had 9,950,781 confirmed cases of malaria in 2018.Taking all the provided data, none supports the claim by President Kenyatta that malaria prevalence has reached a low of 4.6 million. Data available in the public domain shows that Kenya has not significantly lowered malaria prevalence but rather that there has been an increase or stagnation in prevalence rates. Though the president didn’t state the source of his information used to back his claims, the data available does not support a decline in malaria cases.In the past 10 years, Kenya has made strides in preventing and controlling malaria, issuing insecticide-treated bed nets, spraying people’s homes with insecticides, and ensuring that there is widespread diagnostic testing. These efforts have resulted in a significant drop in transmission rates, but progress has not been consistent. Parts of Kenya, especially the counties in the western region and coastal areas, are still plagued by serious seasonal cases of malaria.It is important to note that the data available does not cover 2019 estimates for malarial infections. It may be that this information is on record and has yet to be published in the public arena but is available to government officers and holders of public positions, including the president.Given this limitation, Pesacheck has looked into the claim made by President Uhuru Kenyatta that malaria prevalence in Kenya has fallen to 4.6 million and is unable to determine the data on which his statement is based; in terms of decline in prevalence the provided data doesn’t show a progressive and consistent decline of malaria over the last decade, so the claim is therefore FALSE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

The man, identified as George Floyd, lost consciousness as a result of the police action, and was declared dead on arrival at a nearby hospital.The incident sparked outrage online and protests in the US, but no protests have been reported along the United Nations Avenue in Nairobi where the US Embassy is located.The first photo appears to have a watermark which has been blurred out, and a Google reverse image search did not show when it was originally posted online or the photographer it is credited to.A reverse image search on the second image shows that it was published on VOA News in 2017 alongside an article on protests over the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta.

However, the doctors involved in the study only suggested the use of anticoagulant medications as potentially beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19, and even cautioned that the efficacy of these drugs has not been proved.Additionally, the findings of the autopsy make no mention of COVID-19 being a bacterial disease, and there is no recommendation for the use of antibiotics for its treatment as claimed by the article.Antibiotics are administered to patients with bacterial infections, but scientific evidence shows that COVID-19 is caused the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus,, and has key characteristics of a protective coat of protein and requires a living host, such as a human being, to multiply and spread.Mr Tarik Jašarević, the World Health Organization spokesperson, confirmed to PesaCheck in an email that COVID-19 is caused by a viral infection, which makes antibiotics ineffective against it.Protective measures suggested by the World Health Organization include social distancing and washing hands with soap and water. In the absence of soap and running water, the organization recommends using alcohol-based hand-rub.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Italian doctors confirmed that COVID-19 is a bacterial disease and not a virus, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
438,Pre-chopped onions do not become poisonous if left overnight,"A Facebook post claiming that cut onions become dangerous and poisonous to eat when left overnight is FALSE.The post claims that it is dangerous to cut an onion and leave it overnight in order to to use it to cook the day after because it becomes highly poisonous and creates toxic bacteria. The post further claims that this may cause adverse stomach infections from excess bile secretions and even food poisoning.However, there is no evidence that any such reactions occur once an onion is cut.The United States Department of Agriculture says whole peeled onions have a shelf life of 10–14 days refrigerated, while diced and sliced onions typically stay fresh for 7–10 days when refrigerated.The National Onion Association in the United States says onions can be stored safely in a sealed container in a refrigerator for up to seven days after they are sliced or cut up.McGill University’s Office for Science and Society says that onions are not especially prone to bacterial contamination, stating that the opposite happens, as the chemical compounds released after the onion is cut are harmful to bacteria.“Cutting an onion triggers the release of enzymes that initiate a chemical reaction producing propenesulfenic acid, which in turn decomposes to yield sulphuric acid. It is the sulphuric acid that makes you cry by irritating the eyes. This same sulphuric acid also inhibits the growth of bacteria,” says Joe Schwarcz, the director of the Office for Science and Society.He adds that onions dry out soon after they are cut, while bacteria grow in moist environments. Bacteria also prefer a protein-rich growth medium and onions don’t contain much protein at all.The post also gets some fundamental things wrong. Bile is produced in the liver and is transported through the bile ducts to the small intestine. It does not cause stomach infections. The stomach itself contains a powerful acid that is likely to destroy any bacteria contained in the onion, assuming any of it is left over once the onions are cooked.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that pre-chopped onions left overnight after chopping are poisonous to eat and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The motion was to be tabled by Kieni MP Kanini Kega.However, the National Assembly tweeted on May 25 that the Order Paper circulating on social media did not originate from the House, which is currently in recess.Mr Michael Sialai, the clerk of the national assembly, also released a statement stating that the House Business Committee, which is responsible for approving motions to be debated in the assembly, has neither met nor deliberated on business to be conducted on June 2.The clerk also pointed out errors in the fake Order Paper, including the indication that the motion to impeach DP Ruto will be debated during the Sixth Session of the House, yet parliament is currently in its Fourth Session.

443,Scientists in the US have not discovered a cure for COVID-19,"An article claiming that scientists in the United States have discovered a coronavirus cure “that works 100 percent” is FALSE.The article claimed that Sorrento Therapeutics — a biotechnology company — had in its possession a COVID-19 cure.However, on May 15, the California based company clarified it had discovered an antibody that was effective in blocking the virus that causes COVID-19 during early testing in cells. Trials are yet to be conducted in living animals and humans. The announcement said the antibody could potentially be used to develop a drug to treat COVID-19.Sorrento Therapeutics researchers screened and tested billions of antibodies to narrow their coronavirus treatment candidates down to hundreds. They found a dozen that could prevent the viral protein from grabbing onto a key receptor in the body. The virus uses that receptor to enter human cells.The chief executive of Sorrento Therapeutics, Henry Ji, said in an interview on May 18 that the drug will be tested in clinical trials in a few months to see its effectiveness against COVID-19, check its safety for this particular use and determine the proper dosage.Sorrento has only conducted tests in cells. In order to gain the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the US agency responsible for ensuring the safety of drugs among other things, the firm will need to advance trials of the coronavirus treatment to animals. Then, Sorrento will have to apply for FDA permission to test the treatment for safety and effectiveness in humans.Dr. Rollins Makokha, a surgery resident at Kenyatta National Hospital, told PesaCheck that when the human body is invaded by a foreign body like a virus, the immune system responds by creating antibodies, which are proteins that neutralize the invader body. This is happening to people who are fighting SARS-CoV-2 around the world. Research is ongoing to find out if the antibodies produced are specific, adequate and long-lasting.Researchers around the world have been working to develop viable vaccines and treatments for the novel coronavirus that has infected more than five million people worldwide. But experts have said that a vaccine for the virus will not be available for widespread use for at least 12 to 18 months.While patients can and do recover from coronavirus infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that there is currently no approved vaccine or treatment and no specific antiviral medicines that are known to work against COVID-19.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that scientists based in the United States have discovered a coronavirus cure ‘that works 100 percent”’ and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

He also warned the Senegalese people on the dangers of self-medication.In addition, Marie Khémesse Ngom Ndiaye, the director-general of public health, on May 11 said in a video that the only entity capable of validating the use of COVID-Organics in Senegal was the Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health and Social Work.PesaCheck looked into a claim that a Senegalese scientific committee approved the use of COVID-Organics after confirming its effectiveness and found it to be PARTLY FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",PARTLY

He never mentioned the US or China in that video.Furthermore, if Rajoelina had indeed said these remarks, they would have dominated the local and international press. However, there is no evidence of any such quote on any credible media outlets.There was no such statement on Rajoelina’s official Twitter account.At the same time, the US and China have clashed in recent months on the origin and the spread of the coronavirus, while Bill Gates has been the subject of conspiracy theories which accuse his foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, of complicity in the spread of the virus.COVID-Organics is a herbal remedy produced from artemisia, a plant with proven efficacy against malaria, and other indigenous herbs developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA).Despite the World Health Organization cautioning that there are no medicines or vaccines that have been proven to prevent or cure COVID-19, a number of people, including some presidents, have not stopped exploring any potential treatment that might provide a way out of the devastating lockdowns that are collapsing national economies, and the rising death tolls linked to COVID-19.PesaCheck checked a Facebook post claiming that Madagascan president Andry Rajoelina claimed to have received money from the United States and China to poison COVID-Organics and found it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

It is a condition where small clots form in the bloodstream, blocking small blood vessels. The increased clotting depletes the platelets and clotting factors needed to control bleeding, causing excessive bleeding.Aspirin is effective as an anticoagulant, because it prevents the platelets, which cause clotting, from clumping together. However, COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not a vascular one, therefore it is unlikely that aspirin would be effective.World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson Mr Tarik Jasarevic, told PesaCheck in a telephone interview that the organization does not recommend self-medication with any form of medicine, including aspirin and antibiotics.“While some remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no scientific evidence at the moment that any drug can cure or prevent the disease,” he said.A COVID-19 containment measures guidance published by the Italian health ministry, where the claim is supposedly from, makes no reference to the use of aspirin in the treatment of COVID-19.The guidance advises those with suspected or confirmed infections to “rest, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food, and wear a surgical mask that must be changed every day.

It promises much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage, and more stable connections.The first case of COVID-19 was reported on December 31, 2019, in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The coronavirus has ever since spread widely across the globe, infecting more than 4.9 million people and killing over 324,000 as of May 20.The virus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2, has affected almost every country on the planet, including tens of nations that are yet to roll out the 5G infrastructure.The World Health Organization says that no research links exposure to wireless technology to negative health effects. The UN agency, on its myth busters platform, also says that 5G mobile network technology does not spread COVID-19.WHOs spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told PesaCheck that the claim that 5G mobile communication technology is linked to the coronavirus pandemic is scientifically unfounded.“There is no research that proves that there’s a connection between 5G technology and the new coronavirus infection,” said Tarik.COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. People infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness. The infection spreads mainly through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that 5G is behind the COVID-19 pandemic and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:

These measures will supposedly remain in effect until June 6, according to the post.The claim was also shared on another Facebook account on the same day.Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna issued a statement on May 20 to clarify that the closure does not apply to all malls, eateries and restaurants in the country, but only those in Eastleigh area of Nairobi and Mombasa’s Old Town.The clarification comes a couple of days after Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe’s May 20 extension of restriction on movement for residents of Eastleigh and Old Town, which was first declared on May 6, when Kenya had recorded a total of 581 COVID-19 cases.The CS on May 20 said that the directive to close malls, eateries and restaurants came after the National Response Committee on COVID-19 noted an increase in the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the country, and extended the duration of the lockdown in Eastleigh and Old Town to 6 June.On May 22, the Ministry of Health announced 52 new cases of COVID-19, bringing to 1,161 the number of people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus since the first case was recorded on March 13.

457,Leso Oxi is not a confirmed COVID-19 remedy,"A Facebook post claiming that Lesotho has launched a COVID-19 remedy is FALSE.The post claims that the remedy is the reason why the Basotho people of Lesotho have been immune to the coronavirus. It adds that the remedy is a mixture of 16 herbal antioxidants found in Lesotho, including artemisia, blue gum leaves, pepper bum leaves, garlic and ground ginger.Another herbal concoction, COVID-Organics from Madagascar, also contains artemisia, and the World Health Organization has offered to support the design of a study to look into it.The Facebook post further adds that Leso Oxi has been used in Lesotho for centuries to fight severe flu called Ntaramane, which, according to the claim, is similar to COVID-19.However, Lesotho’s Ministry of Health announced the first COVID-19 positive case on May 13, making it the most recent African country to report a coronavirus infection at the time this article was published.The post is illustrated with an image showing a number of Leso Oxi bottles, which was first published on May 18 on a Facebook page created the same day by Reckzen Empire, the company manufacturing this variant.The page claims that the liquid extract is a mixture of 16 antioxidants that help the lungs to exchange gases more effectively. This claim is repeated by the post in question, although it is modified to show that the concoction has been used in Lesotho for centuries to fight severe flu called Ntaramane, which it claims is similar to COVID-19.However, Reckzen, also known as Dereckzen Empire, the manufacturer of the product, told PesaCheck that although Leso Oxi has been used to fight common flu and respiratory problems, the herbal juice has not been sanctioned either by the government of Lesotho or the WHO as a Covid-19 cure.“It’s true some patients who took the herbal concoction have fully recovered from influenza and respiratory problems but we can’t totally call it a cure although it has been proven effective in helping COVID-19 patients,” Rorisang Khumalo, a director at the company, told PesaCheck via email.While both COVID-19 and influenza causes respiratory problems and are transmitted through contact, droplets and fomites, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that there are major differences between the two diseases.However, the speed of transmission is an important point of difference. Influenza has a shorter incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than coronavirus.There is no mention of Leso Oxi in the Lesotho government’s dedicated Facebook page for COVID-19, with safety precautions against the disease strictly limited to compliance with the WHO guidelines.While a number of drug trials are ongoing, there is currently no proven drug that can cure or prevent COVID-19 according to the WHO.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Lesotho has launched a COVID-19 remedy, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

This decision was made after Kenya recorded an increase in COVID-19 cases entering Kenya through the Tanzanian and Somali border points.The following day on May 17, President Magufuli stated that he would not close Tanzania’s borders as it would have an adverse effect on the country’s economy.Following the Kenyan directive, Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner Anna Mgwira directed that cargo trucks from Kenya using the Holili border point be barred from entering the country.‘’All cargo trucks owned by a Tanzanian citizen looking to enter Tanzania or are owned by a foreigner but the product was ordered by a Tanzanian, will have to find another truck to transport the cargo to its destination. Trucks from other states will not be allowed to enter,” she said.On the same day, Tanga Regional Commissioner Martin Shigella banned entry to trucks and cargo from Kenya while allowing free movement to those from Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Two days later, Ms Mgwira visited the Holili border and witnessed the challenges experienced by Tanzanian lorry drivers at the crossing point as they waited to be cleared into Kenya.However, President Magufuli on May 20 said that he had spoken to President Kenyatta regarding the border row and agreed to sort out the challenges faced by lorry drivers and traders and that normalcy will be restored soon.PesaCheck has checked a Facebook post claiming that Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli has closed the border with Kenya and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

Others are Bidco Africa’s Gentle Care, Lili (Kenbrands International Company), Msiri (Mafleva International Ltd), Shi shi Natural (Shishi Naturals) and Spotless Advanced (Havana East Africa Trading).On May 17, KEBS announced that it was suspending the permits of the listed manufacturers of hand sanitizers, adding that it would withdraw the use of KEBS standardization stickers by the affected brands.This decision was arrived at following market surveillance that showed the products did not meet the required instant hand sanitizers specifications. Some of the general requirements include the hand sanitizers having an acceptable odour, and being clear, colourless, and in the form of liquid gel.“The manufactures of the said products are instructed to discontinue manufacturing or offering for sale the affected sanitizers. The manufacturers are required to recall all the substandard sanitizers from the market and institute corrective actions whose effectiveness shall be confirmed by KEBS before the suspension of permits is lifted,” read the statement.KEBS urged the public to be on the lookout for products suspected to be substandard and verify that the KEBS mark of quality on products is valid.Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are recommended by the World Health Organization as one of the ways to prevent transmission and slow the spread of COVID-19 due to their ability to inactivate the coronavirus.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that KEBS has suspended permits of eight hand sanitizer manufacturers over low quality and found it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:

461,the government of Kakamega County collect Ksh890 million in revenue in the 2018/19 financial year?,"In a statement posted on the Kakamega County government’s Facebook page on February 25, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya urged leaders to exercise prudence in expenditure. He made the remarks while opening the county assembly session and noted that county revenues have more than doubled, growing from Ksh890 million in FY 2018/19 to a projected Ksh2 billion in the current financial year.The governor urged members of the county assembly (MCAs) to prepare for austerity measures after revenue collection by the national government fell short by Ksh100 billion. Consequently, it is expected that in the 2020/21 financial year, the equitable revenue share for counties will drop by Ksh4 billion from the Ksh320 billion recommended by the Commission on Revenue Allocation.So, the question is did the Kakamega County government collect Ksh890 million in revenue in the financial year 2018/2019?PesaCheck looked into the claim and found it to be TRUE, based on the following:County governments are responsible for raising local revenues as stated in Chapter 11 of the Constitution of Kenya and are authorised to impose such taxes as are allowed by an Act of Parliament.In support of this, the principles of devolved government, as envisaged in Article 175 (b) of Kenya’s constitution, state that county governments shall have reliable sources of revenue to enable them to govern and deliver services effectively.The constitution also addresses the specific responsibility of county governments in revenue collection. Article 209 (3) says devolved units can generate local revenues by imposing property rates, entertainment taxes and other taxes only after authorization by an Act of parliament.Kakamega County Budget and Review Outlook paper for the FY 2018/19 shows that the county’s revenue collection from local taxes hit Ksh896.6 million. Despite the substantial increase in revenue, the county missed its revised target of Ksh1 billion ending up with a final revenue shortfall of about 10%.This is a marked leap in tax collection compared with previous years.Below is a table showing the trend in Kakamega County annual own-source revenue collection for the last four financial years.Source: Office of the Controller of Budget, Programme based budget for the government of Kakamega CountyIn the FY 2015/2016, the county’s own-source revenue collection registered a peak before declining in subsequent years. Own-source revenue collection for FY 2018/2019 jumped by more than 100 percent over the preceding fiscal year when Ksh441 million was generated. With this development, Kakamega county realized almost 75 percent of its annual target, and is expected to collect close to Ksh2 billion by the end of the current financial year, according to the governor.The governor says the revenue will finance the provision of essential services and complete flagship projects such as the construction of Kakamega Referral Hospital.The above data shows that Governor Oparanya’s claims on revenue collection are accurate. Kakamega County’s collection of revenue increased to Ksh896 million collected in the FY 2018/2019 compared to Ksh441 million in the preceding year, and this is confirmed by the Office of the Controller of Budget.Therefore, the claim that Kakamega County collected Ksh896 million in FY 2018/2019 is TRUE.",Did

It also does not indicate when or where the veteran trade unionist made the remarks.Instead, the article appears to be an opinion piece calling on Mr Atwoli to resign for engaging in national politics at the expense of fighting for workers.Mr Atwoli has criticised the deputy president, suggesting that he should not be allowed to contest in the 2022 general election.DP Ruto is widely expected to vie for the presidency in the 2022 polls as President Uhuru Kenyatta wraps his second and final term.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli said he will resign from his position to focus on stopping Deputy President Ruto’s presidential ambitions and finds it to have a FALSE HEADLINE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE
474,Isiolo governor did not stage a photoshoot at the County Referral Hospital with borrowed ICU beds,"A Facebook post claiming that Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti borrowed intensive care unit beds from a private hospital and put them on display at the Isiolo County Referral Hospital for a publicity event before returning them is FALSE.The post contains four photos that supposedly show the beds being transported to the county hospital, and claims that the beds were later removed once the ceremony to launch the intensive care unit (ICU) and high dependency unit (HDU) at the facility was over.The third photo shows Dr Kuti presiding over the launch ceremony and is similar to the one shared by the governor on April 10, the day he launched the ICU and HDU units to help in the fight against COVID-19 in Isiolo county. The rest of the photos, however, are inconsistent with the claim.The first photo shows the ICU beds being loaded into a black pick-up truck outside an unidentified private hospital but the second image shows a cream-coloured pick-up truck arriving at the referral hospital. If the photos were authentic, the same truck which was loaded with the equipment should have been the one that arrived at the destination.The fourth photo, which claims to show ICU beds being offloaded on their return to the private hospital, is a slightly enlarged identical copy of the first photo and shows the same black pick-up truck with the same people in the same position outside a door.Speaking after a meeting with the Isiolo COVID-19 Response Committee on May 1, the governor denied claims that he borrowed the ICU equipment for publicity and blamed the claims on his political rivals and activists. In a video posted on the governor’s official Facebook ‘delivery unit’ page, Kuti said that the beds were purchased from Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS) and all receipts and documents were available in support of this.He asked the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) to look into the matter and apprehend those behind the claims, saying they should not politicise the fight against COVID-19.“The people of Isiolo do not want politics. They want help. When the time for it (politics) comes, I will compete with my rivals as I have always done in the past,” the governor said.Speaking on phone, Mr Shadrack Meme, MEDS marketing manager, confirmed to PesaCheck that they supplied the beds and other medical equipment to Isiolo County government, adding that the consignment was delivered in a completely covered truck contracted specifically for the purpose and not an open-top pick-up truck.“I am actually the one who delivered other specialised equipment like patient monitors and I was there on April 10 when they launched it and I also gave a speech,” Mr Meme said.Mr Shadrack Meme (left) inspecting medical equipment during the launch of the ICU and IDU unit at Isiolo County Referral Hospital.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Isiolo governor borrowed a few ‘good looking’ ICU beds from a private hospital to use them for a publicity stunt and then returned them, and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
475,There are no human COVID-19 vaccine trials in Kenya at the moment,"An article claiming that human testing of a COVID-19 vaccine is currently being conducted in Kenya is FALSE.The article alleges that scientists from Oxford University in the United Kingdom are in the country, and are recruiting volunteers at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) Center for Geographic Medicine Research in Kilifi county.Researchers from Oxford University have started human trials of a candidate vaccine in the UK on March 23, with two volunteers receiving the injection, the first of more than 800 people recruited for the study. The team conducting the trial have indicated interest in conducting trials in Kenya, but this is yet to be approved.Kemri’s head of corporate affairs, Davies Mkoji, refuted the claims and told PesaCheck on phone that there are no ongoing vaccine trials on Kenyans in Kilifi as claimed in the article.“KEMRI is not hosting any foreign researchers who are working on a COVID-19 vaccine. As a matter of fact, we are in the process of developing our own vaccine locally and have even shared our proposal with the Senate on April 21,” Mkoji said.Mkoji said Kemri has qualified local researchers who are already working on a trial vaccine and the organization will update Kenyans regularly on the progress towards this goal.According to the World Health Organization, there were eight vaccines in clinical evaluation as at 30 April, and about 70 others in the pre-clinical evaluation stage. Of the eight,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that there are six stages of vaccine development: exploratory, pre-clinical, clinical development, regulatory review, and approval, manufacturing, and quality control.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the human phase of a COVID-19 vaccine trial is currently being conducted in Kilifi, Kenya and finds it FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
476,This post claiming that Kawangware will be locked down for COVID-19 mass testing is a hoax,"A Facebook post claiming that residents of Kawangware in Nairobi will be placed under compulsory lockdown from May 6 for COVID-19 mass testing is FALSE.The post said the lockdown would take effect at 7 pm and that door-to-door testing will follow, and that essential supplies such as food would be provided by the government.However, the government spokesperson, Cyrus Oguna, refuted the claim in a phone interview with PesaCheck.“The government does not intend to lockdown Kawangware on the evening of May 6 to conduct mass COVID-19 tests in households. In a bid to tame the spread of the pandemic in the country, the Ministry of Health already rolled out a voluntary testing exercise in Kawangware, Eastleigh, and Mvita-Mombasa on May 1 which is ongoing,” said Oguna.Oguna said mass testing is essential for tracking down cases with symptoms, identifying those they live with and tracing and isolating anyone they may have been in contact with so as to contain the virus spread.On May 6, the government placed Eastleigh estate in Nairobi and Old Town, Mombasa under a 15-day lockdown after the country recorded 47 new cases — the highest one-day COVID-19 case tally. Old Town and Eastleigh accounted for the majority of the new cases with 32 and 11 cases respectively. As of May 15, the country has recorded 758 cases and 42 deaths from the pandemic.Meanwhile, Kawangware has been identified by the Ministry of Health as one of the COVID-19 hotspots.A study by UN-Habitat says social distancing, which is the physical separation of about two metres between individuals, in poorly planned and congested urban areas is a challenge. Social distancing and avoiding close contact with others is believed to be the most effective way to contain the spread of COVID-19.According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 spreads from droplets emitted through breathing, coughing, sneezing, and talking, and individuals may be infected without showing symptoms. On May 1, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said that 71 percent of COVID-19 patients in the country are asymptomatic.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that residents of Kawangware area will be put under lockdown from the night of April 6 for COVID-19 mass testing and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

It was agreed that the country would furnish the AU with details about COVID-Organics, which will be reviewed and assessed by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The results of the assessment will inform any further actions that the Union may take.On April 29, President Rajoelina presented COVID-Organics to other African leaders during a teleconference meeting. The meeting was attended by 12 African leaders, and convened by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in his capacity as the AU chairperson. This convention involved AU heads of state and chairpersons of the Regional Economic Communities (RECs), and was set to discuss actions and initiatives undertaken to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the continent.The other ten African leaders who were present at the meeting were; President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, President Félix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo, President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta of Mali, Chad’s President Idriss Deby Itno, President Ali Bongo of Gabon, President Issoufou Mahamadou of Niger, Sudan Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and Mohammed Taher Sayila, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Libya.These are the same leaders who were mentioned as having approved the use of COVID-Organics, but this is not the case.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that African heads of state have approved Madagascar’s herbal remedy against COVID-19 and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

Mr Poghisio and Mr Kang’ata will be deputised by Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo and nominated Senator Haji Farhiya Ali respectively.The changes in the Jubilee Party’s Senate leadership were made following a parliamentary group meeting hosted by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House Nairobi on May 11, bringing together senators from the president’s Jubilee Party and the Kenya African National Union (KANU).KANU had announced a post-election pact with Jubilee on May 4, ahead of the State House meeting.Both Mr Murkomen and Ms Kihika had served in their positions since August 2017, advancing the legislative agenda for the ruling party and transacting government business in the Senate.Poghishio is one of the three KANU senators who attended the Jubilee PG after the May 4 post-poll pact.Mr Murkomen and Ms Kihika, along with 20 other senators, protested their removal to Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, but the changes were eventually effected during a Senate seating on May 13.According to the Senate Standing Orders, the majority party is at liberty to make changes to its leadership in the House provided that it communicates its decisions in writing to the speaker of the Senate.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Jubilee Party has replaced senators Kipchumba Murkomen and Susan Kihika as Senate majority leader and majority whip respectively, and finds it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:
479,Prolonged face mask use does not lower oxygen circulation in the blood,"A Facebook post claiming that prolonged use of face masks reduces the circulation of oxygen in the blood and can lead to death is FALSE.The post lists the dangers of prolonged use of face masks claiming, among other dangers, that it may lead to death. The post shared on May 11 advises that masks should be removed when a person is alone or at home and only worn when in crowded places.The American Journal of Blood Research published a study on the body’s need for a continuous supply of oxygen, stating that vital organs such as the brain, muscles and liver need to be adequately supplied in order to ensure that they function normally. A low level of oxygen in the blood is known as hypoxemia and causes a condition called hypoxia, which could lead to potentially fatal complications.The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing face coverings in public settings, especially in situations where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.These coverings range from homemade cloth and sponge masks to surgical masks with built-in respirators that protect the wearer from airborne particles and liquids.PesaCheck has previously explained the importance of mask use to prevent the spread of COVID-19, noting that N-95 respirators and surgical masks should only be used by frontline health workers who face a greater risk of exposure to the coronavirus disease in their work environment. The rest of the population is advised to wear modified cloth masks that, while less effective in filtering air, still provide protection.Surgical masks and respirators, which are more effective filters, do not cause low blood oxygen levels, according to studies.A 2014 study published in the Journal of Lung, Pulmonary, and Respiratory Research on the effect of wearing surgical masks and respirators for a long duration reported increased levels of discomfort after wearing the masks for three hours. However, the study does not cite blood oxygen levels as a concern.The study found that the N-95 masks could cause breathing problems especially to people with underlying respiratory illnesses, but this was due to factors such as different temperatures and humidification of outer and inner mask surfaces, issues that were limited to surgical masks.However, surgical masks and respirators should be worn for limited periods as they can pick up germs and end up being contaminated.According to the CDC, the most significant risk from wearing masks is that of contact transmission from touching the contaminated mask surface.Healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients are advised to wear disposable masks and are required to get rid of them each time they attend to a different patient or whenever they feel that the mask may have been contaminated.Dr. Emanuel Okunga, an epidemiologist at the Ministry of Health, told PesaCheck that breathing in excessive carbon dioxide is dangerous to the body. He added that people with pre-existing respiratory diseases might face challenges breathing through tight-fitting masks, such as the N-95 respirators, for prolonged periods.Dr. Okunga said that prolonged breathing in masks leads to rebreathing of exhaled carbon dioxide. “This is because while wearing a mask we breathe in the air we exhale and if this happens over long durations, this air contains carbon dioxide and can make someone feel fatigued.” He, however, clarified that the levels of carbon dioxide likely to build up in masks is tolerable to people exposed to it.“People wearing surgical or modified cloth masks — even those with underlying health issues are in little to no danger of breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon dioxide,” added Dr. Okunga.Dr. Okunga added that it is safe to wear masks for prolonged periods. Adding that masks are professionally designed and if they are worn properly and are of appropriate size and shape, they cannot lead to suffocation and death.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that prolonged wearing of facemasks is associated with a decrease of oxygen circulation in the blood and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

An application is considered complete once the applicant fills the form online, including the space for a confirmation code that the applicant will supposedly receive by SMS as an acknowledgement of receipt of the Ksh 400 delivery fee.A WhoIs search shows that the website containing the application form was created on May 6, the same day that the post advertising the giveaway was shared, and a day after the Facebook page was created on May 5.PesaCheck reached out to Bajaj Boxer Kenya, one of the organizations mentioned in the advertisement, and the company stated that they are not running any such programs.Lorna Makokha, the customer service executive at Bajaj, told PesaCheck in a phone interview that they are not involved in the giveaway as claimed, and they are not affiliated with the Facebook page running the advert.Ms Makokha also shared links to the company’s Facebook page and website, and these do not contain any mention of the promotion listed.The same case holds for the Jack Ma Foundation and the Dangote Foundation websites, which are also mentioned on the Facebook post.A Google search of the United States Charity Clubs and Washington Clubs, which are mentioned as part of the free motorbikes initiative, shows that these organizations do not exist.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post advertising a free motorbikes giveaway program that is supposedly set to benefit at least 1,000 youth in Kenya and finds it to be FAKE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:

491,Murang’a County built an ICU centre in less than 30 days,"A Facebook post by Mohammed Hersi claiming that Murang’a County in central Kenya built an Intensive Care Unit Centre at the Murang’a Level Five Hospital in less than 30 days is TRUE.The post adds that the construction of the facility was accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria confirmed to PesaCheck that the 35-bed capacity facility was built in 19 days. The story on the construction of the ICU facility was also carried by both the Daily Nation and Star newspapers.“The idea to build an ICU center at the Murang’a Level Five Hospital was conceptualized a few days after the country reported its first COVID-19 case. Our county engineers worked together with local youth day and night for three weeks and the work was done,” said the governor during a phone interview.On April 13, Governor wa Iria announced that his government would build an ICU facility with 35 beds within three weeks.On March 29, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said that the country has 1,000 ICU beds. An article published by PesaCheck on March 31 on the number of ICU beds in the country revealed conflicting numbers from different sources. The numbers provided by the Ministry of Health differed with the 533 provided by Economist David Ndii.Intensive Care Units and beds are needed to manage serious COVID-19 cases, which require critical care equipment such as monitors for observing patients, and ventilators to monitor patients and assist their breathing.Kenya had reported 535 COVID-19 cases as of May 5, with 24 fatalities and 182 recoveries.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Murang’a country built an ICU facility in less than 30 days and finds it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:
492,Kenya has not received a COVID-19 vaccine from the UK,"An article claiming that Kenya is the first African country to receive a COVID-19 vaccine from the United Kingdom is FALSE.The article published on “Habari Freshi” website on May 3 indicates that Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Mutahi Kagwe announced that Kenya had accepted the vaccine developed by a British laboratory.The article says that the CS announced this on May 3, adding that the vaccine will be distributed to all health facilities in Kenya as from May 4.However, the CS did not make such an announcement nor did he make any public address on May 3. Before this date, the CS had addressed the nation on May 1 during the daily COVID-19 update.Subsequent updates from the Ministry of Health were made by chief administrative secretaries Mercy Mwangangi and Rashid Aman, as well as the Health director-general, Patrick Amoth. None of them mentioned receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine from the UK.An official at the Health director-general’s office told PesaCheck in a phone interview that the ministry is not aware of the supposed COVID-19 vaccine from the UK.“As far as we are concerned at the ministry level, we do not have anything of that nature and if we do, it will be formally communicated by the ministry,” he said.The next time CS Mutahi Kagwe addressed the nation was on May 5, when he revealed that the ministry had recorded 45 new cases of COVID-19 over a period of 24 hours — the highest number of positive cases that have been recorded in a day since the virus was first confirmed in Kenya on March 13.The Health ministry’s official Twitter and Facebook accounts, which often update the public on matters concerning COVID-19, have not mentioned receipt of the purported vaccine either.President Uhuru Kenyatta on April 25 said that the government would inform the public once a vaccine has been approved for human trials in Kenya.This came after false reports claimed that researchers from Oxford University are offering Ksh100,000 to Kenyans who are willing to volunteer for COVID-19 vaccine trials.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Kenya is the first African country to accept a vaccine from a laboratory in the UK and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

A second tweet on Mate Tongola’s thread shows an image of a bowl full of hailstones. The video was also shared on the OMGVoice Kenya Facebook page, and on the Tik Tok Kenya Twitter account on May 3.However, a Google reverse image search shows that the video is not from Kenya.The clip first appeared on video publishing website DailyMotion on April 19, with a caption stating that it was hail falling on a flooded field in the Chitawan district of Nepal on April 19, 2020.The video has been republished on a number of websites claiming that it was captured in different locations. A tweet posted on April 26 claimed that the video was from Chhattisgarh state in India, while Vietnamese website TinTuc claimed that the hailstorm was in Cao Bang province in Vietnam.However, Indian fact-checking website News18 confirmed that the video did not originate from India or Vietnam.Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta announced on April 25 that 29 people died as a result of heavy floods in West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties after torrential rainfall pounded the area. There are however no reports of hailstorms occurring in West Pokot.President Kenyatta urged people living in flood-prone areas to move to higher ground.PesaCheck has looked into a video claiming that there was an ‘abnormal’ hail storm in West Pokot and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
494,"The Jack Ma Foundation has not donated 500,000 COVID-19 test kits to Kenya","A Facebook post claiming that Kenya has received a donation of 500,000 COVID-19 test kits from the Jack Ma Foundation is FALSE.The post questions why Kenya had only done 17,992 coronavirus tests by April 28 yet it received a half-million swabs and test kits, 300 ventilators, 4.6 million masks, 200,000 sets of personal protective equipment, face shields, temperature guns and gloves.Embedded in the post is the April 29 cover page of The Star newspaper, whose headline was a story about the Kenya Medical and Research Institute (KEMRI) running out of test kits. KEMRI is responsible for evaluating all diagnostic kits in the country.The World Health Organization (WHO) says that test kits are vital in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 and recommends that countries test all suspected cases of the disease to suppress the spread of the virus. Tests enable authorities to treat and isolate patients and their recent social contacts.Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna confirmed in a phone interview with PesaCheck that the government received an assortment of medical supplies from the Jack Ma Foundation, including test kits and personal protective equipment.“We have received a total of 20,000 COVID-19 testing kits and other medical equipment to help in the fight against the pandemic. The donations have been brought into the country in two batches, with the first one delivered on March 24 and the second batch on April 15,” he said.Jack Ma announced on his Twitter account that each of the 54 African countries would receive 20,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 1,000 medical protective suits and face gear.The second consignment consisted of 500 ventilators, 200 protective suits and face shields, 200,000 thermometers, 1 million swabs, and extraction kits, and 500,000 gloves that were distributed to all the 54 countries within the continent.In a press statement dated April 27, the Africa Centres for Disease Control confirmed that it had received the third batch of medical supplies from the Jack Ma Foundation.“The donation is to support COVID-19 response by African Union member states and it includes 4.6 million masks, 500,000 swabs, and test kits, 300 ventilators, 200,000 sets of protective clothing, 200,000 face shields, 2,000 temperature guns, 100 body temperature scanners, and 500,000 pairs of gloves,” part of the statement read.Oguna confirmed that Kenya is yet to receive its share of the third consignment but the supplies are expected to be dispatched from Ethiopia soon.Kenya has so far reported 465 COVID-19 cases, with 167 recoveries and 24 fatalities as of May 4.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Kenya has received 500,000 COVID-19 test kits from the Jack Ma Foundation and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
495,This ‘Wanted’ poster of a Nairobi surgeon over defilement allegations is fake,"A Facebook post claiming that police are looking for Dr Samson Robert Misango over allegations of defiling a minor, is FALSE.The post was published on the Citizen Weekly Facebook page on April 25 and claims that the consultant general surgeon and urologist, who works at the Medical Surgery and Urology (MESU) Center in Nairobi is wanted by police over an allegation that he defiled a 17-year-old girl.According to the post, the incident took place at the doctor’s office in West Park Suites in Parklands, on April 19 and was reported to police on Sunday afternoon under OB number 28/19/04/2020.Five photos are attached to the post: one showing a ‘WANTED’ poster that includes the DCI logo, Misango’s photo, and contact information of the DCI stating that he is a wanted suspect, another showing a letter referring to the OB number on a letterhead with the Kenya Police logo, and three photos — two of Misango by himself and another of him with a girl.This post was shared on multiple Facebook pages, including 45 Million Strong, Kenya Insights, Bigwig Kenya News and the Magazine Kenya News.However, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) denies issuing an arrest warrant for Dr Misango, adding that although the OB number 28/19/04/2020 exists, the information it contains is not the same as claimed in the Facebook post. Responding on Twitter, the DCI adds that investigating officer Sgt. Chris Ong’aria, who is mentioned in the Facebook post, is not known to the officer commanding station at Parklands police station.Speaking via phone with PesaCheck, Dr Misango said that the story is fabricated.“I have no idea about the people — the alleged 17-year-old victim and her mother Scolastica Kerubo. The image of a girl captured with me is of my daughter in a photoshoot we were in. But it is true I have an office in that place [West Park Suites], it is true I am a surgeon, and it is true I have a V8. So people can build a story around that but it is a fabricated story,” he said.The photo of Dr Misango and his daughter was posted on his Facebook account on March 8.“That weekend [April 19] I was busy in surgery. I was operating that afternoon then I went to the barber shop and went to the house. I didn’t go to the office,” he added.Dr Misango told PesaCheck that he found out about the claim on social media, and he suspects that he is being attacked because he is very opinionated and posts strong medical and social views on his Facebook account.He reported the incident to the police on April 26. “We are following up and we will get to the perpetrators.”PesaCheck has looked into the claim that police issued an arrest warrant for Nairobi-based surgeon Dr. Misango for allegedly defiling a minor and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
496,HEADLINE: This modified ARV drug is not a vaccine against HIV,"A Facebook post claiming that Professor Benson Edagwa, a Kenyan scientist based in the United States has discovered a vaccine against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has a false headline.The article gets a number of key things right, including the fact that the new drug is not a cure for HIV, but its headline states that the discovery is a vaccine, which would require an immune response against the disease.However, Professor Edagwa’s discovery has led to the development of an antiretroviral (ARV) drug that can provide protection against HIV for a year, which would eliminate the need for a daily ARV dose as is currently the case. The drug can also prevent viral transmission, but does not treat HIV.A statement from the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) where Dr Edagwa is an assistant professor, indicates that the new drug could function as a ‘vaccine mimetic’, protecting the body against HIV infection for an extended time period of time.The details of their study were published on April 27, in Nature Materials, a peer-reviewed biomedical research journal.Changing the current administration of ARVs to one injectable dose per year to control the disease could help to overcome the risk of missing daily ARV treatment, which is a major healthcare concern, given the potential of the virus to rebound and negatively impact the overall health of a HIV-positive individual.PesaCheck has looked into the an article with a headline claiming that a that US-based Kenyan scientist has unveiled the world’s first yearlong antiretroviral (ARV) for prevention of HIV and finds it to have a FALSE HEADLINE.",FALSE
497,Developing a COVID-19 vaccine could take KSh100 billion and 7 years,"A Facebook post claiming that the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) would need Ksh100 billion and seven years to develop a vaccine against coronavirus is TRUE.The post adds that developing a new vaccine is a lengthy and laborious process, and that Kemri had begun the process of building a COVID-19 candidate vaccine prototype.Kemri’s head of corporate affairs, Davies Mkoji, confirmed to PesaCheck in a phone interview that the claim is true.Mr Mkoji added that Kemri is in the process of developing its COVID-19 vaccine and the researchers involved have suggested that developing a vaccine successfully could be a costly and laborious exercise, given the fact that the disease is new, and the process itself needs to be done iteratively.“Manufacturing a vaccine from scratch that could be widely used by people of different genetic makeup could take several years of trials before it is commercially viable,” he said.A study published by the World Health Organization corroborates Kemri’s sentiments. It says that “for many of the newest vaccines, manufacturers will invest many years and several hundreds of millions of dollars.”The WHO study adds that some vaccines take longer to develop than others, and some vaccine trials are more expensive than others.An article on History of Vaccines — an educational resource by the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, says that many new vaccines take 10–15 years to develop.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccines go through three different phases of trials. During Phase I, small groups of people receive the trial vaccine to determine the general safety of the drug.In Phase II, the clinical study group is expanded and the vaccine given to people with different characteristics (such as age and physical health), similar to those for whom the new vaccine is intended.In the final phase, the vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and safety. The trials are randomized, and patients are grouped — there is usually a control group and one or more other groups for comparison.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that it could take up to Ksh100 billion and seven years to develop a vaccine from scratch and finds it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:
498,A US-based Kenyan scientist has modified an ARV drug to make it effective for a year,"A Facebook post claiming that a Kenyan scientist based in the United States has unveiled the world’s first yearlong antiretroviral (ARV) for prevention of HIV is TRUE.The story, which was also covered by a number of local publications, including The Star, indicates that Professor Benson Edagwa led the research team that developed the potential new treatment for HIV. Details of their study were published on April 27, in Nature, a peer-reviewed biomedical research journal.Dr Edagwa is an assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC).According to a statement from the institution Dr Edagwa, working together with the chairman and professor of the department, Howard Gendelman, led the research team that developed the drug by reformulating a month-long ARV drug into a once-per-year dose.“My research interests are in the areas of design, development and evaluation of antiretroviral prodrugs, development of long-acting slow effective release ART (LASER ART). A single administration of LASER ART significantly extends the half-life of therapeutic compounds” — Dr Benson Edagwa.Dr Edagwa worked to develop the drug in collaboration with Dr Howard Gendelman and members of the nanomedicine laboratory at UNMC.According to Dr Gendelman, this pharmaceutical development has the potential to not only treat but also prevent viral transmission.Changing the current administration of ARVs to one injectable dose per year to control the disease could help to overcome the risk of missing daily ARV treatment, which is a major healthcare concern, given the potential of the virus to rebound and negatively impact the overall health of a HIV-positive individual.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that US-based Kenyan scientist has unveiled the world’s first yearlong antiretroviral (ARV) for prevention of HIV and finds it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:

It does not cite a source for these claims.Additionally, the article does not state when or where the monetary incentive for Kenyan volunteers was announced, and there is no information about this on Oxford University’s COVID-19 vaccine trials website either.While it is true that the Oxford team expressed the intention to approach the government of Kenya for permission to carry out vaccine trials in the country, there is no mention that this will include monetary incentives to volunteers as claimed.The University of Oxford News Office told PesaCheck that the institution was yet to initiate deliberations with the Government of Kenya and scientists at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) on the matter but would do so once the trials in the UK are deemed successful.In his address to the nation on April 25, President Uhuru Kenyatta said that the government would communicate if and when it approves human trials for COVID-19 vaccines in Kenya.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that scientists from Oxford University are offering Ksh100,000 to volunteers for a COVID-19 vaccine trial and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
500,China has not developed a vaccine for COVID-19,"A tweet by Pakistani journalist Saadia Afzaal claiming that China has developed a COVID-19 vaccine is FALSE.Ms Afzaal’s tweet appears to be based on an interview that she had with General Aamer Ikram, the executive director of the National Health Institute in Pakistan, who stated that Pakistan would receive the vaccine from China ‘pretty soon’.In the interview with Ms. Afzaal, General Akram revealed that the said vaccine is not ready for commercialization, adding that it should be available for use in three months’ time if clinical trials are successful.Speaking in Urdu, Ms Afzaal states that China has taken the lead in developing a vaccine, and would include Pakistan. She asks General Akram how long the trial would take, and when a vaccine would be ready, to which he responds by saying that a vaccine would be available in three months. The video was translated by Uzair Rizvi of AFP India/South Asia-PacificMs Afzaal also shared a letter signed by Li Can, the General Manager at Sinopharm International Corporation, a state-owned Chinese company that researches, manufactures and distributes medicines and other healthcare products. The letter states that Sinopharm would conduct collaborative trials of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in Pakistan.The letter further states that Sinopharm’s inactivated vaccine is still at the clinical trial stages, and has not been approved for public use. It is not ready for launch as Ms Afzaar claims.An inactivated vaccine consists of dead disease-causing pathogens or fragments of pathogens that have been grown in a lab culture, and that do not have the capacity to produce the disease in question. In contrast, live vaccines use living pathogens, but are almost always weakened to reduce their disease-causing ability.Inactivated vaccines may not provide the same level of protection as live vaccines, and they often require multiple booster doses to provide long-term immunity.The COVID-19 outbreak, which was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, has spread across the world with over 3.1 million confirmed cases and at least 217,000 fatalities from the disease as of April 28.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that China has developed a COVID-19 vaccine and finds it to be misleading.

501,Kenya’s courts have not allowed the government to tap phone conversations,"A Facebook post claiming that the Court of Appeal has allowed the State to tap into private phone conversations is FALSE.The claim, which originated from an article published by the Standard newspaper (subscription required), adds that the Court of Appeal has allowed the Communications Authority of Kenya to install a mass surveillance system that will pave the way for the government to listen in on private phone conversations.Activist Okiya Omtatah had filed a case at the Court of Appeal to stop plans by the State for the development of a mobile management system. In his case, Omtatah said the mobile management system could be used to monitor private conversations.The Judiciary says the case is about a deal where the Communications Authority of Kenya had engaged mobile network providers in the country with a proposal of installing a system that detects stolen phones and counterfeits.The Judiciary has refuted the claim that the Court of Appeal had given the government a green light to tap phone conversations, saying that the Standard article is misleading.According to a tweet by the Judiciary, the court directed that the stakeholder engagement should be completed and the rules subjected to public participation before any further action is taken.The Court of Appeal ruled that further development of the system, which is still in the architectural stage, should await stakeholder consultation and public participation.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Court of Appeal has allowed the State to go ahead with plans to tap into private mobile conversations and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
502,This ad for free gas cylinders from K-Gas is fake,"A Facebook post advertising free K-Gas gas cylinders from KenolKobil is fake.The post was published on April 27, stating that KenolKobil — the Kenyan company that produces K-Gas — is distributing free gas cylinders to at least 500 homesteads in each ward to support homesteads during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Facebook post links to a website where visitors can register and book one of the free gas cylinders, stating that the promotion is the result of a donation of gas cylinders.Applicants need to be Kenyan citizens over the age of 18 in possession of a valid national ID. Booking a cylinder would need one to pay delivery fees in advance and choose between the 6kg gas cylinder, which the site says is delivered at Ksh250, or the 13kg gas cylinder delivered at Ksh350.The instructions further state that the delivery fee is to be paid via M-Pesa to a Dr Agnes Nbugua, who the site claims is the head of finance and procurement at KenolKobil. Applicants are required to fill the form to proceed, and to also include the SMS confirmation code after making the payment.However, a WhoIs search of the website linked on the post with the promotion shows that it was created on April 24, two days before the Facebook post with the promotion was published on April 27.The ‘Free Gas Cookers from K-Gas’ Facebook page was created on April 25, according to Facebook Page Transparency.KenolKobil has also distanced itself from the ad, warning the public in a Facebook post on their official page that the advertisement for free gas cylinders is fake, and the page with the promotion does not belong to the company or any of its authorized K-Gas dealers.KenolKobil’s communication and trade marketing manager, Loise Gitonga, also told PesaCheck in a phone interview that Dr Agnes Nbugua, who is mentioned on the promotion page, does not work for the company.“Anything they have mentioned there is non-existent, apart from the photos which they have taken from our website.

504,There is currently no evidence that pregnancy puts women at greater risk of getting COVID-19,"A Facebook post claiming that pregnant mothers are more likely to contract COVID-19 is FALSE.Responding to comments on his own post, the author says he got the information from KTN News, a television news bulletin broadcast by Nairobi-based Standard Media Group. He makes no mention of the research it is based on or the organisation that conducted it.Pesacheck got in touch with KTN News, who confirmed that they published a story by Reuters, on their print publication, The Standard. The story, however, shines a spotlight on the plight of expectant women in malaria-prone areas during the COVID-19 pandemic given that pesticide spraying to kill mosquitoes has been suspended due to lockdowns.According to the article, a combination of these factors is what puts them at a higher risk of contracting both malaria, COVID-19 or even vulnerable to misdiagnoses as the two diseases carry similar symptoms, rather than the mere fact that they are pregnant as claimed.Although pregnancy does cause changes in the body and immune system, making expectant mothers more susceptible to some respiratory infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) says there is currently no evidence that they are more prone to COVID-19 than the general population.WHO adds that research is still underway to understand the full impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women, but in the meantime, urges them to take the same precautions to avoid the virus as other people.These include washing hands with soap or sanitising with an alcohol-based rub, maintaining social distancing, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth, and seeking medical attention early if one has a fever, cough or difficulty in breathing.There is also no evidence that COVID-19 can be passed from an expectant mother to her child either during pregnancy, at the time of delivery, or through breastfeeding.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that pregnant mothers are prone to COVID-19 and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
505,There is no evidence that coronavirus was made in a lab,"A photo shared on Instagram with text claiming that coronavirus originated in a laboratory is FALSE.The claim was shared with a photographic image of Professor Luc Antoine Montagnier, a French virologist, indicating that the claim was attributed to the 2008 Nobel laureate.Prof. Montagnier made the claim during an interview with French television channel CNews on 17 April, and restated it on 22 April in a podcast published by Pourquoi Docteur (Why, Doctor?).In both interviews, Prof. Montagnier claimed that the genetic sequence of coronavirus contains elements of human-immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which he and his colleague discovered in 1983.He further claimed that the virus was accidentally released from a Chinese laboratory during the development of a vaccine against HIV. However, his argument was based on a paper published on bioRxiv, an open access repository of research papers that are not peer-reviewed, but undergo basic screening and checked against plagiarism. BioRxiv indicates that the paper, which is titled ‘Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag’, has since been withdrawn by the authors with the intention to revise it in response to comments received on the technical approach used, as well as the interpretation of results.There is consensus in the larger scientific community that SAR-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, originated in animals, with the potential starting point being an open-air market in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province, and not in a laboratory or as an artificially manipulated virus as claimed.On April 21, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said all available evidence suggests the novel coronavirus originated in animals in China and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory.PesaCheck has looked into a claim that the novel coronavirus was created in a laboratory and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The cost of flying the helicopters per is Sh500 million, the post further claims.However, the official Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) Twitter and Facebook accounts show that helicopters were only used once in recognition of medics. This was on Tuesday, April 21.An official from the Ministry of Defense’s public affairs department told PesaCheck in a telephone interview that the helicopter was only flown on April 21 and that the initiative did not cost Ksh500 million as claimed in the Facebook post.A tweet posted by Kenyatta National Hospital on the same day thanked KDF for the banner message ‘God Bless Medics’ that was flown by the helicopter over the hospital.KDF also tweeted a video showing the helicopter flying the appreciation over Nairobi.Defence Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma also tweeted the helicopter video captioning that KDF stands with medics, who are “our heroes and heroines”.The CS tweeted a separate video on April 21 showing the KDF helicopter flying a banner message that read “Stay At Home”. Neither the CS nor KDF have posted additional videos showing that helicopters flew on any subsequent day.Subsequent posts on KDF’s Twitter account and its website show that the KDF helicopters have been used to provide rescue and relief services to Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet residents affected by floods.There is no evidence that the helicopters were flown on any other day, and such a public spectacle would not have missed.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that government helicopters are being used to deliver daily thank you messages to medics and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

The post says funds are limited and those who are interested are advised to make an instant claim by clicking the link contained in the Facebook post.The link on the post directs to a website advertising the funds, stating that the money will only be available until April 20. The website further states that a total of 109,717 citizens have already claimed their share of the money, leaving just1,936 relief packages before the support runs out.To get the money, qualified visitors are required to fill a questionnaire that asks whether they are citizens of Kenya, the amount of cash they need to sustain themselves during the lockdown period, as well as how they will use the money.The last step requires applicants to share the advertisement with seven WhatsApp groups, after which they are told to provide the name of their bank and account details in order to have the funds instantly credited to their accounts.While the Facebook post contains the coat of arms of Kenya, the announcement of lockdown relief funds is not mentioned on any official government platform.The questionnaire is hosted on Blogspot, a free blog-publishing service that is rarely used by legitimate government or state-related institutions or established private organizations.A similar advertisement was debunked on South Africa’s Western Cape Government’s Facebook page.

515,there a link between COVID-19 and 5G technology?,"A theory suggesting that 5G wireless technology is fueling the spread of COVID-19 has advanced rapidly on social media platforms, leading to attacks on mobile technology infrastructure, such as the burning of masts and threats to engineers.This claim appears to be based at least in part to the fact that the expansion of 5G coverage coincided with the onset of COVID-19, with proponents arguing that the delayed onset and slower spread of COVID-19 in Africa is due to lower levels of adoption of the new technology.There are broadly two arguments being promoted. On one hand, that 5G, the fifth generation of wireless technologies, acts indirectly to suppress the immune system, thereby making people more vulnerable to infection by the virus, and on the other, that 5G is directly responsible for the spread of COVID-19.So, the question is, does 5G help transmit COVID-19?PesaCheck looked into the claims of a link between the introduction of 5G and the spread of COVID-19 and found the following:The COVID-19 outbreak has claimed the lives of thousands and left many more in hospitals in its wake. As of April 20, more than 166,000 people have died worldwide, and there are over 2.4 million confirmed cases of infection, according to Johns Hopkins University. Those who have recovered from the disease now number more than 600,000 worldwide.While the virus was slow to reach Africa, compared to other parts of the world, the infection has grown rapidly in recent weeks and continues to spread. The region has registered more than 15,000 confirmed cases and over 1,100 deaths. Multiple theories have arisen to explain the slow entry of COVID-19 into the continent, including claims that Africa is not as affected by the outbreak because it is “not a 5G region”.5G is the latest in a series of mobile connectivity technology standards. It promises greatly enhanced speed, coverage, and responsiveness of wireless communication networks. Like previous generations of wireless network technology (4G, 3G, and 2G), 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves, a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum of waves, which all emit energy called electromagnetic radiation.Other types of technology that use radio waves include smart meters, TV and radio transmitters, and radar and satellite communications.One of the feeding theories is a claim of shared maps in a tweet from Oli Guerrero that shows an overlap between countries that had COVID-19 cases and countries that had rolled out 5G. The theory also explored the fact that Africa has low 5G installation, hence low COVID-19 penetration.Though the shared maps are not accurate, the correlation does not mean causation. Only 34 countries currently have 5G networks as of January 2020, but there are confirmed COVID-19 cases in 184 countries. Meanwhile, Kenya has 281 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 20, despite not having an active 5G coverage while Morocco has one of the highest records of COVID-19 cases in Africa despite operating a 4G network.The claim is that COVID-19 is caused by 5G radiation and that 5G lowers one’s immune system was also shared by Stop5G Australia, an anti-5G group on Facebook, which linked COVID-19 to radiation caused by 5G. A petition calling on the Australian government to stop the 5G rollout due to its perceived negative effects on the immune system is in circulation.The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology fall under the non-ionising radiation category in the electromagnetic spectrum. Non-ionizing radiation is too weak to break chemical bonds or remove electrons when in contact with human tissue, unlike ionizing radiation, which has a higher frequency, such as x-rays, gamma rays, and ultraviolet light, which can cause cancer.Source: VodafoneThese theories have gained momentum with the backing of high profile personalities. Actor Woody Harrelson and singer Keri Hilson have both shared content with online fans suggesting a link between 5G and COVID-19. Chris Oyakhilome, a Nigerian Pastor also shared a sermon linking the COVID-19 pandemic and 5G.COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus that belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which infect both animals and humans. In humans, the disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever and difficulty in breathing. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.Currently, the source of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 is unknown, but all available evidence suggests that it has a natural animal origin and is not a manufactured virus. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, the SARS virus (SARS-CoV) was believed to have jumped from an animal to humans and then spread between people.According to WHO, COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from infected people to others with whom they are in close contact through respiratory droplets or by direct contact with infected persons or contact with contaminated objects and surfaces.The World Health Organisation says no adverse health effects have so far been linked to exposure to 5G wireless technologies.WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told PesaCheck that the claim that 5G mobile communication technology is linked to the new COVID-19 is scientifically unfounded.The UK Government Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport said on Twitter that “there is absolutely no credible evidence” of a link between 5G and COVID-19.Meanwhile, the UK Public Health says overall exposure to 5G radio waves is expected to remain low measured against the restrictive guidelines laid out by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and, as such, “there should be no consequences for public health.”Prof. Leonard Mabele, a lecturer at Strathmore University, told PesaCheck that the 5G frequencies are non-ionising and not harmful to human beings. He further said that COVID-19 implication from 5G just does not exist.In conclusion, COVID-19 is primarily spread from person-to-person contact and there is no evidence 5G radio waves cause or exacerbate the spread of the disease.",Is
516,This photo does not show hands burnt after applying sanitizer,"A Facebook post claiming to show a photo of a woman whose hands were burnt after using hand-sanitizer is FALSE.The post, published on March 24 by Ann Taieth, warns people not to go to the kitchen after using hand sanitizers. The post further claims that the burns on the hands shown in the photo resulted from hand sanitizer catching fire.However, the image of hands used to illustrate this claim does not show the symptoms of a burn. It shows the effects of skin grafting, which include the appearance of a fishnet pattern on the skin, and concentrated redness that is separated from the rest of the skin by a straight line.According to Dr Adrian Wong, the photo appears to be of a burn victim whose forearm was harvested for skin grafts. In an article on Techarp, Dr Wong states that an actual burn would not look like the right arm on the picture in the Facebook post because of the sharp edge and the pattern formed on the skin.An article on the Healthline website indicates that a full-thickness skin graft would involve taking skin from areas such as the forearm. The article adds that the area from where skin is harvested is usually pulled together and closed in a straight-line incision as is the case on the Facebook post. Skin grafting may also involve ‘meshing’, where the doctor may punch multiple holes in the graft, which in the long term, may cause the skin graft to take a “fish net” appearance.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of alcohol-based sanitizers, or hand washing with soap to prevent the spread of COVID-19 viruses. The UN agency also cautions that all alcohol-based products are potentially flammable. Therefore, the sanitizer should be allowed to dry after being applied to minimise the risk of fire. This is also mentioned on the Dettol website as part of the safety information, warning users that alcohol-based sanitizer is highly flammable and should be kept away from fire or flames.A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that there have been very few reported incidents of fires related to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, even when the products contain ethyl alcohol that makes them flammable. In another report the CDC notes that alcohol evaporates rapidly, making the exposure time for it to catch fire difficult to achieve.The US Department of Transportation also published a report on the flammability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer in 2010 following the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. According to the report, hand sanitizer, which is approximately 60% alcohol by volume, is flammable. However, it tends to burn at a relatively low temperature compared to fuel, plastic, or cellulose fires. The report shows that the vapor from the sanitizers could not be ignited at room or elevated ambient temperatures (up to 37°C/100°F) without external heating.An experiment by Avinash Anandawade testing whether hand sanitizer can catch fire once rubbed on the hands found that the alcohol in the sanitizer evaporates quickly after application, and therefore cannot catch fire.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that hand sanitizers can catch fire and cause severe burns when used near a flame and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
517,Kenyans still paying the same fuel prices as they did in December 2019?,"The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted economic activity worldwide and led to a dramatic drop in fuel prices as demand for oil dwindles, and yet there’s been little change in what Kenyans pay for fuel at the pump.On March 23, 2020, Mr Mohammed Hersi, the Kenya Tourism Federation chairman, posted on Facebook that Kenyans were still paying a pump price of Ksh108, which was the ‘same price in December 2019 yet the world oil price had dropped by 50%’.These claims set off a conversation online. William Wa Mukaria blamed politically entrenched cartelsAnother Facebook user, James Rut, said it had more to do with procurement although Mr. Hersi was doubtful.Mr. Rut was supported by Elizabeth Njuguna, who said: “The price will come down, but in June. Fuel for the country is procured using the open tender system. Whoever bids the lowest, wins and brings in cargo for the rest of the industry. Whatever you are using today was bought way back in December. So, if they reduce the price today, they’ll go at a loss because it was bought at December’s prices.”Pesacheck investigated how fuel prices are determined in Kenya and found the following:The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a historic decline in demand of oil across markets as productivity and travel slow down. Governments have enforced movement restrictions intended to slow down and control the rate of infection and spread of the disease. These measures include lockdowns, suspension of school and industrial production, all of which impact demand for fuel.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global demand for oil will contract for the first time since the global recession of 2009.In March 2020,IEA’s executive director, Dr Fatih Birol, said, “The coronavirus crisis is affecting a wide range of energy markets — including coal, gas, and renewables — but its impact on oil markets is particularly severe because it is stopping people and goods from moving around, dealing a heavy blow to demand for transport fuels.”Beyond the pandemic, politics among oil producing countries is a key determinant of the cost of oil at source. In March 2020, Saudi Arabia kicked off an oil price war with Russia. Saudi Arabia and Russia have been working together to prop up oil prices for the past three years but after a falling out over OPEC’s proposal to curb supplies by an extra 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), Russia walked out of the agreement, leading to the collapse of OPEC. The biggest crash in oil prices since the 1991 Gulf War followed.The following month, major oil-producing nations agreed to the largest production cut of 10 percent in output, in an unprecedented coordinated effort by Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States to stabilize oil prices and, indirectly, global financial markets.Plunging oil prices come as good news to net oil importers like Kenya, indicating the possibility of pump prices coming down. Still, the cost of fuel for consumers has been slow to fall and consumer prices at local fuel stations lag way behind the international market.Kenya’s petroleum retail prices are controlled through price capping by the Energy & Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA). Each month, EPRA sets maximum retail pump prices for selected products. Prices become effective and remain in force from the 15th of the calendar month until the 14th of the following calendar month. Pricing regulations are meant to ensure reasonable consumer prices, the government says.Retail firms have a say in determining the final pump prices for oil within the margins defined by EPRA, keeping in mind unique local conditions and logistics that could affect their profitability.In March 2020, EPRA announced a drop in fuel prices, reducing super petrol, diesel and kerosene prices by KSh2.00 per litre, KSh2.80 per litre and KSh7.23 per litre respectively.A month later, EPRA reviewed pump prices agan, which saw massive decreases: a Ksh18 in super petrol per litre, kerosene by Ksh18.8 and diesel by Ksh4.09.These latest changes are based on the fall in average landed cost of imported super petrol from USD472.59 per cubic metre in February to USD 309.03 per cubic metre in March. The cost of landing diesel fell by 9.89 percent — from USD480.21 per cubic metre to USD432.70 per cubic metre and kerosene decreased by 37.70 percent, from USD421.24 per cubic metre to USD262.44.EPRA data shows that fuel being sold in Kenya during the April 15, 2020 to May 14, 2020 price computation was bought about two months earlier, in February, when the cost of landed oil was still high.Kenya has an Open Tender System. This means crude or petroleum products are purchased by a single company for the entire market on the basis of a public tender and the imported oil is shared among all marketing companies in proportion to their market share. Oil is transported by pipeline, running from Mombasa to Nairobi and through to Western Kenya with terminals in Nairobi, Nakuru, Eldoret and Kisumu. The pipeline is managed by the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC).The petroleum sector has over 50 oil marketing companies working alongside the government-owned National Oil Corporation of Kenya. These companies participate in the importation of petroleum products for the country, whose demand is approximately 500 million litres a month.Refined petroleum products are off-loaded at the Kipevu Oil Terminal (KOT) into the Kipevu Oil Storage Facility (KOSF). KOT handles 90% of the country’s imports. According to the Ministry of Energy, the KOSF has a storage capacity of 326 million litres and an operational capacity of 269 million litres, which does not meet Kenya’s demand.Retail prices for various oil products vary from one oil marketing firm to the other, based on their individual transport and other operational costs and profit margins. Mombasa consumers pay the lowest fuel prices while people in the northern town of Mandera pay the highest price.The consumer price for petrol, kerosene and diesel also incorporates hidden costs such as pipeline transport, depot losses, storage and distribution costs in addition to the landing price. At the pump, a host of taxes and levies are added to all petrol and diesel imports, including Excise Duty, Road Maintenance Levy, Petroleum Development Levy, Petroleum Regulatory Levy, Railway Development Levy, Merchant Shipping Levy, Import Declaration Fee and Value Added Tax. Kerosene attracts all these, plus an Anti-adulteration levy.Anticipating the massive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kenyan government is proposing new taxes to prop up the economy. The proposals take the form of an amendment bill that introduces a new way of calculating tax on petroleum products, and which will see further rise in the price of diesel, petrol and kerosene.Maximum petroleum pump prices for April 15, 2020 — May 14, 2020Source: EPRAMost East African countries depend on imported crude oil and refined petroleum products from the Middle East region. Since Kenya stopped refining crude in 2013, there is usually a time lag of at least a month between the placement of import orders and delivery of the commodity at the Port of Mombasa, meaning local prices do not immediately reflect global market trends.Economic growth is also a factor that affects petroleum products and therefore crude oil demand. Growing economies increase the demand for energy in general and especially for transporting goods and materials from producers to consumers.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

520,No report in Nigeria that 21 people died in Lagos after getting a COVID-19 vaccine,"A report published in ‘Kenya Trending News’ claims that 21 people infected with COVID-19 have been confirmed dead in a private hospital in Lagos after being administered with a COVID-19 vaccine.Headline by Kenya Trending News site.The publication reported that the 21 infected people died barely six hours after the vaccines were administered in a private hospital in Lagos State. No such incident has been recorded or reported in Nigeria.On April 5, 2020, the day the report was published, Nigeria confirmed 210 cases of COVID-19 infections and the total number of reported deaths from the disease were four.By April 15, Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Health and the the country’s Centre for Disease Control, NCDC disclosed that the number of people infected had risen to 407, with 128 having recovered and while 12 had succumbed to the disease.The report did not name the private hospital in Lagos where the incident is alleged to have taken place.The picture used by ‘Kenya Trending News’ to illustrate the article has no connection with the report. It was first published on April 4 by Reuters, in an article titled “Trump: ‘Going to be a lot of death’ in U.S. next week from coronavirus”.‘Kenya Trending News’ linked their report to the scandal surrounding suggestions made by two French doctors that the first human vaccine trials for COVID-19 be carried out in Africa.However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that there is no vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus which has not been previously found in humans. According to WHO, there is also no specific medication for treatment for the disease at the moment. Currently, two vaccines are at clinical trial stage while 42 others are at the preclinical stage of evaluation.There is also no scientific evidence to support the suggestion that Africans have genetic immunity to the virus as was recently debunked in a report by PesaCheck.As reported by WHO, the “infodemic” of false coronavirus claims on COVID-19 is critical and requires constant attention to ensure that people are accurately informed.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that 21 people died in Lagos, Nigeria after being given a COVID-19 vaccine and found it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
521,outbreak and a fake news pandemic in Kenya,"I recently received a phone call from a frightened citizen asking me what we are doing as fact-checkers to help combat the spread of misinformation around COVID-19. He sounded concerned, and said “almost everyone on social media has become a coronavirus disease expert with a majority of them spreading false information.” This is a concern that I share too. For the past two months, I have debunked over 40 false claims on COVID-19 and they keep coming.COVID-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Scientists are still learning about how it spreads and the severe illness it causes. The infection has advanced rapidly across the globe and has infected over 2 million people and killed over 129,000 in 177 countries as of April 15 with Europe, North America and Asia being the most affected continents.Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, fact-checkers in Kenya have debunked multiple claims that were shared millions of times on social media platforms.Misleading claims about the pandemic have encouraged people to disregard medical advice and take unnecessary risks with their lives. A good example of the impact of misinformation is an incident in Iran in March this year where hundreds of people died and more than 1,000 others got sick after ingesting methanol because of a rumor that alcohol could provide protection against the coronavirus infections.The potential real-world repercussions of such posts are plain to see.The story of Jude Ikuenobe, a Nigerian man who was falsely accused on social media of using a COVID-19 patient to extort money from people, provides another good example of the impact of misinformation. On March 20, the BBC reported that soon after Nigeria recorded its first positive coronavirus case, a false story alleging that ‘Jude’ had picked up the patient who had tested positive and was demanding money from the public so as not to spread the disease. The impact of the story on Jude, the man whose photo was used in the post, has been real. He received death threats and no longer feels safe going out alone.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, fact-checkers have been fighting a similar tide of false claims and exaggerations. Some of those spreading false information do it with the best of intentions: it is a natural response during uncertain times to pass on advice that you think might help protect family and friends. When that information turns out to be inaccurate, one risks doing more harm than good.An example of fake news in Kenya is a post shared on Facebook many times that made several dangerous claims. Chief among them was the “advice” that if you can hold your breath for 10 seconds or more, you don’t have COVID-19.Medical experts assert that this ‘self-check test’ is not a reliable indication for whether one has COVID-19 or not, and is likely to cause panic. Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, told the Associated Press that the test “will not identify persons who are infected and have mild to no symptoms.” It will also return false positives for people with existing conditions that make breathing difficult.The World Health Organization does not recommend the test. The UN agency recommends that people who suspect they might have COVID-19 stay at home and seek medical attention by calling hotlines provided by local health authorities.A wildfire of false and unverified information about the pandemic is being spread on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and on private messaging apps like WhatsApp where well-intentioned but fearful individuals are forwarding or publishing messages with misleading or doctored information. The form of false information ranges from fabricated warnings about extraordinary measures governments might take to keep people in their homes, to information about fake medications or vaccines, fake images and videos about events related to the pandemic, and false statistics on deaths and infections.Responses to the pandemic have also shaped the infodemic of false information. Entire countries are now in lockdown in a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19. Currently, over 2.6 billion people are living under some form of lockdown across the globe. In many countries, citizens have been asked to stay at home besides observing other safety measures. Given the fact that many people are sequestered in their homes as health officials and governments advise them to avoid public areas, employers have initiated remote work rules and schools have been closed indefinitely. So much of the discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic is happening online providing liars and profiteers along with well-meaning people the opportunity to seize on the frantic search for information.Technology ensures that even when we are in isolation, we can keep communications channels open with loved ones, friends and colleagues through social media platforms and other digital channels. Technology is actually a lifeline for many if not all, but that doesn’t mean that it lacks a downside. Rumors and outright lies are spreading faster than ever before feeding into the anxiety, stress, and fear that many people are experiencing at the moment.Sometimes silly and sometimes dangerous information has spread. Claims that COVID-19 is a biological weapon manufactured in a laboratory, that the virus doesn’t infect Africans or black people, that it only infects the elderly, or can be cured by garlic or saline have probably been seen by millions. While such posts may have generated many clicks and some money in the form of advertising revenue for sensationalist blogs and news outlets, they are dangerous.It is reassuring that fact-checking organizations such as PesaCheck are working in collaboration with Facebook to debunk false information and hoaxes in Kenya. Since the beginning of the year, PesaCheck has debunked hundreds of claims on COVID-19. As governments across the globe fight the COVID-19 pandemic, PesaCheck is fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation.The WHO, CDC and Johns Hopkins University have also been on the front line in the fight against misinformation by providing platforms where people can access reliable information on the pandemic.",COVID-19
522,This video does not show bodies of COVID-19 victims dumped into the sea,"A Facebook post with a video shared by the governor of Nairobi, Mike Sonko, claiming to show bodies of COVID-19 victims dumped into the sea is FALSE.The post reads “some countries throw Covid19 infected dead bodies into the seas.”The video is being shared amid reports that governments across the world are facing challenges in managing a steep rise in the number of dead bodies they must handle due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of unclaimed bodies were recently buried in a mass grave in New York. With more than 600,000 cases and over 30,000 deaths as of April 16, the United States has experienced a surge in coronavirus infections and deaths in the past month.An examination of the video using the InVID video verification tool shows that the clip is linked to a post dating back to 2018, long before the outbreak of COVID-19.A Google search links the video to African immigrants who died in a ship accident off the Libyan coast in 2014 while trying to get to Europe.Media reports indicate that the bodies were found washed up 30 miles east of Tripoli, the capital of Libya. A 2014 report of the same incident carried in the UK’s Daily Mail shows photographs of the rescue and recovery operation in Libya.Data analysed by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees shows that many African migrants die in their attempt to cross the Mediterranean sea to get to Europe every year. In July 2019, up to 150 immigrants were reported dead off the Libyan coast while 137 others were rescued when a boat they were traveling in capsized.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming to show a video of dead COVID-19 victims dumped into the sea and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

They are required to register with one network operator by filling a form with their personal details.However, the terms and conditions of the grant reveal that each beneficiary needs to refer a friend via WhatsApp to the Atiku Care Foundation, a non-profit linked to former Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar, and support his political ambitions in the next general election.The Nigerian politician has donated to his country’s Relief Fund to address COVID-19, which was made through his Priam Group and it did not include internet data grants.Additionally, the domain name of the site offering the grant is ‘c0vid19datagrant.online’. WHOIS information shows that it was created on April 10, 2020 and registered in Panama, indicating that it could be a phishing link out to steal personal data.Further, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) flagged the data grant as a fraud and warned members of the public not to fall prey to such phishing links used by criminals to steal personal information and money.“Such links have largely been found to be infected with malware that triggers mining of personal information, passwords, photos, contacts among other valuables that are subsequently used to extort, for cyberbullying, stealing of finances among other ills,” DCI wrote on Twitter.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Kenyan government is offering a 200GB internet data grant and finds it to be FALSE.",HOAX:

525,DP William Ruto has not resigned from Jubilee Party,"A Facebook post claiming that Deputy President William Ruto has resigned from the Jubilee Party is FALSE.The post claims that the Deputy President said he is quitting the party due to his differences with President Uhuru Kenyatta.Jubilee is the ruling party in Kenya and was formed in 2016. Both President Kenyatta and DP Ruto serve as party leader and deputy party leader of the party respectively. In November 2016, all parties affiliated to the then ruling coalition Jubilee Alliance Party, including the United Republican Party that was founded by DP Ruto, folded to form a single outfit.Jubilee communications director Alex Memusi has dismissed the claim. Speaking to PesaCheck on phone, Memusi said DP Ruto is still a member of the party.“William Ruto is still the deputy party leader of the Jubilee Party and continues to serve as the Deputy President of Kenya,” Mr Alex Memusi, the party’s communications director, said.The party is currently marred by internal wrangles between officials allied to President Kenyatta and those affiliated to DP Ruto following the announcement of changes to the composition of the Jubilee National Management Committee — one of the party’s top decision making organs.DP Ruto opposed the new appointments and has posted a complaint, asking the registrar of political parties to look into the issue.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that DP William Ruto has resigned from the Jubilee Party and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

527,This image claiming to show police arresting citizens for not wearing masks is actually from 2016,"A Facebook post claiming to show an image of police arresting citizens for not wearing masks is FALSE.The post, published on April 9 by one Kibet Jfk, claims to show the image of a policeman who has no mask arresting a citizen for not wearing the same. This comes after Health CS Mutahi Kagwe advised people to wear masks in public places, so as to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.The same image was also featured on the Ghetto Radio website, as part of an article about police arresting people without face masks.However, a Google image reverse search shows that the image on the post was taken in 2016. The original photo was first published in July 2016 and was taken by Daily Nation journalist Tom Otieno. It shows a traffic police officer arresting a bodaboda rider along the Kisumu-Nairobi road.The National Police Service (NPS) also debunked a tweet on April 9, 2020, where an image claimed to show police officers arresting citizens for not wearing masks.This law was on a Kenya Gazette notice dated April 6, and was published in local newspapers on April 10. The new law indicates that every person in a public place must maintain the one meter distance requirement from another person and must wear a mask. Not adhering to these measures makes one liable for a fine not exceeding Ksh20,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 6 months or both.An official at the National Police Service told PesaCheck that the gazettement of this directive means that citizens who will be found in public without masks risk being arrested.“From the moment the law was announced it began taking effect. People, therefore, should go out in public with masks as the law requires,” he said.Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai on April 15 also said that officers will begin to take the next step of enforcing this law.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that a Facebook post shows the image of a police officer arresting a citizen for not wearing a mask and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

An internet search shows that the photo was taken on Moi Avenue in Nairobi by Daily Nation journalist Wahito Kanyiri and was published on March 13, 2020.Although the post also cites a local daily — The Star — as the source of its claim, it doesn’t share a link to the story or indicate when the article was published.A search on the publication’s website, as well as its Facebook and Twitter pages, does not show the story in question.Additionally, the news outlet disowned the post and flagged the story as fake.The Facebook account that posted the claim has since deleted it and changed its profile name and display photo.Further, Dr Kepha Ombacho, the environmental health and safety head at the Ministry of Health, told PesaCheck that he was not aware of any case of a masks hawker admitted at KNH with COVID-19.“I have also seen the claim. It is part of what people are doing — churning a lot of unverified information,” said Dr Ombacho.On April 13, 2020, the Ministry of Health announced that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Kenya rose by 11 to 209, with 40 people having recovered from the disease and nine others losing their lives.PesaCheck has looked into a Facebook post claiming that a face masks hawker was admitted at KNH with COVID-19 and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
530,"the world end on April 12, 2020?","An article published by the Kenyan Times predicts that the world will end on the night of April 12, 2020.The article alleges that the claim was made by the self-proclaimed prophet David Owuor of the Repentance and Holiness Ministry through a video shared online. However, PesaCheck was unable to find the said video.In 2006, followers of the House of Yahwe religious sect in Kenya moved into bunkers in preparation for the end of the world. They had sold their earthly belongings and relinquished their past life after the sect’s leader, American Yisrayl Hawkins, had predicted that a nuclear war between the US and North Korea would destroy the world on September 12, 2006. But it didn’t happen.In 2007, Dr Owuor predicted that an earthquake would hit Nairobi as punishment for “Christians who had gone sinfully secular.” He said that some of the things that were attracting God’s wrath included “the type of dancing and dress during worship.” Owuor said the Lord had spoken clearly to him and, “If the church repents, the magnitude of the earthquake would be reduced.” To date, the earthquake is yet to hit Nairobi.Below are some of the notorious doomsday scenarios in history that fizzled out, just like several other prophecies through the ages. Most of these events had tragic consequences for those who believed in them, but they never actually happened.California preacher Harold Camping had predicted that the world was supposed to end on October 21, 2011. Camping had arrived at the date for the apocalypse through a series of calculations that he claimed were based on Jewish feast days and the lunar calendar.He had also predicted that on May 21, 2011, at 6:00 pm, God’s ‘elect people’ would be assumed into heaven in an event called the Rapture. Saying that those who were not to rapture would remain on earth to wait for their fate in October of the same year.According to media reports, some of his followers sold their homes, quit their jobs, and spent huge amounts of their money in publicizing Camping’s prophecy. When the rapture didn’t occur, camping re-evaluated his predictions saying that the event would occur simultaneously with the end of the world but that didn’t happen too.Towards the end of the second millennium, people across the globe feared that the world would ‘end’ simultaneously with the beginning of the year 2000. This prediction was based on the practice followed by computer programmers of abbreviating year numbers with two digits when developing software. For example, 1999 would be coded 99. At the turn of the century, computers would revert to 00, assuming that the date was 1900 instead of 2000, which led to software errors.There were claims that the ‘Millennium Bug’ threatened banking systems, the safety of weapon systems and even planes. However, at midnight on January 1, 2000, people celebrated the new year and nothing happened.Dorothy Martin from Chicago claimed to have received a message from planet Clarion in the 1950s. She predicted that the world would end in a great flood before the dawn of December 21, 1954. Dorothy and a clique of followers were convinced that a flying saucer would rescue the true believers before the inevitable destruction of the earth. The belief was so strong that some members of the group broke completely with their previous lives, giving away money and other earthly possessions, quitting their jobs, and even leaving their spouses. However, the prophecy didn’t occur.As with other predictions, the said date of the end of the world has come to pass without incident.",Will

In a statement, the bank said the money was meant to support Kenya’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, under the ‘Kenya COVID-19 Emergency Response’ Project.According to the World Bank, the project will provide emergency funding that will be used for medical diagnostic services, surveillance and response, capacity building, quarantine, isolation and treatment centers, medical waste disposal, risk communications and community engagement.PesaCheck previously looked into a similar false claim, which alleged that the Sonko Rescue Team was giving out grants in collaboration with the World Bank.As of April 9, Kenya’s Ministry of Health had confirmed 184 cases of COVID-19, with 12 patients recovering and seven people succumbing to the disease.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the World Bank is looking to direct $50 million to the Sonko Rescue Team and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

My administration has projected that a total of 200m every month will be paid to musicians through the system and other platforms. This translates to over Ksh.2 billion going into the pockets of Kenyan artists,” said President Kenyatta on April 6.The figure of Ksh2 billion was first announced during the president’s address to the nation on January 14, where he revealed new measures to streamline the collection and payment of royalties, stating that the new system would lead to an expected increase from Ksh200 million to Ksh2 billion per year.Kenya has reported 179 cases and 6 deaths from COVID-19 as of April 8, 2020.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that President Kenyatta has allocated Sh2 billion to Kenyan artists to help them cope with the economic effects of COVID-19 and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

The photo shows South African Prophet Rufus Phala of Ark Spiritual Christian Church, who made his church members drink Dettol, claiming that they would be healed of sickness.Dettol South Africa responded to the incident with a post stating that the antiseptic is not meant for oral consumption. No casualties were reported as a result of the incident.The three other images published alongside the post are from 2018 and also show Prophet Rufus administering JIK to his congregants. According to another article on the Daily Sun, Rufus claimed that he had turned JIK into the ‘blood of Jesus’ as part of a ‘miracle service’.

A statement issued by the Ministry of Interior on April 2 indicated that some of the released inmates had completed their jail terms, while others had their sentences and bail or bond terms reviewed by High Courts and Magistrates’ Courts.The statement by the Commissioner General of Prisons, Wycliffe Ogalo, gave an initial number of 3,837 released prisoners and remandees, with 898 prisoners having completed their jail terms, and 2,267 having had had their sentences revised by high courts across the country. An additional 627 inmates were freed after their bail or bond terms were reviewed by magistrates’ courts.Chief Justice Maraga in an interview with Citizen TV said that this number had increased to over 5,000 released prisoners. Mr Maraga said that the high court was in the process of reviewing the files petty offenders who have been jailed for less than six months, and others who have less than six months left on their jail terms.The National Council on the Administration of Justice (NCAJ) held a virtual meeting on March 31, and on April 1, issued a statement regarding the justice sector’s operations in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the statement, NCAJ clarified that the judiciary is still administering its services, but that operations had been scaled down in compliance with the recommendations of the National Emergency Response Committee on COVID-19.The statement cited new measures that will be effected in the justice sector, including the decongestion of prisons, suspending all visits to prisons, and isolating new inmates.

This is a fake account, pretending to be the CS Hon Peter Munya, which is unfortunately promoting lies,” said Ms Makena Mwobobia, the NGO’s director in Kenya.The same advertisement was posted on a Facebook page with the name and image of Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya.However, the page appears to be fake, having been set up on 1 April 2020, a day before the post advertising interest-free loans was published.The claim has also been shared in Tanzania on a page named after Philip Mpango, Tanzania’s minister for Finance, claiming that ActionAid was offering loans in the country. Similar to the Kenya page impersonating CS Peter Munya, this page was set up on April 3 and published the post making the claim a day after on April 4.The post on the CS Munya page contains a link to a Google form where potential applicants are required to fill in their contact details, the business venture they are pursuing, the number of years they have been in business, and the amount of money they would want to be loaned by ActionAid.Further, the site claims that ActionAid has approved $2,480,000 for three projects that would boost the growth of Small and Medium Enterprises in Kenya, and has allegedly released an initial $750,000 towards one project, the Kenya Bora Initiative, in collaboration with Agriculture CS Peter Munya.A Google search on the Kenya Bora Initiative shows that it does not exist online.The form has an image of CS Munya in the company of two other men holding documents with the ActionAid logo.However, a Google image reverse search shows that the photo is manipulated from one taken in November 2019, during the launch of the Kenya Investments Policy and the County Investment launch in Nairobi, which CS Munya attended in his capacity as cabinet secretary for Industrialization at the time.

The WHO states that while garlic is a healthy food that has antimicrobial properties, there is no evidence that eating it can protect people from the new coronavirus.The WHO’s recommended protection measures against COVID-19 are regular cleaning of hands with alcohol-based hand rubs or soap and water, social distancing by maintaining at least one metre (three feet) distance from other people, and coughing and sneezing into one’s bent elbow rather than onto one’s hands.In addition to these measures, the WHO recommends self-isolation and promptly seeking medical advice if symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, cough and difficulty breathing — begin to develop.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that warm weather can prevent the transmission COVID-19 and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

The study also states that the virus can only be transmitted via respiratory secretions in the form of large respiratory droplets rather than small aerosols.The World Health Organization says that transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 through the air has not been reported thus far and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidence. On March 29, the UN agency released an official statement clarifying that COVID-19 is NOT airborne.It is, however, important to note that COVID-19 can be transmitted by breathing in droplets containing the virus which spread within a meter of an infected person, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the face (eyes, nose or mouth) before cleaning one’s hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub.Protection measures against the disease include observing social distancing, which aims to prevent infected people from coming into close contact with healthy people by restricting when and where people can gather. The measures include limiting large groups of people coming together, closing schools, shutting down buildings, asking people to work from home and canceling public events.As of March 31, a total of 787,010 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 37,829 deaths across the globe.

551,Check: Does Kenya have only 155 Intensive Care Unit beds?,"At a time when Kenyans were beginning to ask questions on the country’s preparedness to handle the coronavirus pandemic, Tim Chege tweeted, on March 18, 2020, that there were only 155 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and less than 100 ventilators for patients with respiratory complications.On the same day, the International Research and Development Africa tweeted that there are 130 ICU beds in the country, and that 80 per cent of those are routinely occupied, leaving only 26 available for previously unpredictable situations like patients with severe respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19.COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and is transferred when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.Serious cases of COVID-19 require critical care equipment such as monitors for observing patients, and ventilators to treat a broad range of breathing conditions.Although Kenya has 50 coronavirus cases as at March 30, with one fatality and one patient having recovered, there are questions about whether the resources the country has can deal with the worst case scenario of the outbreak.In Italy, the healthcare system was largely overwhelmed when thousands of COVID-19 patients required hospitalization. It reached a point where medical officers were overwhelmed and facilities struggled to keep up with the numbers of infected. A 2012 report by the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that the country had 3.4 hospital beds per 1,000 people, 80 per cent are dedicated to ICU care. That number is better than the European Union (EU) average, which stood at 69%.The same WHO study established that there were 3.7 practising doctors per 1,000 people, which again was above the EU average of 3.4. The number of nurses was 6.3 for every 1,000 people.With 23.9% of Italy’s 60 million population over the age of 65 years, only Japan has a larger share globally at 25.9%. Italy has a median age of 45.4 years, meaning that half the country is older than 45. A significant proportion of the country is at risk from COVID-19, which more adversely affects older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, which affects 55% to 59% of the country according to a 2017 study published in the European Heart Journal.When the coronavirus pandemic reached Italy, the country’s healthcare system was overwhelmed, and the country was the first to overtake China where the pandemic originated in terms of the total number of cases and number of deaths. It has recorded 97,689 cases and 10,779 deaths as at March 27.Given the fact that COVID-19 is a new disease, and there is no medication yet that has been found to be effective against it, the likely outcome of community spread, where one individual with the disease spreads it to those around them, and in turn those infected go ahead and spread it to others, it is likely that Kenya’s healthcare system would struggle if the pandemic gets out of control and the country fails to flatten the curve — ensuring that those likely to get sick stay healthy and uninfected.So, the question is, how many ICU beds and ventilators does Kenya have at the moment?There is no readily available data on critical care services provided by hospitals registered by the Ministry of Health. We reached out to the ministry officials, who pointed us to Ms Mercy Mwangangi, the chief administrative secretary. She had not responded by the time of publishing this article.In a press briefing on March 29, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe states that the country has at least 1,000 ICU beds, and has recently received 250 ventilators from the World Bank.To get a good idea of the situation on the ground, we turned to the most recent data available: a research article in the East African Medical Journal in 2015 on 21 leading healthcare centres in the country, which included referral, mission, private and level 5 hospitals.The study looked at the availability and serviceability of ICU equipment, availability of essential drugs and diagnostic support services used in care of critically ill patients, and found it to be > 95% in private and mission hospitals, and 60–80% in the other hospitals. This means that at any one point, nine out of ten ICU beds are available at private and mission hospitals, and six to eight beds out of ten in the other hospitals.The report shows that Kenya had 130 ICU beds in 2015, and a number of hospitals have increased their critical care capacity in the five years since the study was published, as well as new medical facilities being opened. Therefore, the claim by Tim Chege that Kenya has 155 ICU beds is plausible.On March 30, economist David Ndii tweeted that Kenya had 533 ICU beds and 259 ventilators. When asked to reveal the source of his data, he said it was from various sources and his research while consulting. PesaCheck could not independently verify this.The Standard Digital on March 28 published a similar claim, saying the country had 518 ICU beds. The publication did not disclose its sources, making it difficult to verify.A Google spreadsheet posted on Twitter on March 30 indicates the number of ICU beds and ventilators available at each private hospital. In total, the document claims 314 ICU beds and 259 ventilators in private healthcare facilities. He did not respond when asked to name the source, but PesaCheck reached out to Karen Hospital, St Luke Hospital, Aga Khan Hospital and St Francis Hospital, which are on the list and their tally of ICU beds and ventilators matched what was on the document.The Ministry of Health has indicated that they have tested 1005 individuals, and the country has recorded 50 positive diagnoses. While it is not clear just how many people could potentially be exposed to the disease at the moment, the Ministry of Health Director-General Dr. Patrick Amoth projects that the number of cases in Kenya could rise to 10,000 by the end of April after instances of community transmission were confirmed.If even 20 percent of that projection (2,000 cases) require hospitalization, the country’s healthcare system would struggle to cope, with some patients not getting access to an ICU bed or ventilator.The data shows that Kenya is inadequately equipped to handle a likely disease outbreak, especially one that is likely to push up demand for specialized treatment and equipment.To protect yourself from the infectious disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that you stop shaking people’s hands, because the viruses mainly spread through respiratory droplets that may be in the hand when one touches their face. The agency advises washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (roughly the same amount of time as singing the ‘Happy Birthday’ song twice), or using a sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol content as a preventive measure.Other preventive behavior includes covering coughs and sneezes using one’s elbow, avoiding touching your face with unclean hands, cleaning high-touch surfaces frequently, and working from home to avoid spreading the virus or being infected.Beyond these individual steps, the CDC and Kenya’s Ministry of Health recommend more interventions such as social distancing, which require staying at least six feet from people who are not family members, to help slow down the spread of the viral infections.",Fact

566,Kenya spending over 61 per cent of tax collections to repay debts?,"Kenya’s debt stock has been the subject of debate in recent years, as the government continues to borrow from international lenders to finance infrastructure projects across the country.According to an opinion piece published in the Standard Newspaper on January 14, 2020, Kenya’s government spends over 61 per cent of tax collections on repayment of debt.The article was based on National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani’s announcement on January 1 that the government was planning to restructure the debt portfolio by refinancing or substituting the commercial elements with concessionary ones.According to the article, the government plans to refinance or substitute commercial loans with cheaper options from friendly countries and developing partners is welcome, since the country is feeling the pinch of spending over 61 per cent of tax collections to repay debt.So the question is how true is the claim that Kenya spends over 61 per cent of tax collections to repay debts?PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Kenya is spending over 61 percent of tax collections to repay debts and found it to be False based on the following:In October 2019, the National Treasury unveiled a debt policy and borrowing framework which issues guidelines on managing the government’s financing needs and payment obligations at the lowest possible cost.The International Monetary Fund raised Kenya’s risk of debt distress from low to moderate in its October 2018 report on the country after the country’s debt hit the 5 trillion shilling mark in May 2018.In November 2019, the Senate approved the National Treasury’s request to review the country’s debt ceiling from a ratio of GDP (50 percent) to an absolute figure of Sh9 trillion. The justification for this was to allow more room for borrowing to offset short term expensive loans.The African Development Bank in its 2019 annual report noted that debt composition in African countries has moved from concessional loans towards commercial foreign debt, which is more expensive to service.The credit dynamics have also changed, with countries shifting from the traditional American and European bilateral lenders to emerging lenders like China. Kenya’s public debt has risen from 41% in 2013 to 58% of GDP in 2019. According to the 2020 African Economic Outlook Report, two thirds of this is non-concessional. Most of the country’s debt stock is held externally (16% of GDP) than domestically (9% of GDP).The country’s public debt stock stood at Sh6.05 trillion as of December 31, 2019. According to the Quarterly Economic and Budget Review report released in February 2020, domestic debt was Sh2.94 trillion (48.6 percent), while Sh3.11 trillion was owed to external creditors, representing 51.4 percent of the country’s total debt obligations.Additionally, the report also shows that revenue collection in the first half of the 2019/2020 fiscal year amounted to Sh930 billion against a target of Sh1.06 trillion. Kenya Revenue Authority collected Sh1.58 trillion against a revised estimate of Sh1.64 trillion in 2018/19. The taxman has consistently missed to hit revenue collection targets set by the National Treasury over the past few years. Missed revenue collection targets widen the country’s budget deficit, which the government plugs through increased borrowing to ensure there are resources for recurrent and development expenditure.A fiscal transparency evaluation conducted by the International Monetary Fund found that between 2010 and 2018, revenue underperformed against the original budget by an average of 8 percent.According to the IMF evaluation, Kenya’s revenue forecasts have been consistently and significantly over-optimistic since 2012/13, reducing fiscal transparency and budget credibility. This also implies that recurrent and development expenditure is pegged on an unrealistic budget, leading to budget cuts in the course of the fiscal year which have serious implications.The Statement of Actual Revenues and Exchequer Issues Gazette Notices published between 2014 and 2020 show that more revenues are going towards the repayment of debt.Kenya’s rising debt portfolio has been a cause for worry, with several entities including credit rating agencies, the IMF and the World Bank raising concerns over the country’s rising debt.While the financial statements from the National Treasury show that the percentage of revenue going to the repayment of debt has been increasing since 2017/2018, it is yet to hit the 60 percent threshold, making the claim that the country is spending over 61 per cent of tax collections to repay debt FALSE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

574,FALSE: The national government has not ‘taken over’ Nairobi County,"An article by Jambo News published on February 25, 2020 claims that the embattled Nairobi Governor handed over the functions of the Nairobi County Government to the National Government.The article further states that the National Government will take over the County functions immediately.While it is true that the Nairobi County Governor has signed an agreement to hand over some functions of the Nairobi County Government to the National Government to enhance service delivery to the citizens, the county is still officially being run by the county government.A press statement shared on February 25 by State House, stated that a number of functions of the Nairobi County Government were handed over to the National Government pursuant to Article 187 of the Constitution.Article 187 allows the transfer of functions and powers between levels of government by an agreement between the governments if the function or power is effectively performed by the receiving government and if it is not prohibited by the legislation under which it is to be performed or exercised.The State House statement, the Governors’ statement and the Gazette Notice No. 1609 stated that some functions were transferred, but some media outlets including the Star and Kenyan News, had either false headlines or inaccurate information on the Nairobi County handed over.The correct position is that the National Government took over the health, transport, public works utilities and ancillary services, and the planning and development services to ensure Nairobi residents receive services efficiently. The transfer was to take effect 21 days from the date of signing and with an initial renewable period of 24 months from the date of execution.A number of other functions such as agriculture, education, environment, information communication technology and trade, and industrialization will still be headed by the County Government.On November 8, 2017, a special task force on the Regeneration of Nairobi Program, a joint partnership between the National government and the County Government of Nairobi was formed to focus on key economic and social sectors: housing, transport, energy, water, environment, youth, women, and persons with disability sector and other sectors with the aim of improving the livelihoods of Nairobi residents.

589,cervical cancer the second most frequent cancer among Kenyan women?,"According to Prof Marleen Temmerman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Aga Khan University Hospital, cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women in Kenya, and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths.In an article published on the Business Daily, Dr Temmerman further states that cervical cancer ranks second after breast cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancers in low-income countries, and the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide.These claims come as the Ministry of Health in Kenya is conducting a nationwide campaign to encourage screening for cervical cancer in ensuring the health and long-term prosperity of the Kenyan people as part of the Big Four Agenda.So the question is, is cervical cancer the second most frequent cancer among women in Kenya ?PesaCheck has looked into the claim by Prof Marleen that cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women, and finds it to be TRUE for the following reasons:Cervical cancer is one of the few cancers that is preventable when detected early. It can be treated much more successfully when detected early than when it is found in later stages, and the World Health Organization recommends regular screening tests and getting the HPV vaccine as a way to reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer.The Kenyan government introduced the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine into its routine immunization schedule in 2019 to protect girls across the country against cervical cancer.The vaccine is effective when administered before exposure to the virus, and is intended to protect women from developing cervical cancer.According to the HPV Information Centre, the most common route for HPV infection is sexual intercourse, and cervical cancer is the most common cancer women between the ages of 15 and 44 in Kenya.Other factors that can increase the risk of cervical cancer according to the Canadian Cancer Society are sexual debut at an early age, having multiple sexual partners, a history of sexually transmitted infections, and cigarette smoking.According to the WHO, cancer of the cervix is the second most common cancer after breast cancer in low-income countries. Globally, cervical cancer ranks as the fourth most frequently diagnosed and fourth most frequent cause of cancer deaths in women. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide followed by colon cancer and lung cancer.According to the IARC HPV Information Centre, approximately 5,250 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed annually in Kenya, putting it as the second most frequent cancer after breast cancer among women of all ages.

590,do Kenyan politicians’ salaries compare to the GDP per capita?,"In a tweet published on May 12, 2019 by Dr. Scott Bellows, a columnist with the Business Daily and a faculty member at the United States International University — Africa, claimed that Kenya holds a dramatically higher politician salary to average GDP per capita of any nation in the world.The tweet was accompanied by a graphic that shows Kenyan politicians earn an annual salary of US$78,500, approximately 97 times more than Kenya’s GDP per capita, which stood at $1,710.51 according to data from the World Bank.GDP per capita is the total value of production by a country divided by its population, and is considered to be a fairly accurate measure of a country’s standard of living, and how much citizens are likely to benefit from their country’s economy.Dr Bellows’ tweet was made after the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) resolved to pay housing allowance for the Members of Parliament. According to the Daily Nation, allowances add up to Sh936 million, consisting of a KSh. 250,000 monthly allowance for each of the 416 members of the two Houses, backdated to August 2018 when their employer, the PSC, resolved to pay housing allowances in addition to their mortgages.This news incensed Kenyans both online and offline with the MPs being viewed as being greedy and selfish.So the question is, do Kenyan politicians earn US$78,500 annually, or 97 times more than the country’s GDP per capita?PesaCheck has investigated the claim that Kenyan MPs earn US$78,500, which is 97 times more than the country’s GDP per capita and finds it to be MOSTLY TRUE for the following reasons;The graphic that Dr. Bellows shared is from VISUALIZING IMPACT, an organization that describes itself as “a laboratory for innovation at the intersection of data science, technology, and design.” Among their goals is to “create impactful tools highlighting critical social issues around the world.”The infographic can be found on their website and it contains a list of sources, however, most of them cannot be accessed at the time of writing the article. Of the 13 listed, only 5 links work or lead to relevant information. The data on Kenya was among the broken links while the link associated with data on Bolivia leads to a 2006 article on Peruvian government salaries. Therefore, in order to verify their claim, further research was required.The infographic was created in collaboration with Raseef22 who gathered the data. Raseef22 is a media platform that is aimed at engaging and informing an Arab civil society audience.At the time of writing, Raseef22 had not replied to inquiries on their data sources.VISUALIZING IMPACT specifies that the calculated politician salaries was for the chosen countries annual salary/income data for “MPs, deputies or equivalent.”MPs salaries in Kenya can be confirmed from the Gazette Notice № 6516 on Remuneration And Benefits For State Officers In The Executive Of The National Government dated 7th July 2017 by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC).According to the Notice, Members of the Senate and National Assembly earn a basic salary of KSh. 621,250 (US$6,140.09) per month. When allowances are included, the amount can rise up to KSh. 1,473,283.The MPs also have generous benefits and loans accessible to them. They include the following:As per our calculation using the sources above, if Kenyan MPs earn at most Ksh.1,473,283 per month, this means that their annual income is Ksh.17,679,396 or US$177,679.Further calculations based on the level of allowances reveals the following:According to the World Bank and United Nations Statistics Division, Kenya’s GDP per capita was US$1,710.51 in 2018, while the IMF records Kenya’s GDP in 2018 as $1,875. Taking an average from the above two statistics, Kenya’s GDP stands at 1,792.76 in 2018.Based on the below following calculations MP’s salaries are upto 98.6 times higher than Kenya’s GDP per capita.Using the data above, Kenyan MPs earn between $74,550 and US$176,794 annually which is between 41.6 to 98.6 times Kenya’s GDP per capita. This makes the claim by VISUALIZING IMPACT and Raseef22 that Kenyan politicians earn an annual salary of US$78,500, which is 97 times the country’s GDP as MOSTLY TRUE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

608,The Chinese Government has not threatened to deport Kenyans infected with COVID-19,"An article published by Nairobi Times claiming that the Chinese Government has threatened to deport Kenyans with novel coronavirus in retaliation to an order to deport Chinese workers in Kenya who lacked proper documentation is FALSE.According to the article, China has threatened to deport Kenyans in Wuhan infected with COVID-19 in retaliation to Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i’s order to deport four Chinese workers who were found to be working in Kenya illegally. One of the workers was caught on camera caning a Kenyan waiter at a restaurant in Nairobi.The article claims that the Chinese Supreme Court issued a note to CS Matiang’i asking him to find other legal avenues to deal with the four Chinese rather than deporting them. The article also does not indicate key details, such as when the note from the Supreme People’s Court was sent, and who specifically wrote it.While the article refers to the ‘Chinese Supreme Court’, it does not have the specifics of who at the court or in the Chinese government had given this order. Additionally, the court is officially known as the Supreme People’s Court, and does not contain any such communication on its official website.There are no reported cases of Kenyans infected with novel coronavirus since the outbreak started according to the World Health Organization. There have been a number of suspected cases, but none has tested positive.The deportation order referenced in the article was issued on 13 February by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, but was suspended by High Court judge Luka Kimaru on 17 February.Additionally, the claim that the Government of China had threatened to deport Kenyans in Wuhan has not been published in any mainstream news outlets, and the government has not mentioned it in any of their briefings.In a press briefing on 20 February, Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna announced that the Kenyan government has released Ksh.1.3 million for students who are trapped in Wuhan, China following the COVID-19 outbreak, adding to a Ksh. 500,000 donation by the Chinese Government to help the students get supplies.There was no mention of deporting Kenyans in Wuhan, which would have been communicated during the press briefing given its significance.Elseba Chepleting, a Kenyan lawyer, told PesaCheck that any communication from the Chinese Supreme People’s Court to the Government of Kenya would be through the ambassador to a court of equal jurisdiction, in this case the Supreme Court of Kenya, and not directly from the Court to the cabinet secretary as indicated in the article.There is no such communication on the website and the Twitter account of the Embassy of China in Kenya.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Chinese Government has threatened to deport Kenyans infected with novel coronavirus and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

Echesa is alleged to have used DP William Ruto’s office to sign off the fraudulent tender.Echesa was arrested and arraigned in court alongside Daniel Otieno, Clifford Okoth and Kennedy Oyoo, on 12 counts of attempted fraud. They denied all the charges and were released on Sh1 million cash bail each.When contacted by PesaCheck, an officer based at the Kabete Police Station refuted the claim, stating that they did not have any murder case record under the name of Roman Musyoki, or that matched the circumstances indicated in the article.A reverse search of the photo used in the article shows that it is from a January 2018 story by Zimbabwean news blog Bulawayo24 reporting on a rape and murder in Gweru, Zimbabwe.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Roman Musyoki, the main DCI investigator in Echesa’s arms deal case has been found dead and finds it to be False.",FALSE:

COVID-19 is a contraction of ‘Coronavirus Disease — 2019’.The name was officially announced by WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom, on February 11, the same day that the article was published.The article states that on February 11, the number of reported infections was more than 40,000 in over 25 countries that had confirmed reported cases of the virus, with more than 1,000 death cases in Mainland China.According to WHO’s situation report on February 11, there were 42,708 confirmed infections in China (2,484 of them new) ,1,017 deaths in China, and reported cases in 24 countries.The article also states, World Health Organization (WHO) have confirmed that the vaccine to counter the virus would be ready in 18 months.However, the World Health Organization has stated that there is no specific vaccine for the novel coronavirus outbreak. The article appears to be based on a press briefing by Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, where he called for basic interventions available at the moment to fight the epidemic, and estimating that a vaccine could be ready in 18 months.

From Monday (3rd February) schools will be sent on an indefinite recess.”However, Garissa County Director of Education Hassan Khalifa confirmed that schools in the area had not been closed as was claimed in the Facebook post, and that learning was going on as normal. the teachers who had been transferred by TSC were replaced with teachers employed by the School Boards of Management.“There is no single school that has been closed. TSC just withdrew part of its staff and we have replaced them with teachers employed by the school boards of management” — Hassan Khalifa.The Garissa County Education Board also asked for the transfers to be cancelled, but did not support the call of some of its members to close schools in the county, even though most of the teachers who were working in the county had left due to insecurity.The board also noted that private schools remained operational and their teachers were on duty, and that only teachers in public schools had requested transfers from the Teachers’ Service Commission.The transfer follows a rise in insecurity in the region, with non-local teachers requesting transfers following an increase in Al-Shabaab attacks, with the most recent being in Kamuthe Primary School located in Fafi sub-county in Garissa on January 13, which left 3 teachers dead. The TSC issued a statement following the attack, and has since begun issuing transfers to non-local teachers in the county.When contacted for a comment on the matter, TSC Head of Corporate Communication Beatrice Wababu confirmed that the transfer process was ongoing, and that the commission is working closely with the Interior Ministry to ensure security is beefed up in the affected areas.

Udoto confirmed that Tim’s tusks had been removed in order to allow for the process of taxidermification, where the elephant’s body would be preserved in an almost lifelike appearance.Thereafter, the tusks will be reattached, and Tim will go on display at the National Museums of Kenya.Born in 1969 to Trista (TD family) Tim grew to become one of Africa’s last ‘Tusker’ elephants whose ivory tusks are so long that they scrape the ground. Usually, only old bull elephants grow their tusks long enough to reach this acclaimed status. However, this phenomenon also makes the elephants vulnerable to poachers.In 2014, Tim was treated for a spear wound in his ear after he was spotted limping in the park and in 2018, KWS rescued the elephant after he got stuck in Amboseli swamps at Kimana sanctuary.Until the death of Tim the Elephant, KWS had a tracker on him to keep the community as well as the elephant safe by enabling the security teams to ward him off agricultural areas.PesaCheck has looked into an image claiming to show men holding tusks of Tim the elephant and finds it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:

There have been numerous attempts to tame the public wage bill which has been growing at alarming levels, putting pressure on the public coffers.In March 2014, President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a directive requiring state officers to take a pay cut. He added that he and his deputy would take a 20% pay cut, while members of the cabinet would have their pay reduced by 10%, and that these funds would be put in the Transformative Fund and be used in development projects.While the data tabulated above shows that CS Ukur Yattani’s claim is TRUE, wage bill as a percentage of revenue has consistently remained above the 35 percent as stipulated in the Public Finance Management Act, and also goes against the international recommendation of 30–40 percent of revenue.Analysis by the Institute of Economic Affairs shows that in the 2017/18 fiscal year, only 15 countries adhered to the PFM regulation that requires the wage bill to be not more that 35 percent of revenue.The 2019 Economic Survey shows that the Teachers Service Commission receives the lion’s share of the public sector wage payments, increasing from Sh145 billion in 2014 to Sh202 billion in 2018. Wage payments to county governments has doubled from Sh61 billion in 2014 to Sh126 billion in 2018. The push for better salaries and benefits by government employees, and the government’s manifesto to enhance service delivery in key sectors such as health and education only means that the wage bill may continue on an upward trajectory as has been the case in recent years.President Uhuru Kenyatta and National Treasury Cabinet Secretary have called for a reduction of the public wage bill, but this is highly unlikely as previous attempts by the Salaries and Remunerations Commission to lower salaries and benefits of state officers have been met with threats and hostility, and have eventually been reversed by the court, raising questions on how committed the government is in taming the ever growing wage bill.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

IBV affects poultry of all ages and is responsible for more economic loss to the poultry industry than any other infectious disease according to the patent document for the vaccine.Additionally, preliminary scientific studies have not linked the virus’s genetic sequence to birds but to either snakes or mammals.The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus has since been declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a public health emergency.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the new Coronavirus was invented as a vaccine and is part of a human depopulation conspiracy and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

According to Dr Makokha, the first process would be to recreate the virus in a lab and then study it to determine the type of antibodies that the immune system would produce in response to it.The vaccines would then be subjected to animal testing, and once the safety and efficacy is established, the vaccines can advance into clinical trials in humans. If they pass the process and are deemed safe for humans they can then be mass produced for vaccination.ABC News Australia reported on 29 January that Australian scientists had succeeded in growing the 2019-nCoV virus in a lab, which is the first step in the vaccine development process. The scientists are aiming to meet a 16-week deadline to test the coronavirus vaccine on humans.In the meantime, the World Health Organisation called for continued collaboration on studies into the severity and transmissibility of the virus in order to advance scientific understanding of the virus and contribute to the development of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and treatments.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that medics at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology have developed a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, and that six Chinese victims of the disease had been cured with this vaccine and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

646,Maasai Mara VC Walingo has not been cleared of corruption charges,"A tweet claiming that the Office of the Director of Criminal Investigations has cleared Maasai Mara University Vice-Chancellor Prof. Mary Walingo of corruption charges is FALSE.Prof Walingo was implicated in a Sh 190 million graft case at the university, and Citizen TV aired an investigative story on graft at the institution, stating that she ordered the withdrawal of money from the institution’s accounts for personal use.The story implicated four employees at the university involved in a number of dubious cash transactions amounting to over Sh190 million, allegedly acting on the orders of VC Mary Walingo, her driver Abdi Noor, and Anaclet Okumu, a finance officer.The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has however denied that Walingo had been cleared, adding that the claim was an attempt to taint the organization’s image.Prof Walingo was sent on compulsory leave following the expose, and Prof. Kitche Magak was appointed in acting capacity pending completion of the investigation. Speaking to Citizen TV, Prof Magak stated that all those implicated in the scandal, including VC Walingo have been sent on leave but retain their positions at the university as investigations are still ongoing.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Maasai Mara University Vice-Chancellor Mary Walingo has been cleared of corruption charges and finds this to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
647,claims on Kenya’s Diaspora Remittances,"During the 56th Jamhuri Day Celebrations held on December 12, President Uhuru Kenyatta claimed that diaspora remittances grew by 10.9% from Sh 266.19 billion to Sh295.32 billion between June 2018 and June 2019, overtaking earnings from export of tea and coffee as the country’s largest source of foreign exchange.President Kenyatta also highlighted the achievements of his administration in key sectors including education, health and road infrastructure.PesaCheck looked into these claims and found the following:Claim 1: Diaspora remittances grew by 10.9% from Sh266.19 billion to Sh295.32 billion between June 2018 and June 2019.Rating: FalseBasis: Vision 2030 identifies diaspora remittances as one of the factors that can fuel economic growth in the country, and aims to double the amount of cash inflows into the country by creating investment products aimed at Kenyans living in the diaspora.As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs published the Kenya Diaspora Policy in June 2014. The report outlines measures the government will take to engage with Kenyans living in the diaspora, including developing incentives and investment packages to encourage them to direct their remittances towards productive ventures both at the national and county levels.Data from the Central Bank of Kenya shows that Kenyans living and working abroad remitted roughly Sh29.53 billion in June 2019, up from Sh26.62 billion in June 2018, with most of the transfers coming from North America and Europe.Kenya was the third highest recipient of diaspora remittances in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2018. The Migration and Remittances Brief by the World Bank estimates that Kenya received Sh270 billion (USD 2.7 billion) in diaspora remittances, after Ghana and Nigeria which received USD 3.8 billion and USD 24.3 billion respectively.The data corresponds with that contained in the 2018 Kenya Economic Update showing that Kenya’s diaspora remittance inflows stood at approximately Sh280 billion in 2018. Total cumulative inflows between June 2018 and June 2019 stood at Sh255.16 billion.This makes the claim by President Uhuru Kenyatta FALSE.Claim 2: Diaspora remittances overtook earnings from export of tea and coffee as the country’s largest source of foreign exchange.Rating:TrueBasis: Tea, coffee, tourism and horticulture are among Kenya’s largest foreign exchange earners. Kenya earned Sh138.8 billion from tea exports in 2018, with coffee exports raking in Sh23.1 billion.However, diaspora cash inflows are currently the largest source of foreign currency in the country, going by statistics from the Central Bank of Kenya.Diaspora cash inflows have been on the rise in recent years, growing from Sh142.85 billion in 2014 to Sh269.75 billion at the end of 2018. Earnings from tea and coffee exports increased from Sh113.91 billion in 2014 to 161.93 billion in 2018.CBK data shows that in the first half of 2019, Kenyans living abroad sent Sh144.97 billion. However, data on tea and coffee export earnings in 2019 was not publicly available, and the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics was yet to respond to our data request by the time of publishing this article.An analysis of data from the Bureau of Statistics and the Central Bank of Kenya for the last five years shows that diaspora cash inflows have consistently been higher than the joint earnings from tea and coffee exports, thereby making President Kenyatta’s claim TRUE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

649,This post claiming that Kenyans in the UK are demonstrating against Uhuru Kenyatta uses a photo from 2018,"An image shared on Facebook claiming to show Kenyans living in the United Kingdom demonstrating against President Uhuru Kenyatta is MISLEADING.According to the post, the protests were held during the 2020 UK-Africa Summit hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on January 20, 2020, which President Kenyatta attended.A reverse image search shows that the photo was taken in April 2018 after Kenyans living in London held a demonstration against President Uhuru Kenyatta outside Chatham House where he was giving a speech.According to an article by the Daily Nation, the demonstrators were Kenyans living in the United Kingdom protesting against human rights abuses, ignorance of the rule of law and mismanagement of the Kenyan economy by President Kenyatta and his government.The protest in London happened at a time when Kenya was deeply polarized along political lines, and soon after this, ODM leader Raila Odinga was sworn in as the “Peoples President” in a mock ceremony held at Uhuru Park, Nairobi on January 30, 2018.In 2017, a group affiliated to Mr Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party held a similar protest when former Prime Minister Raila Odinga gave a lecture at Chatham House.PesaCheck has looked into an image claiming to show Kenyans living in the United Kingdom demonstrating against President Uhuru Kenyatta and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
650,This page offering motorcycles allegedly from Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is fake,"A Facebook page with a post claiming that Governor Gideon Mbuvi, also known as Mike Sonko, is giving out free motorcycles is FALSE.According to the post, the governor is giving out eight motorbikes on Facebook in response to multiple requests of employment opportunities. In order to receive the bikes, the post asks people to send their personal information, including name, age, identification number, county of residence, specific location, and reason why they should be considered.While both pages have similar display photos on their profiles, Facebook page transparency shows that the page impersonating Sonko was created on November 8, 2019 and has no confirmed page owner, while the genuine one was created on September 21, 2010.Governor Sonko’s official Facebook page has a verified badge while the fake page does not. Additionally, a search on Governor Sonko’s official Facebook page does not reveal any post with information about a motorcycle giveaway.PesaCheck also contacted Nairobi County Director of Operations, Joab Ogolla who dismissed both the claim and the page as fake. He added that the profile name of the Governor’s official page has a period in it and that the page itself has 1.9 million likes. The fake account on the other hand has one thousand likes and its profile name is Governor Mike Sonko (rather than Mike Sonko).In November 2019, police arrested a man impersonating Governor Sonko on Facebook and using the platform to commit fraud, leading the governor to caution the public that any information not sent from his verified Facebook and Twitter accounts is not legitimate.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is giving out free motorbikes and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:

Speaking to PesaCheck on the phone, he stated that there were no reports of a vehicle being set ablaze in Mumias on the day in question.Additionally, there were no media reports of the incident, which would have attracted some attention given the fact that it happened on the day of the BBI forum, and near where the event took place.A reverse image search of the photo that was shared with the post shows it was taken in November 2015 after a bus caught fire when a chef threw a burning gas canister onto a street in China. The photograph is credited to the Chinese News Service, and was republished by a number of publications, including the South China Morning Post and the Daily Mail.The original image shows a building behind the bus with text in Chinese language, part of which has been cropped out in the image shared on Facebook.PesaCheck has looked into a post on Facebook claiming that a school bus heading to Bukhungu Stadium was set on fire and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:
652,This job advert is not from the Kenya Red Cross Society,"A website impersonating the Kenya Red Cross Society and advertising jobs at the organization is FAKE.According to the advert, Red Cross is recruiting 200 people per county to conduct data entry operations as they prepare for a ‘massive recruitment’ to be done at a later date, and that interested job seekers should submit their applications by January 25.The ad asks applicants to pay a registration fee of Sh 370 for their applications to be considered, and those who do not qualify would have their money refunded, a common requirement for previous fake job applications that PesaCheck has looked into.The advert has conflicting information about the job vacancies. It contains branding and information belonging to the Red Cross, but the first line on the website states that the massive recruitment is being done by USAID, and that qualified job applicants would attend a brief interview at the USAID offices.A Whois search shows that the fake website, www.redcrosscareers.com, was registered on January 19, 2020, while the official Kenya Red Cross Website was registered on September 17, 2013.The Kenya Red Cross Society has stated that they are not behind the job advert, and that all vacancies are posted on their website and verified Facebook and Twitter pages.The official Kenya Red Cross website does not contain any of the jobs advertised on the website.PesaCheck has looked into the website impersonating the Kenya Red Cross Society and advertising jobs at the organization and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
653,Viusasa and Skiza platforms have not been banned,"A blog post by Ghetto Radio, a Nairobi based radio station claiming that President Uhuru Kenyatta has banned service providers Viusasa and Skiza is FALSE.The claim was also repeated on Kahawa Tungu, and Hivi Sasa, stating that the platforms will cease operation on the grounds that they operate outside the collection management organizations, which are entities such as Kenya Association of Music Producers (KAMP), Performers Rights Society of Kenya (PRISK), Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK that administer the rights of artists.This claim that these platforms have been banned appears to be a misquote of President Uhuru Kenyatta Jan 14th, 2020 National Address, where he called for the elimination of content service providers who work with digital platforms such as Skiza and Viusasa.Content Service Providers supply media and content to platforms such as Skiza and Viusasa on behalf of the artists and performers who produce this content. Once the content is put on the platforms, it is then accessed and paid for by consumers, and these payments are channeled back to the content producers as royalties.Skiza is a service by Safaricom offering premium callback tunes and music downloads, while Viusasa is a video streaming platform run by Royal Media Services.In his speech, President Kenyatta directed the ICT Ministry to remove conditions requiring digital platforms to only work through licensed Content Service Providers. With this new structure, artists will work with distribution platforms directly instead of going through content service providers, who effectively act as middlemen between the artists and their audiences,The President also directed the digital platforms to be licensed by the Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO) for oversight by the regulator and increased transparency in the collection and distribution of royalties through a single centrally-managed account.According to the president, this would enable oversight by the regulator, and ‘ensure that collection and distribution accounts are easily auditable’.This effectively removes the need for content service providers who have in the past acted on behalf of artists.The President further directed that all rights holders register on the National Rights Registry, a centralized record of content rights-holders to facilitate royalties payments by KECOBO.When contacted by PesaCheck, the companies behind Skiza and Viusasa both confirmed that their platforms had not been banned, and that they had not received any such communication from the regulators. Both platforms remain available and accessible to the public.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Viusasa and Skiza have been banned and finds it to be FALSE.",False:

He appears to suggest that he acted in self-defense, adding that he has received a number of threats to his life.According to the Penal Code section 89(1), anyone who uses a firearm in a way that could cause a disruption in public order is liable for imprisonment for a period of up to fifteen years.In September 2017 the legislator was arrested after he insulted President Uhuru Kenyatta, during a political rally.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Babu Owino has been arrested over a shooting incident at B-Club in Kilimani, Nairobi and finds it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",TRUE:

The site further adds that the deadline for submitting applications is February 22, 2020, and that first time applicants are required to pay Sh 1,500 while those seeking to revise their choices are to pay Sh 1,000.KUCCPS has however stated on its official Twitter and Facebook accounts that it is yet to open applications for KCSE 2019 students, and that this would be done in January 2020. The post on the Admalic website had announced that applications were open in November 2019, which was even before KCSE 2019 results were announced on December 18, 2019.According to the KUCCPS service charter, students are expected to pay Sh 1,500 for the processing of their placement applications. On a phone call with PesaCheck, KUCCPS said that they would provide a paybill number when the portals are opened.KUCCPS warned of fraudulent student placement advertisements, advising that it only announces openings through mainstream media, its official website and Facebook and Twitter accounts.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS) is running advertisements for the placement of KCSE 2019 candidates into institutions of higher learning and finds it to be a HOAX.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",HOAX:

Additionally, there is no record of Obama expressing any desire to run for office in Kenya.The content of the announcement has been shared verbatim on a number of websites, including news-af.feednews.com whose url redirects to Daily Advent Nigeria. A search on the Daily Advent Nigeria website shows that there is no article on Obama’s intent to vie for presidency in Kenya.While Obama’s father, Barack Obama Senior, was a Kenyan citizen, President Obama’s birth certificate which was released to the public in 2011 following controversy over his birthplace shows that he was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, in the US on August 4, 1961, and is therefore a US citizen by birth. According to Article 137 of the Kenyan constitution, he is therefore not eligible to vie for presidency in Kenya because he is not a citizen of Kenya by birth and owes allegiance to a foreign state.Additionally, the Communication Director at the Independent Elections and Boundary Commission (IEBC) Edgar Aswani, told PesaCheck that a presidential candidate must present their valid Kenyan ID and Kenyan passport to the electoral body to prove that one is a Kenyan citizen.Mr Aswani further stated that according to the constitution, the Presidential election in Kenya falls on the second Tuesday of August, 5 years from the last general election.

A reverse image search shows that the photo was taken in February 2016 when the President commissioned the APCs for the Kenya Police Service at G.S.U. Headquarters in Ruaraka.The claim was made in the wake of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, including open military confrontations between the United States and Iran following the killing of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a US drone attack.The attack has led to speculation that tensions arising from Iran’s retaliatory response could affect allies of both countries.However, the Iranian government through its Embassy in Nairobi termed the claim that it would retaliate by targeting other countries as propaganda. Tohid Afzali, who is the Head of the Political Department at the Embassy of Iran in Kenya, told reporters in Nairobi that Tehran would not drag Kenya into its spat with the US, and would maintain diplomatic and bilateral ties.In the meantime, President Uhuru Kenyatta has steered clear of commenting on the issue of Iran or its possible effects to Kenya, avoiding any mention of it in his address to the nation in Mombasa on 14 January, where he outlined his administration’s agenda for the first quarter of 2020.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that President Uhuru Kenyatta has issued a warning to Iran that there would be severe consequences if it attacks any of Kenya’s installations or her allies and finds it to be FALSE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",FALSE:

It contains two different numbers showing how many retweets and likes the tweet has received. The date on the screenshot is formatted as 08 Jan 2020 instead of Jan 8, 2020 as is the standard Twitter format. Additionally, the profile picture on the screenshot is rectangular, whereas Twitter features circular profile photos, or ‘avatars’ as they are more commonly known.The screenshot also does not have a label showing which device and platform was used to post the tweet. On Trump’s verified Twitter account, this would normally show as ‘Twitter for iPhone’.An indication that the tweet was intended to be satirical is the spelling and grammatical errors such as ‘President Mwai Kenyatta’, ‘military covfefe base’, and a reference to the Huduma Namba, a number that would serve as a ‘single source of truth for identifying Kenyans’, and which was the subject of heated debate among Kenyans online.There is no similar tweet on Trump’s verified Twitter account at the time indicated on the timestamp in the screenshot (3:08 PM).

666,ARVs Meant for Kenya Have Not Been Shipped to West Africa,"A Facebook post claiming that antiretroviral drugs meant for Kenya were shipped to a country in West Africa after Kenya Revenue Authority demanded taxes in order to clear them at the port of Mombasa is False.According to the article, the ARVs valued at approximately Kshs 3.5 billion, were shipped to Kenya by the US in partnership with Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA). On arrival at the port of Mombasa, the article alleges that KRA imposed taxes on the medicines, and that which the US embassy refused to pay. As a result, the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) refused to offload resulting in the cargo being shipped back to the US.The article further claimed that the US government then decided to donate the drugs to an undisclosed West African country.This claim was also published by Soko Directory. However, neither of the articles cite any sources for this information, and they also do not demonstrate how they established the authenticity of the claims.Both KRA and the Ministry of Health denied the claim through their social media handles. While KRA said that the story was not factual, MoH further clarified that all health products procured through the President’s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund are tax exempt. ARVs fall under the said category making them free from any taxation.The statement by MOH further explains that KEMSA was in the process of procuring medical products under the PEPFAR funding stream with ongoing shipment from the various vendors expected in the country beginning January 2020.PesaCheck contacted the US Embassy in Kenya and USAID Kenya for further clarification but they are yet to respond.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that KRA demanded tax in order to clear ARVs shipment to Kenya, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

Responding to a tweet by Miguna, Air France indicated that the airline was required to deny boarding Dr. Miguna upon the request by the Kenyan authorities on January 7, 2020.On January 6, 2020, the Government Spokesman stated that Miguna is free to return to the country.On January 6, 2020, Justice Weldon Korir ordered the government to facilitate the entry of Dr. Miguna back to the country, and that the registrar should release Miguna’s Kenyan passport which is currently under custody.“An order be and is hereby issued, that pending and following the inter-partes hearing of the Application, compelling the Respondents to facilitate entry of the Petitioner into Kenya on January 7, 2020 or any other date appointed by the Petitioner on the basis of his identification through the use of his National Identity Card, or his Kenya Passport in the form and state it was delivered by the Respondents to the High Court Registry pursuant to this Court’s Order” — Justice Weldon Korir.In a press statement signed by government spokesperson Colonel Cyrus Oguna on January 8, 2020, the government has indicated that it is ready to comply with the court ruling, but that Dr. Miguna must obtain valid travel documents for him to be allowed in the country.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Dr. Miguna Miguna has been denied entry into Kenya and finds it to be TRUE.",TRUE:

Photos of the event were also published on the Governor’s Facebook page on 22nd December 2017.While the photo used in the Facebook post claiming to show a meeting in 2019 is not among the photos that the Governor shared, both the President and the Governor are wearing similar outfits indicating that it was the same event.The governor and a number of county officials were arrested and charged by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) over misappropriation of county funds and unlawful acquisition of public property at City Hall amounting to Sh 357 million.But they were released on bail on 11 December 2019 with the condition that they would not access their offices until the case was determined. The case is expected to be mentioned on 15th January 2020.Although Sonko has since challenged the ruling barring him from accessing the county offices, which stems from a High Court Ruling on July 24 suspending governors facing graft charges from office for the duration of their cases.

Rather, Pompeo reiterates the partnership between the US and Kenya in the fight against corruption.The US Embassy in Kenya did not immediately respond to queries from PesaCheck but speaking to the media in Siaya County, Ambassador Kyle McCarter said that the US supports the BBI process, stating that his government was keen to have the voice of the people heard.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the US has rejected the BBI process and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

A timestamp on the video suggests that it was recorded on November 28, 2019.The blog post further claims that the lion captured in the CCTV footage could be the stray lion Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) is searching for after its escape from the Nairobi National Park.However, a search on InVid and subsequent reverse image search of key frames in the video shows that it was shot in India’s western state of Gujarat, and the incident was reported by TV9 Gujarati, who indicated that the video was from Dhari, a town in Amreli District. The region is known for its wandering lion population.KWS’s Head of Corporate Communications Ngugi Gecaga did not immediately respond to queries by PesaCheck but is quoted in an article by Nairobi News saying the lion in the video was not in Ongata Rongai as claimed.Since the Tuala incident, KWS has dismissed claims about lions on the prowl in areas adjacent to the Nairobi National Park.

It further stated that the attempt was planned by the political class following his newest song which rattled the corrupt leaders.His new song dubbed ‘Wajinga Nyinyi’ was released on Saturday, December 14, addressed the problems facing the country, linking poor living conditions to the quality of leadership and bad decisions by the electorate.According to the article , the supposed attack occurred at 10:49 pm on 14 December.

These remarks, the letter continues, are deceptive, and have as a result caused damage to the governor’s reputation.Ms Waiguru’s demands are founded on the basis that there were no charges pressed against her by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) in connection to the Sh791 million NYS scandal. It was reported that EACC found no evidence linking the then Devolution CS with the graft scandal.King Kaka’s song title, ‘Wajinga Nyinyi’ translates to ‘You fools’. The song is mostly in Swahili and its lyrics touch on Kenya’s political, economic and social challenges. Some of the topics King Kaka highlights include tribalism, election violence, corruption, poverty and unemployment.He especially questions the quality of Kenya’s leadership in the song, with lyrics calling out corrupt leaders and implying that the country is being led by thieves.The lyrics mentioning Waiguru state that the governor remains in office despite being the cabinet secretary in charge of the Devolution and Planning ministry that the National Youth Service is under.During her term as Devolution CS, a series of scandals were unearthed at the NYS, including one in procurement, where the prices of office supplies, stationery, electronics, and other supplies were heavily inflated. The lyrics specifically mention an instance where pens that would ordinarily retail for Ksh 20 were said to have been bought at Ksh 8,000.The song points out that despite being heavily implicated in the scandals at the ministry, Ms Waiguru was voted in as Kirinyaga County Governor, implying that Kenyans have forgotten the NYS scandal.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Governor Anne Waiguru has ordered King Kaka to take down his ‘Wajinga Nyinyi’ song within 48 hours and apologize for defaming her and finds it to be TRUE.",TRUE:

But because it’s on the move, people think they are many,” KWS’s Head of Corporate Communications Ngugi Gecaga, told PesaCheck.In addition, Gecaga said that the service had not asked residents in areas close to the Nairobi National Park to stay indoors as claimed. An article on the incident published in the Business Daily quotes Sammy Chege, the chairman of a local residents association in the area adjacent to the Nairobi National Park where the lions have been potted, as saying that his association, not KWS as claimed, had asked people in the area to remain indoors between 9am to 5pm to avoid contact with the lions, which mostly roam from sunset to early in the morning.In 2016, Mohawk, a 13-year-old lion, was shot and killed by KWS rangers after he strayed outside the Nairobi National Park and attacked a man in Isinya, 50 kilometers south of the park.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that ten lions are on the loose in residential areas adjacent to the Nairobi National Park, and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

The form states that the deadline for applications is January 17, with interviews scheduled for January 20. Additionally, applicants are required to pay Sh350 shillings as registration fee which will be used to cater for a job ID and uniform.Kenya Airways has cautioned job seekers against applying via the ad stating they are not responsible for it.

689,Meru County collect Sh540 million in the 2018/2019 financial year?,"At a forum in July 2019, Meru County Revenue Board Chief Executive John Ntoiti claimed that the county government had collected Sh540 million in the 2018/2019 financial year, an increase from Sh320 million collected the previous year.Mr Ntoiti attributed to improved efficiency as a result of training of the revenue and enforcement officers in the county government.So the question is, did the Meru County Government collect Sh540 million in the 2018/2019 financial year?PesaCheck has investigated the claim that the Meru County government collected Sh540 million in 2018/2019 and finds it to be MOSTLY TRUE based on the following;The power to raise revenue by both the national and county levels of government is enshrined in chapter 4 of the constitution. Article 175(b) of the Constitution of Kenya states that “county governments shall have reliable sources of revenue to enable them to govern and deliver services effectively.”To generate local revenue, also known as Own-Source Revenue, Article 209(3) of the constitution allows counties to impose property rates, entertainment taxes and any other tax that county governments are authorized to impose by an Act of Parliament.As a result of the persistent shortfall in own-source revenue collection by counties, the National Treasury published a draft National Policy to Support the Enhancement of County Governments Own-Source Revenue in 2017. The policy aims to boost counties capacities to generate their own revenue and reduce reliance on the national government. The counties plan to do this through automating revenue collection using technology, and streamlining their processes to reduce losses and enhance overall revenue collection.Counties total own-source revenue increased year-on-year since 2013 when devolution came into effect, peaking in 2015/2016 to Sh35.02 billion, and declining to Sh32.52 billion in 2016/17 and Sh32.49 billion in 2017/18. Total revenue collection hit a record high in 2018/19 at Sh40.3 billion, which was 74.8% of the annual target of Kshs.53.86 billion. A shortfall in revenues collected means that counties rely on the National Treasury for top-up funds, putting further strain on the public coffers.According to the 2018/19 County Governments Annual Budget Implementation Review Report FY 2018/2019 released by the Office of the Controller of Budget, Meru County’s own-source revenue collection increased by 24.5% from Sh441.69 million raised in FY 2017/18 to Sh550.09 million in 2018/2019.The Controller of Budget reports show that since devolution began in 2013, Meru county has only exceeded its revenue collection targets once in 2017/18.While reading the 2019/2020 budget speech, former National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich said that following a presidential directive in February 2019, the government had established a multi-agency team to facilitate the implementation of an Integrated Revenue Management System for county governments.The Controller of Budget report shows that thirteen counties exceeded their own source revenue collection as a proportion of the annual revenue targets in the year ended June 2019, up from three counties in 2017/18.The data above shows that the claim by Meru County Revenue Board chief executive John Ntoiti that the county government collected Sh540million from own revenue sources in 2018/2019 is understated since the data shows that the amount is Sh550 million.

Additionally, the report does recommend that the office of the Prime Minister should be created.PesaCheck has reviewed the BBI report and finds that there is no recommendation to change the regulations on age limit for any electoral office as provided by the current constitution.According to the Constitution of Kenya (2010), any adult reserves the right to be a candidate for public office.This is cited under the Bill of Rights Chapter 4, Article 38, Section 3, which states that every adult citizen has the right, without unreasonable restrictions, to be registered as a voter, to vote by secret ballot in any election or referendum; and to be a candidate for public office. Furthermore, every adult citizen can hold office within a political party which they are a member of, and, if elected, to hold office, meaning that as long as one is aged 18 and above, they can run for any elected office, including that of the head of state.There have been previous attempts to amend the presidential candidate age limit in 2018, one of which was a petition by Mr Mohamed Mohamud, a resident of Garissa County, to the National Assembly to cap the age of presidential candidates at 70 years.Members of Parliament rejected the petition, on the basis that it violates the non-discrimination stance enshrined in the Constitution.On the matter of the creation of a , the BBI report does recommend that the office of the Prime Minister should be created.The Prime Minister is set to be appointed by the President.

The nominee for Prime Minister shall not assume office until his or her appointment is first confirmed by a resolution of the National Assembly supported by an absolute majority vote of MPs- Building Bridges Initiative Report.The report adds that the Prime Minister will not get an additional salary for this role, and will be the leader of government business in the National Assembly. Contrary to the Facebook post, the report does not state that the Prime Minister will serve for a single seven year term.Jomo Kenyatta served as the country’s first Prime Minister between 1963 and 1964, before the post was abolished after Kenya gained independence.

Key drivers of these changes include the growth of mobile money, government initiatives and support, and developments in information and communications technology (ICT).In 2017 the Brookings Financial and Digital Inclusion project reported that the country has received the highest score on the adoption dimension of the FDIP scorecard, primarily due to its considerable rates of mobile money adoption among low-income adults and women.Based on the 2019 FinAccess Household Survey, the claim by President Kenyatta’s claim is TRUE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

According to Kenya’s Economic Survey 2019, the value of imports from Uganda to Kenya rose to KES49.4 billion in 2018, on account of increased imports of maize, animal feeds, milk and sugar.The data also shows that while Kenya’s exports to Uganda have remained relatively unchanged, Uganda’s exports to Kenya have almost tripled from KES17.5 billion in 2014 to KES49.4 billion in 2018.Trade between the two countries has increased on the back of the East African Common Market Protocol which was signed in 2010, and which allows the free movement of goods, people, labour, services and capital from one partner state to another.Claim 1: Uganda imported goods worth $700 million from Kenya six years agoVerdict: FALSEBasis:Data from Bank of Uganda shows that Uganda imported goods worth USD589.01 from Kenya, which is less than General Katureebe’s claim of USD 700 million. The data shows that the value of imports from Kenya decreased between 2011 and 2013 from USD 657 million in 2011 to USD 608 million in 2012, further decreasing to USD 589 million in 2013.According to the World Bank, the value of imports from Kenya to Uganda decreased from USD 644.574 million in 2011 to USD 590.164 million in 2012, further decreasing to USD 562.819 Million in 2013. The data shows that consumer goods topped the list of imports from Kenya, valued at USD 297.4 million.Both sources of data show that General Katureebe overstated Uganda’s imports from Kenya in 2013, thereby making his claim FALSE.Claim 2: Kenya imported goods worth $150 million from Uganda six years agoVerdict: FALSEBasis: According to the Bank of Uganda, Uganda’s export earnings from Kenya have been on an upward trend, increasing from USD 298 million in 2011 to USD 383.8 million in 2013 to USD 523 million in 2015. Data from Kenya’s Bureau of Statistics also shows that Uganda was Kenya’s largest export destination among the East African Community states, importing lime, cement and construction materials from Kenya.According to the World Bank, Uganda’s exports to Kenya increased from USD226.58 million in 2011 to USD254.06 million in 2012 to USD 314.43 million in 2013.This means that Kenya’s imports from Uganda in 2013 were more than double General Katureebe’s claim of USD 150 million, making his claim FALSE.Claim 3: Today the balance of trade is more or less equal with Uganda importing goods worth $600 million from Kenya while Kenya imports goods worth about $500 million from Uganda.Verdict: FALSEBasis: According to the Bank of Uganda, Uganda imported goods worth USD720.13 million from Kenya in the twelve months to June 2019, up from USD 513.81 million in 2017/18. The data also shows that Kenya’s import bill from Uganda surpassed the USD 600 million mark in 2017/18 to stand at USD 678.47 million. This however decreased to USD 433.79 million in 2018/19.The above figures show that Kenya’s exports to Uganda were valued at USD 720 million in the year to June 2019, while imports were valued at USD 433 million during the period. This contradicts General Katureebe’s claim that Uganda’s imports to Kenya are worth $600 million while Kenya’s imports to Uganda are valued at $500 million from Uganda, making it FALSE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

772,This photo does not show a Kenyan businessman injured in xenophobic violence in South Africa,"A Facebook post claiming to show a Kenyan who was attacked and who lost his family in the September 2019 xenophobic attacks in South Africa is FALSE.According to the post, the man in the photo is Njoroge Gathiru from Muranga County, and he had apparently been brutalised, his wife raped and his children murdered in the ongoing attacks, in addition to having his mall looted. The post also adds that Kenya’s foreign ministry has not issued a statement regarding the matter.However, a reverse image search shows that the photo used in the post is actually of Christopher Haambote, a Zambian farmer who was injured during political protests in Lusaka in 2017.The image was published on June 24, 2017, by Zambian Watchdog, and it shows the aftermath of after a clash between the supporters of two political parties — the United Party for National Development (UPND) and the Patriotic Front in Zambia.The photo was also shared by The Mast on June 24, 2017 and the Zambian Observer on July 4, 2017.Contrary to what the post claims, the High Commission of Kenya in Pretoria issued a statement highlighting the potential dangers of false information about the ongoing xenophobic attacks in South Africa currently in circulation.The High Commission has stated that some of the clips claiming to show the ongoing situation are likely to cause panic, but some of them are outdated, while others are not even from South Africa.The High Commission has advised Kenyans to exercise caution and seek clarification before circulating any information on the attacks, and assuring Kenyans in South Africa that all measures were being put in place to ensure their safety and the protection of their property.In a post shared on Twitter by Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Ambassador Monica Juma, regarding the attacks, two Kenyans have been affected and their property destroyed. This was corroborated by the Kenya Diaspora in South Africa (KEDASA) Association.CS Juma added that the government was in touch with Kenya’s High Commission in South Africa, and was working to ensure the safety of Kenyans living there as well as their property.The South African government has strongly condemned the ongoing xenophobic attacks, calling on security forces to arrest the perpetrators in a bid to curb the violence.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that a photo shared on Facebook shows a Kenyan who was attacked in xenophobic violence in South Africa and finds it to be FALSE.A previous version of this article indicated that the person identified in the photo is Zambian Member of Parliament Charles Zulu.

773,These photos of a network mast on fire in Nigeria are not from 2019,"Photos published on Facebook purported to be of a fire set by Nigerians on a MTN network mast to retaliate xenophobic attacks on Nigerian citizens in South Africa are FALSE.The post and its accompanying photos allege that the MTN mast was set on fire due to MTN’s South African ownership, and it was shared after reports emerged of Nigerians and other foreigners being attacked in South Africa.However, a reverse image search reveals that the photos in the post are from a 2015 fire in Akwa Ibom in Nigeria, not in 2019 as the post claims.MTN is a South African mobile telecommunications company with a presence in 21 African countries, including Nigeria where it is the largest mobile operator.Following the recent wave of xenophobic attacks targetting foreigners in South Africa, a number of retaliatory attacks have been reported in Nigeria, including one on an MTN shop in Ibadan that was vandalized. MTN Nigeria temporarily closed all its outlets in the country as a precautionary measure.In a statement announcing the closure, MTN Nigeria confirmed that the company’s facilities, customers and stakeholders had been the subject of attacks in retaliation for the ongoing xenophobic situation in South Africa, and the attacks had been reported in Lagos, Ibadan and Uyo.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that a photo of a burning MTN mast in Nigeria is from 2019 and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

Justice Odunga termed the clause discriminatory, saying that it is unfair for capital offenders to be denied the right to have their sentences reduced due to good behaviour, ill-health, or on other special grounds.The post further adds that this was based on the assumption that those found guilty of capital offences were incapable of reform.In his ruling at the Machakos Law Courts, Justice Odunga declared Section 46 of the Prisons Act, which condemned capital offenders to serve their sentences in full unconstitutional.Justice Odunga argued that the dignity of a prisoner is ignored if he is denied remission that is available to others serving similar sentences, simply on the irrational presumption that he is incapable of reforming.The case had been filed by five persons convicted of robbery with violence serving sentences ranging from 15 to 40 years. The five challenged a section of the Prisons Act saying that it contravenes Article 27 of the constitution, which guarantees equality and freedom from discrimination.The five argued that since remission is not granted to prisoners sentenced for life or for an offence under section 296(2) of the Penal Code, capital offenders are treated unequally.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that long-serving capital offenders can now be released after serving two-thirds of their jail terms and finds it to be TRUE.",TRUE:

793,The World Bank did not withdraw from the James Gichuru-Rironi Road project over inflated costs,"An article published by the Kenyan Bulletin, an online publication, claiming that World Bank has withdrawn from funding James Gichuru — Rironi Road project is a MIXTURE.According to the article, the World Bank ‘bolted out’ of the project because of the inflated price by the government.While it is true that World Bank withdrew from the James Gichuru-Rironi road project, the withdrawal was due to a request by the National Treasury to cancel the project, and not because of inflated costs as alleged in the article.According to the World Bank, the construction of the James Gichuru-Rironi road was to be implemented as part of the National Urban Transport Improvement Project (NUTIP). The project was cancelled in December 2018 upon request by the National Treasury.While the World Bank had approved the James Gichuru-Rironi Road project in September 2012, the government opted to reallocate funds meant for this project to other more promising projects, which the World Bank has attributed to the slow pace of implementation.It is standard practice for the government and the World Bank to review the performance of projects which can sometimes result in partial cancellations and restructurings as we respond to changing priorities and developments on the ground, Vera Rosauer, the World Bank’s Communication Officer for the Africa region, told PesaCheck via email.According to the National Urban Transport Improvement Project implementation report, the delay in implementation of major contracts such as the James Gichuru — Rironi road project among others was caused by the change from a centralised system to a devolved system of government in Kenya, leading to gaps in financing, project design, and implementation of proposed activities that could not be accomodated.The document further shows that the improvement of James Gichuru-Rironi road project was still in progress as at March 15, 2019, and has been listed under ongoing road projects by Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) with progress at 18 percent.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that World Bank bolted out from funding James Gichuru-Rironi Road project and finds it to be a MIXTURE.",MIXTURE:

801,much do we share online?,"By Musembi MutisyaFaceApp, the app that can transform photos of its users’ faces to show them what they might look like when they’re much older or younger, has been in the headlines not just because of the millions of users posting dramatically transformed photos of themselves, but due to the implications of letting a company own the likenesses of those using its service.Once downloaded, the app lets you take a picture of yourself and see what you could look like in a variety of circumstances.However, the app’s privacy policy raises a number of issues, among them the fact that it asks for unlimited access to one’s photo library, which includes pulling location data, IP addresses, log file information, and other potentially sensitive information.This situation, whether by deliberate design or oversight, presents multiple red flags, as this information can be mined, manipulated, bought, or sold is as the privacy policy is minimally regulated.Both legal and regulatory controls lag far behind the pace of technology. Recent revelations over how Cambridge Analytica harvested Facebook user data and used this data for targeted advertising without the knowledge or consent of the people being targeted shows the implications of unregulated data collection.FaceApp has put it clear that the app will pull data for the purpose of aiming targeted ads. Certain information such as cookie data can be shared with third-party advertising partners, which appears similar to the terms and conditions for apps and services like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.Privacy invasions often sneak in through ‘fun’ apps. CA, for example, got all the data it needed using peculiar personality quizzes, and used this data for election interference, raising concerns over how else such data collected through social media platforms can be exploited, and what other vulnerabilities exist.While the underlying technology around facial recognition is finding a variety of uses, such as unlocking and logging in to phones and banking apps, by immigration authorities at points of entry, these images could potentially be used to make ‘deep fakes’, which use AI to create stunningly realistic videos of a person using images of their face.This has unfortunate implications for celebrities, for example, who have had their faces spliced into pornographic videos. Additionally, facial recognition tech is being increasingly used by governments looking to monitor citizens.So laws and regulation need to be tuned up quickly — and not just because of FaceApp. While FaceApp is not the only photo-editing app with weak privacy protections, apps like Snapchat and Instagram apps allow users to submit their own photos and apply an AI-powered filter to transform their image. The companies behind these apps need to do better to protect the privacy of their users.Part of this is simply making users more aware of how their data could be used. This is the rationale behind privacy policies, though, many users don’t read those policies before signing up.Developers need to build actual privacy protections into their apps that can include notifications on how data are being used, policies on data retention and deletion, and for users to request data correction and deletion. Additionally, the app providers and platforms should build in more safeguards for third-party apps.Facial recognition is only one aspect highlighting the need for more robust data protection laws, especially given the sheer amount of data collected on individuals especially in the as big data becomes ubiquitous.The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) doesn’t apply when your data is used by AI and machine-learning systems, or when your face is added to a facial-recognition data-set without your knowledge.",How

807,Eating ugali has not been directly linked to cervical cancer,"An article published by Parents Africa Magazine titled: “Ugali linked to cervical cancer” has a FALSE HEADLINE.The article that has been queued as potentially false, purports that eating ugali has been linked to cancer, specifically cervical cancer in women.The article cites research carried out on women at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in a paper titled “Detection and concentration of plasma aflatoxin is associated with detection of oncogenic human papillomavirus in Kenyan women” published in the Open Forum Infectious Diseases (OFID) Journal.According to the paper, chronic ingestion of aflatoxin in food products increases the risk of cervical cancer among women. While high levels of aflatoxin have been linked to cancer of the liver, but there is limited data on the effects of aflatoxin on other human cancers.Aflatoxin is a poison produced by the Aspergillus fungus, and it affects cereals, nuts, and other dry foods during storage or in the field. Aflatoxin poisoning is a food safety and security issue, particularly for people living in developing countries with temperate and tropical climates. Aflatoxins occur when food is poorly stored, and pose a serious health threat to humans and livestock.Dietary aflatoxin is a potent carcinogen, and the study identifies contaminated maize meal — the main ingredient in ugali — as well as contaminated sorghum, millet, groundnuts and milk, as the most likely sources. Repeated exposure to dietary aflatoxin also has the potential to weaken the immune system, leaving the body less able to destroy cancer cells.The study states that consuming contaminated corn products, could be a contributing factor to the rising cases of cervical cancer among women in the country. Research on cervical cancer shows that Human Papillomavirus infection is also a contributing factor in causing cervical cancer.However, the study worked with a small sample of 86 women, and out these, 49, or 57 per cent, tested positive for aflatoxin. The prevalence of HPV was found to be high among the women who also tested positive for aflatoxin, but this alone is not conclusive enough for a definitive link to be made between the two.Aflatoxins are likely to be a cofactor in addition to the human papillomavirus (HPV), making infection more likely to lead to cancer. While most women with HPV don’t automatically develop cervical cancer, risk factors such as smoking and HIV infection increases the risk of developing cancer among women exposed to the virus.However, no definitive link has been established between HPV and consuming food with aflatoxins.PesaCheck has looked into the article linking Ugali consumption with cervical cancer among women in Kenya and finds that it has a FALSE HEADLINE.",MISLEADING:

When this happens, the brain’s oxygen and nutrient supply is cut off, causing damage to brain tissue.The post claims that pricking all the victim’s fingers and letting them blead would lead to unconscious stroke victims regaining consciousness.However, KTN’s Dr. Mercy Korir, Dr. Dilraj Singh Sokhi of the Aga Khan hospital says that if someone suffers a stroke, the best way to save their lives, is to rush them to a nearby hospital or seek for medical assistance.Dr Steven Novella, a clinical neurologist and assistant professor at Yale University School of Medicine, has spoken against the finger pricking of stroke victims, stating that it has the potential of hindering true treatment.This is further supported by Dr. Kathleen Burger from the American Heart and Stroke Association, who says that every minute that goes by without treatment for stroke victims could lead to millions of brain cells dying, and there’s no way to get those brain cells back.Therefore, pricking the fingers of someone suffering from a stroke first rather than getting them to a medical facility for treatment wastes precious time, and does not have any proven beneficial effect.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that pricking the fingers of stroke victims can help save their lives and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

Serianu Chief Executive Officer William Makatiani explained that the information in the report was obtained from the Banking Fraud unit, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the National Intelligence Service.According to the report, which was published by a cybersecurity firm Serianu, the most affected industries were SACCOs, government entities, banking institutions, betting firms and financial service integrators.Of the Sh29.5 billion lost, Sh8.85 billion was from direct costs, while Sh20.65 billion was lost indirectly. The costs were incurred as a result of computer compromise, email and phishing scams, attacks on transaction channels, and identity theft. The report also adds that less than a third (29%) of the total amount lost was recovered.Governments are particularly susceptible to cyber attacks, as happened on June 3, 2019 when 18 government of Kenya websites were defaced by a group of hackers known as the KURD Electronic Team.The websites were taken offline, and remained unavailable to anyone looking to access information or government services through them. While access to the websites was eventually restored by a team from the Information Communications and Technology Authority, it highlights the need for a proper cybersecurity policy and response strategy.The report attributes the attacks to malicious software, made worse by lax cybersecurity measures.

843,the 2019 State of Devolution Address in Kenya,"On June 28, 2019, Council of Governors chairperson, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya delivered the sixth State of Devolution Address in Nairobi. During the address, Oparanya, who is the Governor of Kakamega County, highlighted the achievements of devolution in ten key sectors, and addressed a number of challenges that the devolved governments continue to encounter six years since the devolved system of governance came into effect.PesaCheck looked into 7 claims made by Governor Oparanya and rated them as follows:Claim 1: Since 2013, County Governments have cumulatively received 1.57 trillion shillings in equitable share of revenue.Rating: PLAUSIBLEBasis: The Constitution of Kenya provides for the equitable sharing of national revenue. Article 202, which is under Chapter twelve of the Constitution provides that:County governments may be given additional allocations from the national government’s share of the revenue, either conditionally or unconditionally.The most recent County Governments Budget Implementation Review Report published by the Office of the Controller of Budget in February 2019 shows that Sh224.65 billion was available to counties in the first half of 2018/19, of which Sh115.14 billion was equitable share of revenue.The data above shows that between July 2013 and December 2018, counties had received a total of Sh1.36 trillion from the National Government as equitable share of revenue. According to the Controller of Budget’s report for the first nine months of 2018/19, counties received Sh200.89 trillion from the national government as equitable share and conditional grants to level 5 hospitals.The 2012/13 fourth quarter report by the Controller of Budget shows that county governments received a grant of Sh9.66 billion from the national government, in line with the Transition County Appropriation Act of 2013.A statement issued by the National Treasury in July 2018 shows that between 2013/14 and 2017/18, the national government had transferred a total of Sh1.26 trillion to counties as equitable share of revenue.The Quarterly Economic and Budgetary Review (QEBR) published in May 2019 shows that as at March 31, 2019, the national government had disbursed Sh212.39 billion to counties for the 2018/19 fiscal year. However, the National Treasury does not indicate if the disbursements are equitable share of revenue, or if they include conditional allocations.According to the Statement of Actual Revenues and Net exchequer Issues published by the National Treasury in the Gazette Notice №5429 dated June 21, 2019, county governments had received a total of Sh263.35 billion shillings for the fiscal year 2018/2019 as at May 31, 2019.The gazette notices published in the month of July for the years 2014 — 2018 show that the government had released a total of Sh1.29 trillion to the counties. This means that the national government has disbursed a total of Sh1.55 trillion to counties between July 2013 and May 2019.As with the data published in the QEBR, it is not clear if the disbursements only show the equitable share of revenue, or include the conditional allocations to counties. This makes Oparanya’s claim PLAUSIBLE. — Ann NgengereClaim 2: Since 2013, counties’ equitable share of revenue has translated to only 20% of the 7.8 trillion shillings in total revenue collected nationally.Rating: FALSEBasis: The promulgation of the new Constitution in 2010 led to the introduction of 47 county governments after the March 2013 general election. Article 174 of the Constitution outlines one of the objectives of devolution as ‘equitable sharing of national and local resources in the country.’ Clause 1 of Article 218 of the Constitution gives guidelines on the division of revenue between national and county governments, and the allocation of revenue between the 47 counties. The clause states:At least two months before the end of each financial year, there shall be introduced in Parliament — (a) A Division of Revenue Bill, which shall divide revenue raised by the national government among the national and county levels of government in accordance with this Constitution; and(b) A County Allocation of Revenue Bill, which shall divide among the counties the revenue allocated to the county level of government on the basis determined in accordance with the resolution in force under Article 217.Additionally, Clause 2 of Article 203 gives the formula for how revenue raised nationally should be shared between the two levels of government.Article 203 reads in part:For every financial year, the equitable share of the revenue raised nationally that is allocated to county governments shall be not less than fifteen per cent of all revenue collected by the national government.The amount referred to in clause (2) shall be calculated on the basis of the most recent audited accounts of revenue received, as approved by the National Assembly.A look at the Division of Revenue Act of 2013 and the Division of Revenue Amendment Act of 2018 shows that total shareable revenue increased from Sh920.38 billion in 2013/14 to Sh1.69 trillion shillings in 2018/19.The total shareable revenue since the onset of devolution in the 2013/14 financial year to the just concluded 2018/19 financial year was 7.54 trillion, which is Sh260 billion less than Gov. Oparanya’s claim of Sh7.8 trillion, making his claim FALSE. — Ann NgengereClaim 3 : County Governments have made significant improvement in the absorption of funds now averaging 75% of the allocations in the year under review.Rating: PLAUSIBLEBasis: The budget implementation reports published by the Office of the Controller of Budget show that the absorption rate of the total annual counties budgets was as follows:As shown in the data above, the absorption of county budgets averaged 68% as at December 2018. Since the data showing the absorption rate for 2019 is yet to be published, we rate Governor Oparanya’s claim that the absorption of funds is now at an average of 75 percent PLAUSIBLE. -Ann NgengereClaim 4: The average development allocation by counties over the last six financial years has been 40% surpassing the legal requirement of at least 30%.Rating: TRUEBasis: Section 107 of the Public Financial Management Act of 2012 requires that counties allocate at least 30 percent of their annual budgets for development expenditure.A look at the numbers in the CoB reports shows that since devolution came into effect in 2013, counties have allocated an average of 40.02 percent of their budgets for development purposes, thereby making Oparanya’s claim TRUE.- Ann NgengereClaim 1: Water [services] coverage has now increased to 57%.Rating: TRUEBasis: Provision of water has been devolved to the counties based on the Water Act of 2016, which states that county governments have the mandate to manage the Water Service Providers that fall under their jurisdiction.According to the 2017/2018 Performance report from the Water Services Regulatory Board, access to water services in Kenya is currently at 57% which is a 2% improvement from the previous year.However, they note that the improvement falls short of the required 4% annual growth rate that is required to reach Kenya’s Vision 2030 goal of universal access to water. This makes Gov. Oparanya’s claim that water coverage has increased to 57% TRUE.- Soila KenyaClaim 2: Sanitation coverage is now at 16%Rating: TRUEBasis: According to Pascaline Wanjiku, a Water Supply and Sanitation Specialist at the World Bank, Kenya did not achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for increasing access to water and sanitation.“Only 30% of Kenyans have access to improved sanitation, that is, the use of sanitation facilities that hygienically separate excreta from human contact. This means that approximately 30 million Kenyans are still using unsafe sanitation methods like rudimentary types of latrines, and almost six million are defecating in the open,” her article published in February 2018 reads.The article also states that access to improved sanitation in Kenya increased by only 5% between 1990 and 2015.The 2017/2018 Performance report from the Water Services Regulatory Board shows that sewered sanitation coverage is at 16%.This makes Gov. Oparanya’s claim that sanitation coverage is now at 16% TRUE.-Soila KenyaClaim 3: Non-revenue water is now at 41%Rating: TRUEBasis: Non-revenue water is water that has been pumped and then lost or unaccounted for. When water is being transported from water utilities to community distribution points, any instance of spillage, theft or metering inaccuracies incurs a financial loss on the part of the water utilities.The 2017/2018 Performance report from the Water Services Regulatory Board shows that Kenya’s levels of non-revenue water are at 41% for the 2017/2018 year.They warn that these levels are unsustainable with the existing demand and that the level needs to drop to 25% or increase water production by two and a half times the current level in order to meet demand. This makes Gov. Oparanya’s claim that non-revenue water is now at 41% TRUE.- Soila KenyaDo you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

844,Kenya Women Microfinance Bank Is Not Taking Loan Applications Through An Online Form,"A post shared on Facebook claiming that the Kenya Women Microfinance Bank is offering loans to prospective clients via an online form, and that the loan applications will be processed in 30 minutes is a HOAX.The post that has been shared over 30 times, asks clients to apply for loans through an online form that takes one to womenyouthbusinessfund.info. The site’s banner text reads ‘KWFT LOANS: APPLY FOR ONLINE LOANS’, and it does not contain any recognizable branding.When one clicks on the ‘Apply’ button, they are taken to an online form, where a number of criteria are listed, including that one needs to have used mobile money services such as MPesa and Airtel Money for more than 3 months, and that the minimum and maximum amounts anyone can borrow are KSh 2,000 and KSh 300,000 respectively.One requirement that appears rather suspicious is that first time applicants need to pay a fee of KSh 390 that would be refunded if the application was unsuccessful. The fee is not sent to a Paybill number, but to a personal number.A look at the WHOIS information of the womenyouthbusinessfund.info website shows that its hosting information is hidden, which means that it is impossible to determine who the registered owner of the domain is. The site was registered in 2018, while the WHOIS information for kwftbank.com, the official site of the Kenya Women Microfinance Bank website, shows that the domain was registered in 2014.The Kenya Women Microfinance Bank, formerly known as Kenya Women Finance Trust, was founded in 1981 to address the financial needs of women.The bank offers different loan facilities to its clients. A client is required to make a loan application form at a physical branch of the bank.In a written statement published on July 8 on the Kenya Women Holding (KWH) Facebook page, members of the public have been advised to ignore the post claiming that they can apply for loans at KWFT and get approval within 30 minutes.

Kariobangi Sharks wore an all white strip for the match against Everton, and their kit is manufactured by Umbro, while Everton wore their traditional white and blue kit.A scrutiny of the DP’s Twitter handle also shows that he shared pictures of the Harambee Stars vs Ethiopia match together with Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Nairobi governor Mike Sonko.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that DP Ruto attended the July 7 International SportPesa friendly match pitting Kariobangi Sharks and Everton and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:

851,the Women Enterprise Fund Disbursed Sh42 billion in Four Years?,"Speaking during the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (Kepsa) Suppliers Diversity Summit on May 29, 2019, Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs Professor Margaret Kobia, claimed that women-owned businesses have accessed Sh42 billion from the Women Enterprise Fund in the last four years.CS Kobia added that only a tenth of the Sh250 billion set aside for marginalized groups under the Access to Government Procurement Opportunities Programme (AGPO) has been taken up since the programme was rolled out.The Women Enterprise Fund was launched in 2007 as a semi-autonomous government agency in the Ministry of Public Service, Youth & Gender Affairs, with the main aim of providing capital to women to start and run their businesses.So the question is, did women-led businesses enjoy access to Sh42 billion from the Women Enterprise Fund in the past four years?PesaCheck has investigated the claim by CS Margaret Kobia that women-owned businesses enjoyed access to Sh42 billion from the Women Enterprise Fund in the past four years and finds it to be FALSE based on the following;The Women Enterprise Fund was launched through the Government Financial Management Regulations of 2007 under Legal Notice 147. The fund was set up with the aim of providing loans to women-oriented micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and is one of the projects under the social pillar of Vision 2030.The Fund has 4 lending channels which are the Constituency Women Enterprise Scheme (CWES) which consists of interest-free group lending, Local Purchase Order (LPO) financing which helps women entrepreneurs to meet tender conditions and supply goods and services, Financial Intermediaries (FIs) who provide subsidised credit and SACCO lending.According to a report published by the Office of the Auditor General in March 2018, the funds disbursed between 2007/2008 when the fund was launched and 2016/2017 amounted to Sh9.36 billion.Data published on the Women Enterprise Fund website shows that the fund had disbursed a total of Sh15.4 billion as of April 30, 2019. The Constituency Women Enterprise Scheme (CWES) Summary Report, 2019 breaks down the disbursements as shown below:The report shows that as at April 30, 2019, a total of 97,087 groups with 1,459,105 members had accessed credit through the fund since it was established. It also shows that the total amount disbursed through the Constituency Women Enterprise Scheme was Sh13.45 billion. Even after the addition of funds disbursed through financial intermediaries and SACCOs, the amount of funds disbursed since the inception of the fund is less than half the amount claimed by CS Kobia in May 2019.This makes the claim by CS Margaret Kobia that women-owned businesses have had access to Sh42 billion from the Women Enterprise Fund over the last four years FALSE.EDITOR’S NOTEAccording to a statement issued by Ministry of Youth, Public Service and Gender Affairs on July 9, the Women Enterprise Fund had disbursed Sh15.4 billion as of June 2019, not Sh42 billion as previously stated in the Daily Nation article in May 2019.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

852,Kenya able to deal with the growing number of online threats?,"By Musembi MutisyaOn June 3, several websites belonging to various government agencies and departments were defaced by Indonesian hackers leaving key services inaccessible. Though the ICT Authority recovered the sites, the question on how vulnerable we are to online threats still remains.This is not the first time the government sites have been infiltrated by attackers. In January 2017, the Communications Authority, which is the regulatory body mandated with developing the information and communication sectors in the country, was hacked.Ironically, the Communication Authority (CA) is responsible for facilitating the development and management of a national cyber security framework as outlined in the Kenya Information and Communications Act.Additionally, the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act, 2018 is meant to ensure the security of data from cyber criminals. All these laws are meant to prevent computer-related offences, such as unauthorized interference, unauthorized access, cyber-espionage and phishing attacks. The Acts provide a framework for ensuring that the state is able to deal with attacks against critical information infrastructure. However, what is clear is that despite having these regulations in place, we are still vulnerable to cyber attacks.Statistics for October-December 2018 shared by CA show an increase in the number of threat events in Kenya, with over 10.2 million events detected compared to 3.8 million in the previous year. These events vary from Denial-of-Service (DOS) attacks — which make services unavailable online — as well as phishing and online abuse, cyber fraud, hate speech, incitement and disinformation.The Kenya Cyber Security Report 2018 by cyber security firm Serianu shows that cyber crimes are on the rise, with an estimated $295 million lost both directly and indirectly. The financial sector was most affected, with attacks targeting SACCOs, banks and betting firms.This is part of a global trend, where the number of cyber-related threats has gone up, including malware and the use of stolen personal data and credentials, as well as fake mobile applications hosted online that defraud unsuspecting users.Kenya was ranked third in Africa in 2017, and 45th among 144 counties surveyed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index for its preparedness and ability to fight cybercrime. The country does have frameworks and policies in place, which imply that the country has the capacity, but are these policies ever implemented? Does the country have the technical capacity?Given the volume of critical data that the government is collecting with the aim of streamlining service delivery, how secure is this data, which includes biometrics, physical addresses and phone numbers? Though sites affected are already up, there is a need for robust data protection measures to be put in place, considering the potential damage that any breach of this database could cause.Cyber crimes have become increasingly high profile, particular those around hacking. These are also problems associated with privacy and confidentiality of information and its disclosure, whether lawfully or otherwise.These recent attacks show that there are gaps in Kenya’s policy framework, which is what determines the structures put in place to ensure preparedness in the event of attacks such as those carried out on June 3.There is also a need for trained experts in cybersecurity, and more cooperation between developed and developing countries to minimize the incidents of cyber attacks.In order to secure Kenya’s online space, it is necessary for all the parties involved — both government and the private sector — to come together and ensure that the structures put in place are operational and fully functional, and that any threats are quickly handled once they are identified. That way, we can ensure that any attacks against critical information infrastructure will not disrupt the delivery of key services, and the information coursing through these systems is also kept safe.Musembi Mutisya is an Open Data expert and industry analyst.",Is
853,HEADLINE: A mass deportation directive in the US does not specifically target undocumented Kenyans,"An article published online with the title “Alarm — Undocumented Kenyans in the US in trouble as Trump announces mass deportation plot,” has a FALSE HEADLINE.The headline of the article, which has been queued as potentially false, insinuates that the intended mass deportation exercise by the US government targets illegal immigrants of Kenyan origin, which is false.On June 18, President Donald Trump said that his administration would begin the process of removing ‘millions of undocumented immigrants’ from the country.However, On June 22, president Trump announced that he would postpone the mass deportation exercise for two weeks as he seeks compromise with leaders of the Democratic party.Illegal immigration is a central issue for President Trump’s administration, and he has made a number of executive orders on the issue, including a ban on immigration from six Muslim-majority countries, and increased funding for a proposed wall on the US-Mexico border.The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Mark Morgan in a televised interview said that the raids that Trump have been planned long even before the president mentioned it publicly.

889,Huduma Number — Digital Identity and Inclusion in Kenya,"By Musembi MutisyaOn April 2, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched a countrywide registration exercise for the National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS), dubbed Huduma Namba. The number, meant to serve as a unique identifier, is anchored through Executive Order №1 (2018), and The State Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2018, Section 9A.The underlying rationale for this registration exercise is to enable the government to capture data of all persons residing in Kenya, as well as Kenyans living abroad with the primary aim of improving access to government services.However, the registration exercise was plagued by several challenges since its pilot phase was rolled out in February 2019. For starters, there have been a number of instances of misinformation circulating on social media platforms.The unorthodox manner in which the system was introduced is quite interesting. It was done through a Miscellaneous Amendment Act, which has traditionally been the reserve of minor amendments to the law. The collection of a person’s information, especially personal data warrants constitutional checks, including civic education and public participation as stipulated in the constitution.The government set aside an estimated Sh6 billion for the Huduma Namba initiative, with Sh1.7 billion used to procure the biometric kits. Little is known on how IDEMIA, formerly OT- Morpho, was awarded the tender to provide the registration gadgets. The firm has changed its name thrice in five years, having first supplied Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) kits as Safran Morpho in the March 2013 elections, and as OT- Morpho in the 2017 elections, before taking on their current identity.According to the Public Accounts Committee, the firm has been operating illegally since it is not registered and does not have a local representation as stipulated in the Kenyan Companies Act.Moreover, during the registration period, there was no public list of mapped out registration centres, meaning it was unclear where exactly people would be registered. Additionally, some individuals were registered at home, while others had to queue at these registration areas, wherever they happened to be.After a one-week extension, the mass registration deadline came to a close on May 25, with the government announcing that those who did not register by then would have to go to an Assistant Chief’s office within their locality to do so. It is unclear where Kenyans in the diaspora can register when their deadline lapses as well.The government ended the registration period on May 25, in direct contravention of a court order which ruled against making the registration exercise mandatory as well as having a deadline. During the registration exercise, some government officials gave misleading information on the repercussions of failing failure to register for the Huduma Namba.It is evident that the government did not engage the public enough on this exercise that has been widely misunderstood by many citizens. This contravenes the Access to Information Act, which compels the government to the disclosure of information / relevant facts while formulating important policies touching on its citizens.Kenya does not have a watertight legal framework that guarantees the protection of its citizens’ private data and ensures that there is no unjustified violation of their privacy. Given the fact that the government intends to hold this collected personal information and share it within its different entities, questions arise on how secure this data will be, and whether there could be an invasion of privacy.The Data Protection Bill which was approved by the cabinet on April 18, 2019, needs to be expedited and signed into law to ensure that the country has strong protections in place to safeguard Kenyans’ personal information, and which will aid in holding the government and other data collectors accountable in the event of a breach of privacy in line with article 31 C of the Constitution.Musembi Mutisya is an Open Data expert and industry analyst.",The

891,Kenya’s government announced plans to demonetize the 1000 shilling note,"An article by Prime News Kenya claiming that Kenyans should take their old generation 1000 shilling notes to banks by October 1 is TRUE.The, article which has been flagged as potentially false, adds that the note will be withdrawn from circulation because it is used to conduct illicit financial transactions in Kenya and other countries in the region.Central Bank of Kenya Governor, Dr. Patrick Njoroge, launched the new generation banknotes during the Madaraka Day celebrations in Narok on June 1. In his address to the public, the CBK governor said that Kenyans will be required to trade in their old generation 1000 shilling notes for the new generation notes by October 1, as per a special gazette notice dated May 31, 2019.This move, he said, is necessary to curb illicit financial transactions conducted using the currency, and stop the circulation of 1000 shilling counterfeit notes in the country and the region at large. According to the Central Bank of Kenya, the old Sh1000 note will not be used as legal tender effective October 1, 2019.The Central Bank estimates that there are currently 217.6 million pieces of the Sh 1000 note in circulation.The regulator says that the design of the new generation currency is in line with Article 231 (4) of the constitution, which states that,“Notes and coins issued by the Central Bank of Kenya may bear images that depict or symbolise Kenya or an aspect of Kenya but shall not bear the portrait of any individual.”Following the gazettement and launch of the new currency banknotes, activist Okiya Omtatah and East African Legislative Assembly lawmaker Simon Mbugua have moved to court to challenge CBK’s roll out of the new currency banknotes. The two have filed separate petitions in court on the grounds that the Central Bank did not engage the public in the design of the new currency notes, and the inclusion of founding president Mzee Jomo Kenyatta’s statue in the new generation currency, which they say is contrary to article 231 (4) of the constitution that states currency should not bear the portrait of an individual.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Kenyans must take old generation 1000 shilling notes to banks by October 1 and finds it to be TRUE.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.By partnering with Facebook and similar social media platforms, third-party fact-checking organisations like PesaCheck are helping to sort fact from fiction.

892,Kenya be hit by a cyclone?,"In March 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai, a Category 2 storm, made landfall in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, killing close to 1,000 people and leaving thousands homeless.Six weeks later, the International Federation of the Red Cross issued a warning that Tropical Cyclone Kenneth would hit Comoros, Tanzania and Mozambique on April 24. Kenya’s Meteorological Department also shared similar information on April 23, leading to fears that the cyclone would hit the Kenyan coast as well.Kenneth, which recorded maximum wind speeds equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane at landfall, is the strongest cyclone to hit Mozambique.In a statement to newsrooms, Kenya’s meteorological department dismissed claims that the cyclone could hit Kenya, adding that cyclones do not come close to the Equator.The Kenya Met Department added that Kenya would only feel the effects of the cyclone through heavy rainfall in some parts of the country.So the question is, can cyclones hit countries that are close to the equator?PesaCheck has investigated the claim by the Kenyan Meteorological Department that cyclones do not come close enough to the Equator to hit Kenya and finds it to be PARTIALLY TRUE based on the following data;In order to understand whether a cyclone can occur at the equator, it is important to first understand what it is and what causes it to happen. According to the United States’ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a tropical cyclone is a rotating, organized system of clouds and thunderstorms that originates over tropical or subtropical waters and has closed, low-level circulation.The terms “hurricane” and “typhoon” are regionally specific names for a strong tropical cyclone.Wind damage is classified using the Saffir-Simpson Scale, which rates hurricanes on a scale of 1 to 5 based on the damage their winds would cause upon landfall. Based on this, cyclones are assigned a category based on one-minute maximum sustained winds.Category 1 cyclones have sustained winds of at least 119 km/h (74 mph). The highest classification in the scale, Category 5, consists of storms with sustained winds over 251 km/h (156 mph).Cyclones occur in areas where there is low pressure. For a cyclone to form, large, still warm ocean area with a temperature above 26.5°C is required, where a body of warm air forms just above the ocean’s surface. As this air warms, it expands, becomes lighter and rises, leading to a sustained low pressure area. Low altitude winds blow in to replace this air that has risen. This air is warmed and also rises.The rising air contains large amounts of water that has evaporated from the ocean’s surface. As it rises, it cools, condensing to form huge clouds. These clouds eventually become very thick and heavy.Condensation then releases the latent heat energy stored in the water vapour, providing the cyclone with more power. This forms a self-sustaining heat cycle. Drawn further upwards by the new release of energy, the clouds can grow to 12–15 km high.The force created by the earth’s rotation on a tilted axis, known as the Coriolis effect, causes rising currents of air to spiral around the centre of the tropical cyclone. These currents blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.Because the earth’s Coriolis force is zero at the equator, air tends to flow straight into centres, so any areas of low pressure will dissipate before a self-sustaining heat cycle can form.According to the United States’ National Ocean Service, in order for a tropical cyclone to form, there must be a minimum distance of at least 500 km from the equator. Since, according to National Geographic, one degree of latitude covers about 111 km, this means that tropical cyclones cannot occur past 4.5° N or S of the equator.However, 17 tropical cyclones have occurred within 3°N and 3°S of the equator, and 3 of them have happened in the Indian Ocean. The one that came closest to Kenya is Cyclone Agni which occurred in late 2004 in the North Indian Ocean, affecting the coast of Somalia.For context, Nairobi is 1° 17' South, Mombasa is 4° 2' South, Lodwar is 3° 7' North, and Wajir is 1° 44' NThe cyclone closest to the Equator in recorded history is Tropical Storm Varmei, which formed at 1.4°N in the Northwest Pacific Ocean.According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), such an event is extremely rare, and it resulted from a combination of topography and meteorology, rather than Earth’s rotation. Dr C. P. Chang, who analyzed the storm, attributed its origin to the fact that everything leading to its formation was just the right size and in the right place, for long enough.“The odds of this happening again are about once every 100 to 400 years”, Dr Chang added, noting, “Due to how they form, it’s a rule that cyclones are not supposed to develop there.”Therefore, though rare, the possibility of a cyclone forming at the Equator is not at a complete zero, meaning the claim by the Kenya Meteorological Department PARTIALLY TRUE.According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, over the past 50-plus years, the earth’s oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the extra heat generated by global warming, becoming warmer as a result. Since warm sea surface temperatures fuel hurricanes, a greater temperature increase means more energy, and that allows these storms to increase in intensity. This, of course, must still be above the 26.5°C threshold required for a cyclone to form.Climate change could lead to more locations being affected by tropical storms. Warmer seas could cause the areas where the storms would form to extend further north and south of the Equator. This means that climate change will not increase the possibility of cyclones happening at the Equator.The existence of tropical cyclones that have occurred near the equator does not show the full picture to the claim that by the laws of physics, cyclones cannot come this close to the equator, therefore making this claim PARTIALLY TRUE.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, maintains a list of names to be used for tropical cyclones. The names on the list must be short, distinctive, and relevant to their cultural and geographic areas so that they are easy for people to remember.Names of storms which cause a lot of damage are never used again such as Katrina (2005) and Sandy (2012).Kenya falls in the Southwest Indian Ocean region, which covers the Indian Ocean in the Southern Hemisphere between the eastern coast of Africa and the 90° East longitude. The other countries in the region are Tanzania, South Africa, Mauritius, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Seychelles, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Comoros and France (by virtue of the country’s Indian Ocean territories).Each country provides suggested names for cyclones, which alternate between male and female names, and these are listed in the 2016 Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan for the South-West Indian Ocean. Cyclones “Idai” and “Kenneth” were contributed by the Meteorological organizations in Zimbabwe and Seychelles respectively.Kenya’s contributions for the 2016/17 season are Jeruto and Ursula, while the 2017/18 are Eliakim and Wagner, and the 2018/19 contributions are Lorna and Quentin.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

Failure to which, you should start packing your bags and belongings and move to your own countries…”In March 2019, State House announced the temporary suspension all of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s social media accounts after unauthorised individuals gained access to them.On April 1, The High court of Kenya barred the government from using Huduma Namba to withhold any service or bar citizens from accessing public services.Justice Weldon Korir, Pauline Nyamweya and Mumbi Ngugi while ruling on the matter said that it is in the public interest for the government to use the Huduma Namba data collection system to provide a ‘single source of truth’, but it should not be used to infringe on the rights of individuals, be they citizens or non-citizens.Based on this ruling, Kenyans cannot be compelled to register for the Huduma Namba, and they also cannot be denied government services if they do not register.This claim comes amid other false claims about the Huduma Namba, including one from Tana River county commissioner, Oning’oi Ole’sosio, stating that those without the number will be considered aliens, and another by Communications Authority of Kenya director general Francis Wangusi stating that those who have not registered for the number will have their SIM cards suspended.

922,Uganda benefited more than Kenya in bilateral trade since 2015?,"On March 31, 2019 the Daily Nation published an article claiming that since 2015, trade between Kenya Uganda has been increasingly benefiting Uganda, stating that in 2012, Kenya sold goods worth KSh76 billion to Uganda, but those sales have dropped to KSh62 billion in 2017, as Uganda sold goods worth KSh49 billion to Kenya.The article was looking into the trade agreements signed between Kenya and Uganda during President Yoweri Museveni’s two day visit to Kenya in March 2019.So the question is, has Uganda benefited more than Kenya in bilateral trade since 2015?PesaCheck has looked into the claim that trade between Kenya and Uganda since 2015 has been benefiting Uganda and finds it to be FALSE for the following reasons:According to the Economic Surveys of 2018 and 2017 published by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, total value of exports to Uganda far outweighs imports from Uganda as shown below:The value of imports from Uganda more than doubled from Sh19 billion in 2016 to Sh42 billion in 2017 on account of increased imports of milk and milk products (excluding butter and cheese), beans, animal feeds, maize, and other unmilled cereals (excluding wheat and rice). According to KNBS, the value of imports of these commodities accounted for 66.2 per cent of the total imports from Uganda in 2017. Value of exports to Uganda increased to Sh49 million in 2018 due to increased imports of maize, sugar, milk and animal feeds.A look at the East African Community (EAC) Trade and Investment Report 2017 shows that Kenya’s imports from the rest of the region increased by 81.7 percent, from US$ 324 million in 2016, to US$ 590 million in 2017. These were largely driven by increased imports from Uganda, which rose to US$ 407 million in 2017 from US$ 190 million in 2016 . The rise was largely due to increased imports of milk, dry beans and raw materials for the preparation of animal feeds to meet domestic shortfalls resulting from the drought during the first half of 2017.Exports between EAC states declined during the period under review. This was as a result of falling intra-EAC export volumes of manufactured products like cement, iron and steel, salt, and pharmaceuticals. This could be attributed to:The report also shows that Kenya’s trade surplus with EAC Partner States declined from US$ 874.6 million in 2016 to US$ 521 million in 2017, and total exports to the East African region declined by 7.4 percent to US$ 1.1 billion, mainly reflecting lower exports to Uganda and Tanzania.Kenya was Uganda’s main regional trading partner, with imports including petroleum products, cement, iron and steel and pharmaceutical products. Exports to Uganda accounted for 54.5 percent of Kenya’s total intra-EAC exports, to stand at $483 million, which when converted to Kenya Shillings amounts to Sh47.68 billion (using the 2018 average conversion rate of 1USD=101.29 KES).The Central Bank of Kenya puts the value of imports from Uganda in 2018 at Sh49.44 billion, while the value of exports to Uganda stood at Sh61.86 billion.While data from the Economic Survey and the Central Bank of Kenya shows that Kenya’s imports from Uganda have remained above the Sh40 billion mark since 2017, the value of Kenya’s exports to Uganda remain higher, thus making the claim that Uganda has been benefiting more since 2015 FALSE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

946,almost all of Kenya’s 2018/19 revenue gone into repayment of debt?,"Kenya’s appetite for debt has stirred up plenty of debate over the past year, with critics questioning how sustainable the current debt levels are in the medium term. According to an article published by The Standard Newspaper, on March 26, 2019, almost all the revenue collected in the past nine months in the country went into repaying debt.According to the article, Kenya collected Sh900 billion in revenues from tax against a debt repayment of Sh870 billion, leaving just Sh30 billion to cover government expenses.The country’s debt hit the 5 trillion shilling mark in May 2018, prompting the International Monetary Fund to raise the risk of debt distress from low to moderate in its October 2018 report on the country.So the question is, has almost all of the revenue collected in the eight months to February 2019 gone to repayment of debt?PesaCheck has looked into the The Standard’s claim that almost all of the revenue collected in the eight months to February 2019 has gone to repayment of debt and find is to be FALSE for the following reasons:According to Gazette Notice №2646 dated March 22, 2019, Kenya’s total tax income as at February 28, 2019 stood at Sh900 billion. This is 56% of the total estimated tax revenue for the entire financial year, which is Sh1.605 trillion.The estimate was itself adjusted downwards from Sh1.690 trillion for the year ending June 2019. If the Kenya Revenue Authority is to meet the targets set by the National Treasury, it has to collect an additional Sh700 billion by the close of the fiscal year on June 30, 2019.The notice also indicates in the eight months to February 2019, the National Treasury paid Sh413 billion out of a debt obligation of Sh870 billion. According to Treasury’s estimates for recurrent expenditure for the year ending June 2019, Kenya’s debt for the current financial year is broken down as follows:According to the 2019 African Economic Outlook Report by the African Development Bank (AfDB), debt composition in African countries has shifted from concessional loans towards commercial foreign debt, which is more expensive to service, as has been seen with the number of African countries raising funds through eurobonds.The credit dynamics across the continent have also changed, with countries shifting from the traditional American and European bilateral lenders to emerging lenders like China.New loans from China to African countries stood at $2 million in 2002 and grew by more than eight times to $17 million in 2013. This claim is reinforced by the Economic Survey 2019 released by Kenya’s Bureau of Statistics which shows that the amount of money owed to China increased sevenfold from Sh80 billion in 2014 to Sh560 billion by the end of 2018.National Treasury estimates show that Sh97.7 billion of the Sh870 billion debt will go towards repayment of the debut international sovereign bond issued in June 2014. The interest payment due in 2018/19 amounts to Sh19.41 billion, while the debt redemption stands at Sh78.30 billion.Gazette Notice №2464 of March 2019 shows that after settling debt to the tune of Sh413 billion, the government was left with Sh487 billion in tax revenues, which is more than half (54.11%) of the revenue collected for the eight months to February 2018. However, the government is required to clear the the remaining Sh457 billion outstanding debt by the close of the current fiscal year.From the data we have looked at, 46% of the government’s revenues went into repaying debt in the first eight months of 2018/19. This is contrary to the claim by The Standard that almost all the revenue collected in the past nine months in the country went into repaying debt, thereby making the claim FALSE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

972,President Uhuru Kenyatta’s 2019 State of the Nation Address,"On April 4, 2019, President Uhuru Kenyatta gave his annual State of the Nation address in a joint sitting of the 12th parliament as required by law. Article 132 of the constitution requires the president to report, in an address to the nation, on all the measures taken and the progress achieved in the realization of the national values, referred to in Article 10.During the address, President Kenyatta outlined some of the achievements of the Jubilee administration, including health, renewable energy, economic growth, and revenue allocations to the counties.PesaCheck looked into some of the claims and came to the following conclusions:Verdict: FALSEBasis of the verdictArticle 202 of the Constitution of Kenya provides that:A look at the County Allocation of Revenue Acts (2013–2018) shows that the total amount transferred to the counties by the national government stands at Sh1.68 trillion as shown below (figures do not include conditional loans and grants from development partners).The County Allocation of Revenue Act 2018 shows that the initial allocation of equitable share for 2018/19 was Sh314 billion. However, the National Treasury revised the figure downwards to Sh304.96 billion due to shortfalls in revenue collection nationally since 2015/16.Out of the estimated Sh330 billion allocation for county governments in 2018/19, the National Treasury had released Sh 177.3 billion as at February 28, 2019. This brings the total amount of money transferred by the National Treasury to the county governments since 2013 to Sh1.53 trillion, contrary to President Kenyatta’s claim that more than Sh1.7 trillion has been transferred to counties since 2013. This makes his claim FALSE — Ann NgengereVerdict — TRUEBasis of the verdictData from the Economic Survey 2018 shows that Kenya’s economy grew by 5.9% in 2013 before declining marginally to 5.4% the following year. 2017 recorded the slowest growth during the five year period under review, posting economic growth of 4.9%.The average economic growth in the five years to 2017 is 5.56%. This makes the president’s claim TRUE. It is also true that the country’s economic growth outperformed the global average. According to data published by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global economic growth was as follows:Based on the above data, the average global economic growth between 2013 and 2017 was 2.96%, which is lower than Kenya’s average growth of 5.56%, thereby making President Uhuru Kenyatta’s claim TRUE.Economic growth is an important indicator of the health of an economy and is the most commonly used measure of the economic well-being of a nation. However, economic growth is an imperfect measure of analysis when determining a country’s economic development. A cross-country comparison by gross domestic product (GDP) gives a better indication of which country is faring better economically.According to the World Trade Report 2014, developing economies have grown much faster that developed countries and have played a key role in the global economy. However, they still remain much poorer than developed countries.Data from the World Bank shows that in 1961, Kenya had an economic growth rate of -7.8% while the United States grew by 2.3%. In 2017, Kenya’s economic growth was 4.9%, with the U.S economy growing by 2.3%. However, a look at the GDP data shows that while Kenya’s economic growth was more than double that of the US in 2017, the economy was valued at $79.26 billion while America’s economy was valued at 19.39 trillion, almost 25 times the size of Kenya’s economy. — Ann NgengereVerdict: FALSEBasis of the verdictAccording to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics Economic Survey 2018, the primary completion rate rose from 81.3% in 2016 to 83.1% in 2017 (their most recent data).According to a Daily Nation article dated February 6, 2019, the Ministry of Education published a status report which showed that out of 1,033,901 pupils that sat for KCPE in 2018, 873,692 reported to schools, representing an 85% transition rate.Under the government’s Policy on Universal Access to Basic Education that seeks to ensure that all children enroll in Primary School and complete their Secondary School Education, with a 100% transition rate, a total of 1,033,901 pupils were expected to report to the secondary schools countrywide. 873,692 reported to their respective schools by February 4th 2019, which means that 15.5% are still out of school.Additionally, according to the World Bank’s latest data on progression to secondary school rates in Africa, Kenya was at the top in 2015 with 99.2%, with Cabo Verde taking the top spot in 2016 with 99.4%. Data on Kenya has not been updated for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.This indicates that based on the status report from the Ministry of Education on how many Form 1 students had reported to school by February 4th 2019, President Uhuru Kenyatta’s claim that there has been a 100% transition rate is FALSE. — Soila KenyaVerdict: FALSEBasis of the verdictAccording to the Kenya Economic Survey 2018, 75% of the energy used for electricity generation in 2017 was from renewable sources (47% Geothermal, 27.4% Hydro, 0.6% Wind).The World Economic Forum, notes that as of December 2018, 70% of the nation’s installed electricity capacity comes from renewable energy sources, which is more than three times the global average.The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Kenya ranked Kenya 9th in the world for its geothermal power generating capacity as of 2017. South Africa has the highest amount of megawatts (MW) of energy coming from renewable energy sources at 4959 MW. On the other hand, Kenya produces 1642 MW of energy from renewable or “green” sources, out of the total 2,264.4 MW produced in 2017. This confirms that about 75% of energy use in the country is from renewable sources meaning that in Africa alone, Kenya is not at the top of the chart in terms of overall “green” energy use.This shows that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s claim that 85% of Kenya’s energy is from renewable energy is FALSE. — Soila KenyaVerdict: INCONCLUSIVEBasis of the verdictAccording to the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis (KIPPRA)’s 2018 Assessment of Healthcare Delivery in Kenya under the Devolved System, healthcare is a devolved function, and there has been an increase in the number of health facilities as counties sought to increase healthcare access by the public. 33 counties do not meet the WHO recommendations for health centres. Only seven counties surpass the requirement, with an additional seven failing to meet more than 50% of the requirements. The under-performance can be attributed to the low investment that existed in infrastructure development in underserved areas over a long period before devolution.According to Development Initiatives Pro-poor analysis of Kenya’s 2018/19 budget estimates, the Ministry of Health has been allocated Ksh 90 billion or 3.6% of the 2018/19 budget. This amount is higher than allocations in 2017/18 by 47.8%. Allocations to the Programme for Basic Insurance for Poor and Informally Employed People has increased by 14.3% to Ksh 800 million from Ksh 700 million in 2016/17.Despite the increment in budget allocation to the health ministry in the 2018/2019 financial year, no data has been made publicly available to support the claim that after the launch of the UHC pilot project in December 2018, there has been a 39% increase in access to essential health services in the counties of Isiolo, Nyeri, Kisumu and Machakos. The claim by President Uhuru Kenyatta is therefore INCONCLUSIVE. — Soila Kenya.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

However, the amount in question is Sh3.6 million going by several media reports and not Sh5.5 million as reported by Tuko.According to Standard Digital, Wickson Njoroge, a property contractor, sued the apostle after he reneged on their agreement to lease out a house in Karen.The televangelist was arrested on April 4 and was held overnight at Central Police Station for interrogation. Media reports indicate he was released the following morning on police bond. Following his release, the pastor recorded a video denying claims that he spent the night in police custody.According to the Police Act a suspect may be released on cash bail by the officer in charge of a police station. It reads in part,“The Police Force Standing Orders require the officer in charge of a police station to release any person arrested on a minor charge on the security of cash bail, as a general rule, unless the officer has good grounds for believing that the arrested person will not attend court when required to do so. This cash bail should be handed into court by the date on which the arrested person should appear in court, and a receipt obtained.”Pastor Ng’ang’a is not new to controversy. Barely a month ago, he was arrested and charged after threatening unspecified consequences to Royal Media Services Director, Strategy & Innovation, Linus Kaikai. This was after Kaikai called for regulation of pastors in the country, referring to them as cold blooded evangelical vampires, living off the blood of their flock all in the name of Jesus.Ng’ang’a denied the charges and was released on a cash bail of Sh200,000.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Pastor James Ng’ang’a defrauded a businessman Sh5.5 million and finds it to be a MIXTURE.",MIXTURE:

978,None of these photos of makeshift bridges are from Siaya,"A post published on Facebook showing people crossing flooded rivers aided by makeshift bridges in Ugenya Constituency in Siaya County is a HOAX.The post linked the state of the bridge to the fact that Siaya senator James Orengo previously served as Member of Parliament for Ugenya Constituency before becoming senator in 2013. In the comments section of the post, Isco Nyongesa laid blame on the senator, claiming that “The senator from the area is to blamed for not educating them.”A reverse image search reveals that the first photo is actually from Rwanda and was taken in May 2016 after heavy rains pounded the country, leaving dozens dead and thousands homeless. The torrential rains caused landslides that blocked roads and damaged infrastructure in the northern region of the country.The authenticity of the second photo cannot be fully verified. However, a reverse image search reveals that the picture was first shared on Twitter in May 2018. An analysis of the picture by metapicz, a data extraction tool for images, only reveals that the photo was taken in January 2012, with no location provided.Therefore, it is unclear if the image was actually from Ugenya as claimed.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the makeshift bridges shared on Facebook depict the situation in Ugenya Constituency, Siaya County and finds it to be a HOAX.",HOAX:

980,Huduma Namba registration does not involve insertion of a microchip under the skin,"A Facebook post claiming that the National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS) registration exercise that kicked off on April 2, 2019 will involve inserting microchips under the skin is FALSE.The post appears to have been lifted from amazing facts.org, and has been edited to include a warning to Kenyans to avoid the NIIMS registration exercise. It links the registration to the mark of the beast, a prophecy in the Bible that implies that citizens would not be allowed to perform transactions without a unique identifier, in this case a subdermal implant containing personal identification data.The National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS) is meant to save biometric, demographic and physical details of all Kenyan residents, and this information will be linked to a unique numerical identifier, dubbed ‘Huduma Namba’. There is no mention of an implant in any of the documentation, but rather, promotional images have featured a card with a machine-readable chip.The requirements for registration are a national identity card, a birth certificate or a driving licence. The registration exercise was also meant to last 30 days, before the government extended it to 45 days. If anyone was not registered, the implication was that they would be denied access to government services.However, on April 1, 2019 , the High Court ruled that the government should not make the exercise mandatory and neither should it issue deadlines on the registration exercise.The Huduma Namba pilot phase kicked off in 15 counties in February 2019, ahead of the mass rollout which was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta on April 2, 2019 in Machakos County.The national launch had to be delayed pending the hearing of a case before the High Court, following a suit by the Kenya Human Rights Commission, the Nubian Rights Forum, and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights on the grounds that Kenya lacked proper legislation on data protection.The High Court declined to halt the registration exercise, but it did strike out provisions for the registration of DNA information and GPS coordinates, and in addition, the registration exercise was made voluntary rather than mandatory, meaning that the government cannot compel any person to register on NIIMS as was previously the case.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Huduma Namba registration process will involve the insertion of a microchip under the skin and finds it to be FALSE.",FALSE:
981,Both Makueni and Nyandarua Counties received unqualified audit opinions,"An article published on Facebook by Kenya-today.com claiming that Makueni governor Kivutha Kibwana was the first governor to get an unqualified audit opinion fails to mention that Nyandarua governor Francis Kimemia also got an unqualified audit report.The article is therefore factually inaccurate.While it is true that Makueni received a favourable audit opinion, it was not the only county that got an unqualified opinion from the Auditor General in 2017/18. The article only mentions Prof. Kivutha Kibwana as the first governor to get a clean bill of health while, yet Nyandarua County also received an unqualified opinion in the Auditor General’s county reports for the last fiscal year.A look at the county assembly reports shows that only Makueni and Nyandarua received a clean bill of health in the financial year 2017/18. These makes them the first counties to receive an unqualified opinion since the onset of devolution six years ago.An unqualified audit opinion is an independent auditor’s judgment that a company’s financial statements are fairly and appropriately presented, without any exceptions, and in compliance with accounting standards.The Council of Governors and Governor Kibwana tweeted congratulatory messages to both Nyandarua and Makueni counties for the achievement.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that Governor Kivutha Kibwana is the first governor to get a clean bill of health on the use of public funds since the advent of devolution and finds it to be MISLEADING.This post is part of an ongoing series of PesaCheck fact-checks examining content marked as potential misinformation on Facebook and other social media platforms.",MISLEADING:
982,needs to do more to achieve gender balance in leadership,"International Women’s Day is marked on the 8th of March every year to celebrate the achievements of women, and as a focal point for the movement of women’s rights globally. The day is marked with increasing calls for gender equality in academia, politics and the private sector to empower women.The 2019 International Women’s Day theme is Balance for Better, highlighting a need to include women in decision-making, as well as in resource allocation and distribution. Despite the fact that gender balance is a key enabler of growth and development in economies and communities, the world still has a long way to go to attain given the current state of affairs.‘Balance for Better’ is a timely theme in the Kenyan context, especially following the promulgation of the 2010 constitution, hailed as one of the most progressive in the world.However, despite key provisions for equitable representation in elected offices, Kenya is the only country in East Africa yet to implement a law on affirmative action in order to realize gender balance in political representation.Meanwhile, the overall global gender gap — the term used to refer to the average difference in remuneration for men and women — is currently at 32%, meaning that women worldwide make on average 68% of what men earn, and this gap will take 108 years to close, as the 2018 Global Gender Report by the World Economic Forum shows.The most challenging gender gaps to close are those in the economy and political aspects, which will take 202 and 107 years to close respectively.The Constitution of Kenya provides a powerful framework for the achievement of gender equality in the country. Article 27(8) states that “the State shall take legislative and other measures to implement the principle that not more than two-thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same gender”, with Article 81(b) reading “Not more than two-thirds of the members of elective public bodies shall be of the same gender.”However, despite these provisions, Kenya remains firmly in last place in terms of the representation of women in the East African region.The table below shows the political representation following the 2017 general elections (both elected and nominated):Almost 9 years since the promulgation of the new constitutional dispensation, the gender rule is yet to be enshrined into law.Despite the fact that Kenya’s constitution is the most liberal in comparison to its regional counterparts, with clauses calling for no more than two-thirds of the members of any elected body to be of the same gender, the country has performed dismally in terms of gender representation in elected office when compared with the rest of the East African Community.The country is still 41 women away from meeting the constitutionally accepted political threshold of 33% of the 349 members sitting in the National Assembly, with 76 out of the 349 members of parliament being women. The Senate needs 2 additional women members to meet the one third quota requirement.Kenya’s National Assembly and Senate rank last in East Africa in terms of the number of women, as the data below from the Inter-Parliamentary Union shows:It has been a bumpy 8-year journey for Kenya’s gender bill. In December 2012, the Supreme Court of Kenya, at the request of the Attorney General, issued an advisory opinion directing that the government address the two-thirds gender principle progressively and have it implemented by August 27, 2015.The AG had sought this advisory opinion based on the fact that the constitution did not provide the mechanisms through which the two-thirds gender rule would be actualized. Parliament then extended the time frame for the enactment of this provision by exactly one year, but failed to implement it yet again, leading to a petition by the Centre for Rights Education and Awareness and the Community Advocacy and Awareness Trust against Parliament and Senate at the High Court for violating the law.While issuing a ruling on this case in March 2017, Justice John Mativo directed Parliament and the Attorney General to enact the legislation within 60 days and report progress on the same to the Chief Justice. Again, this was not done. Parliament now faces the risk of dissolution, since its current composition does not meet the requirements of the constitution on the gender principle.The introduction of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill to discuss the implementation of the gender principle has failed four times due to a quorum hitch, putting the willingness of Parliament as currently constituted to question over its willingness to let this matter slide once again due to a technicality.Opponents of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) bill say that it will put further strain on the public purse, with nominated Member of Parliament David Sankok arguing that the persons nominated do not really represent the interests of the women, and that the nominations are not based on merit or competence.An article by the Daily Nation indicated that the potential cost of implementing the Gender Bill could be about Sh60 million in monthly salaries and allowances for the additional MPs, while the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) in an analysis published in 2015 found that the annual cost to taxpayers would be Sh21.1 million for every additional seat in the National Assembly, and Sh31.3 million for each additional seat in the Senate. This means that it would cost Sh865.1 million for an additional 41 women in the National Assembly and Sh62.6 million for 2 more female senators, bringing the total to Sh927.7 million.The IEA report further added that parliament is the least expensive branch of government, accounting for only 1.5% of national spending, with the executive spending 42 times more than parliament and 60 times more than the judiciary. IEA estimates that the maximum annual additional per capita cost of implementing the two-thirds rule is Sh57.83, (Sh865.1 million divided by Kenya’s population), an amount it considers affordable to Kenyans.The need for gender equality in political and economic fronts cannot be overstated. Despite being East Africa’s wealthiest nation, Kenya still lags behind in the implementation of constitutional provisions to give women a voice in matters of national importance.Gender balance is key in the social and economic development of any country, and the inequality that the global gender gap shows is a major problem at national, county and local levels.Therefore, Kenya should strive to ensure proper gender representation especially in the political and economic space in order to ensure that women have a voice when it comes to decision-making at the national and county levels, and in effect, balancing the equation for the better.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

988,Constituencies in Kenya Receive Sh5 billion Annually From The National Government?,"On February 24, 2019, the Daily Nation published an article claiming that constituencies in Kenya receive Sh5 billion annually from the National Government-Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) disbursed by the National Treasury. The article was looking into audit reports recently tabled before Parliament for review, which showed that a number of constituencies did not have documentation to back up their expenses.The National Government- Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF), formerly known as the Constituencies Development Fund, was established through the CDF Act of 2003. The fund is under the Ministry of Devolution and Planning and was established with the main aim of decentralizing infrastructural and socio economic development to grass root level.The Fund took on its current form when the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF) Act 2015 came into effect on February 19, 2016, replacing the CDF Act of 2013, after the High Court declared the latter unconstitutional as it violated division of power and functions between the national and county governments.So the question is, do Kenya’s constituencies receive 5 billion shillings annually?PesaCheck has looked into the claim published by the Daily Nation that constituencies in Kenya receive Sh5 billion annually and finds it to be FALSE for the following reasons:According to the NG-CDF Act of 2015, the National Government Constituencies Development Fund consists of an amount of not less than 2.5% of all the national government’s share of revenue as divided by the annual Division of Revenue Act enacted by Article 218 of the Constitution.This means that 2.5% of the revenue allocated to the national government after the division of revenue that is collected nationally goes to the CDF basket.Data provided in the Estimates of Development Expenditure reports published by the National Treasury between 2015 and 2018 also reveals that allocations to the constituencies vary each financial year, contrary to the claim that it is Sh 5 billion on an annual basis.It is clear from the NG-CDF Act of 2015 and the constituencies allocations tabulated above that the amount of money allocated to the constituencies varies from year to year and is not pegged at Sh 5 billion as reported by the Daily Nation, making this claim FALSE.Do you want us to fact-check something a politician or other public figure has said about public finances?

This means that Koffi Olomide will not serve his sentence in prison but if he violates the conditions of his sentence, he risks being sent to prison.PesaCheck has looked into an article claiming that musician Koffi Olomide has been jailed for raping a 15 year old dancer and finds it to have a FALSE HEADLINE.",FALSE

The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) has been comprised of troops from the governments of Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, that have been in Somalia helping fight Al-Shabab insurgents.In a resolution passed on July 30, 2018, the United Nations Security Council adopted developments of a transition plan for the progressive transfer of security responsibilities from AMISOM to the Somali security institutions and forces, and called for the swift finalisation of the detailed transition to ensure that Somali security forces take the lead for security responsibility by December 2021. The UN security Council also stressed that ‘there should be no further delay in the reduction of the level of uniformed AMISOM personnel beyond 28 February 2019’ and authorised Member States of the African Union to maintain the deployment of AMISOM until 31 May 2019.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that there’s panic in Somalia as KDF withdraws troops and finds it to have a FALSE HEADLINE.",FALSE

The Chinese aviation regulator said the decision was in line with its principle of zero-tolerance of safety hazards, after it emerged that there were substantial similarities between the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash in March 2019 and the Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610 crash in October 2018.Dozens of countries banned the Boeing 737 Max jets from their skies in the wake of the deadly plane crash in Ethiopia, a move that has prompted Boeing to temporarily suspend the operations of its entire fleet of 737 MAX planes across the globe.In a statement dated March 13, 2019, Boeing announced that it had recommended that the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) temporarily suspend operations of all Boeing 737 aircrafts as a precautionary measure.",TRUE:
1000,This photo used to depict the ongoing drought was actually taken in 2011,"A Facebook photo claiming that a malnourished man facing starvation is a victim of the ongoing drought in some parts of the country is a HOAX.The image, which was published on 14 March 2019, is accompanied by text that reads: “This is a preview into the situation in Turkana County. Meanwhile there’s maize rotting in Uasin Gishu and there’s a government that thinks Food Security is one of its pillars! SHAME!”It is true that Turkana County is one of the counties currently experiencing severe drought, but a reverse image search of the above photo reveals that it was taken in 2011 and used to accompany an article published on the Capital FM news website.In 2011, a severe drought hit the Horn of Africa with Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somali being worst affected. The drought, which was said to be the worst in 60 years, forced the then President Mwai Kibaki to declare it a national emergency.A March 2019 brief by the National Drought Management Authority shows that over 860,000 people require immediate food assistance in the 12 counties that are worst hit by the ongoing drought, with 192,800 of them being residents of Turkana County. The below- average short rains recorded in 2018 have led to an increase in the food insecure population in the country from 655,800 in August 2018 to 1,111,500 currently.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the photo shared on Facebook depicts a victim of the ongoing drought in Turkana County and finds it to be a HOAX.",HOAX:

1002,HEADLINE: Northlands City Project will not cost Sh500 billion,"An article published by biznakenya.com titled: “Construction of Kenyatta family’s Sh. 500 billion city kicks off,” contains both true and false information.The article that was published in September 2018, quotes a story that was run on the Business Daily (BD) in January 2016.While it is true that the Kenyattas are behind the Northlands City Project, the costs related to the project have not been availed, making it false to claim that it is Sh500 billion. A development plan submitted to the National Environmental Management Authority for approval in September 2015 by Integer Limited does not indicate the cost of the Northlands City Project, therefore making reports that it will cost Sh500 billion false.The article also wrongly estimates the distance of Northlands City from Nairobi’s CBD to be 15 kilometres instead of 25 kilometres as calculated by Google Maps, and by Triad Architects, the main architectures of the project.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the Kenyatta family has kicked off a Sh 500 billion construction of the Northern City in Kiambu County and finds it to contain a MIXTURE of both true and false information.",FALSE

Given that this was the same day that the Ethiopian Airlines flight to Nairobi crashed, it may have appeared to some that these two incidents were connected. However, the crash and the security alert issued by the embassy were totally unrelated.Part of the alert read:U.S. Embassy personnel are advised to avoid Meskel Square and limit movement around Addis Ababa on Sunday, March 10. U.S. Government travelers have been advised not to arrive or depart Bole International Airport on Sunday, March 10, and U.S. Embassy personnel are also temporarily prohibited from traveling to Oromia.A subsequent alert sent by the State Department on 10 March informed US citizens that it was safe to use the airport on March 10, but the article does not include this information.The alert read: “U.S. Government travelers may arrive or depart from Bole International Airport on Sunday, March 10.PesaCheck has looked into the claim that the US government had warned its citizens to avoid Bole Airport and finds it to contain a MIXTURE of both true and false information.",MIXTURE:
