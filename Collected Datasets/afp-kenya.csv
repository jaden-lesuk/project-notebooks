0,Fraudulent Facebook posts claim the World Bank is giving loans to small businesses in Africa,"Facebook posts inviting small business owners impacted by Covid-19 in Africa to apply for loans from the World Bank through the International Finance Corporation (IFC) have been shared hundreds of times. But the claim is false; the World Bank confirmed to AFP Fact Check that the posts emanated from fraudulent accounts linked to cybercrime attacks targeting the institution.In Kenya, the claim was published on Facebook pages (here and here) registered in the name of the country’s Sports Minister, Amina Mohammed.“World Bank frustrated at low uptake of Covid fund,” read the posts, which have since been removed from Facebook. “The World Bank has complained of the low number of Kenyans applying for the Covid fund which was approved all the way in May. The fund was meant to cushion small businesses against shocks caused by the pandemic but most Kenyans have shied away from applying. Kenyans willing to apply for the fund can do so only through IFC website.”IFC is the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group.Mohammed was also cited by Kenya’s People Daily, an online news site, in connection with the purported financing arrangement, while in Namibia, a similar claim was published here by an account created under the guise of the country’s finance ministry, which Facebook’s transparency information shows as being administered from Kenya.Links included in the posts supposedly lead potential applicants to the IFC website and a page with a form where they are invited to fill in their details.While the page appears to be official, on closer inspection the entire website is nothing more than a sophisticated clone of the real thing.Searching the URL provided in one of the posts on GoDaddy, an American internet domain registrar, reveals several suspicious details: the site domain was created on October 16, 2020 – just three days before the first of the false posts was published. Additionally, the domain is also registered in Kenya, while the World Bank has its headquarters in the US.A GoDaddy search of the link supplied in the post targeting Namibians reveals that this URL was registered on November 24, 2020, about a month before the false claim was shared on Facebook. The country of registration is indicated as Canada.The IFC’s authentic website – www.ifc.org – was created in December 1995 and registered to the World Bank in the US.Melissa Bryant, a spokeswoman for the World Bank, dismissed the Facebook posts as “fake”, noting that the fraudulent URLs were part of a larger cybercrime attack on the financial institution.“The stories and their content are inaccurate,” she said in an email to AFP Fact Check. “The World Bank mention originated on fake social media postings and websites that were part of a broader cybercrime attack against the World Bank Group.”Bryant explained that unknown attackers had impersonated the World Bank Group and Kenyan government officials to scam entrepreneurs and small businesses into paying advance fees, also called “processing fees” or “finder’s fees” for non-existent loans.This statement warning the public about the fraud was published on the real IFC website.Sports minister Mohammed’s chief of staff, Rose Wacuka, also told AFP Fact Check that the Facebook accounts linked to the minister were “fake”. Her authentic account can be found here.Mohammed’s page differs from the imposter accounts in notable ways: firstly, her page contains the prefix “Amb” for “ambassador” in the name (Mohammed was formerly a diplomat), which the others don’t.And, secondly, the fake accounts were created on October 19, 2020, and November 28, 2020, coinciding with the days that each one posted the same false claim. Mohammed had her page set up on June 4, 2014.AFP has previously debunked similar loan scams here and here.",1
1,"Photos show Honduran migrants trying to enter Guatemala, not post-election violence in Uganda","A post shared dozens of times on Facebook claims to show violent clashes between civilians and security forces in Uganda following the recent presidential election. The claim is false; the images are of a caravan of Honduran migrants who were blocked by Guatemalan soldiers upon entering the country.“Happening now in Uganda #UgandaDecides 2021,” reads a post published on January 18, 2021.The same claim was shared in other Facebook posts here and here.Tensions during Uganda’s presidential election last week led to the harassment and arrest of opposition members, attacks on the media, a government-imposed internet blackout, and at least 54 deaths, as AFP reported here. The pop-star-turned politician Bobi Wine campaigned to defeat Uganda’s long-serving president, Yoweri Museveni, but was ultimately unsuccessful.Despite poll violence, the images being shared in this Facebook post are not from Uganda.A reverse image search shows the photos were taken in Guatemala by the Spanish news service Agencia EFE; see originals here, here and here.The images depict a large caravan of Honduran migrants who were tear-gassed by Guatemalan soldiers on January 18, 2021, when they entered the country on their journey to the United States.AFP covered the story here.",1
2,These pictures do not show torture scenes of opposition supporters in Uganda,"A Facebook post claiming to show images of tortured supporters of Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine has been shared multiple times online. The claim emerged ahead of the presidential election on January 14, 2021, which will see Wine face off against incumbent President Yoweri Museveni. But the claim is false: the images are old and show scenes of police brutality in Nigeria and Zimbabwe.On January 3, 2021, this Facebook post shared three images: two showed three men with their limbs tied and their bodies suspended in the air while a third featured a  man's badly bruised back.According to the post, the men belonged to Wine’s campaign team and were arrested and tortured by the military under Museveni’s orders.The Facebook post, which tagged major international media organisations, reads: “Warning very brutal pictures. This is how #NUP campaign team that was arrested in Kalangala with his excellency Kyagulanyi Ssentamu Robert on orders of dictator Yoweri Kaguta Museveni and Muhoozi Kainerugaba. Are being treated in a Kasijjagirwa military barracks let the world see (sic).”NUP, which stands for National Unity Platform, is Wine’s political party.Facebook added a warning label to two of the images due to their graphic nature.While reports of Ugandan police violating human rights have been rampant in the lead-up to the presidential election, these photos do not show scenes from Uganda.A reverse image search of the tied-up men revealed that the two pictures were from Nigeria and featured in a BBC African Eye documentary titled: “The Torture Virus: Tabay 'rampant' among Nigeria’s security force”. ""Tabay"" refers to a type of torture in which a person's arms are pulled backwards and tied at the elbows, cutting circulation.In the documentary, the scenes are found at 25 seconds and at 6'18 minutes into the clip.A reverse image search of the third picture of a man’s bruised back revealed that it was captured in Zimbabwe during a protest over food and fuel shortages in January 2019. The image was used in major news reports here and here, where it was credited to the news agency Reuters.As reported by AFP, the violent protests erupted after the country’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced petrol prices would double. Police were accused of using excessive force during the protests, including by the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum.Uganda pollsTensions in Uganda are high as the country prepares to go to the polls on January 14, 2021. Pop-star-turned-politician Wine has been arrested multiple times ahead of the ballot and his presidential campaign events disrupted by the police on different occasions.Online misinformation has also been on the rise ahead of the polls. Facebook announced on January 13, 2021, that it was shutting down accounts belonging to Ugandan government officials accused of seeking to manipulate public debate ahead of elections.Museveni, one of Africa’s longest-serving rulers, had the constitution amended for a second time to allow him to run for a sixth term in 2021.Wine, 38, has become a popular opposition figure among youth in a country where the median age is less than 16.Since becoming an member of parliament in 2017, he has been routinely detained and put under house arrest, his concerts have been banned and his public rallies dispersed with teargas.",1
3,This picture shows Italian performance artist Vanessa Beecroft and orphaned Sudanese twins she tried to adopt,"A bogus Facebook post claiming to show a white Australian woman who married a man from South Sudan and gave birth to the “darkest twins ever” has been shared dozens of times online. The claim is false; the image is of Italian-born performance artist Vanessa Beecroft posing with Sudanese twins during the shooting of a film titled: “The Art Star and the Sudanese Twins”.“An Australian woman gave birth to twins and there father is a south Sudanese (sic),” reads one Facebook post from December 15, 2020.Included in the post is an image of a white woman nursing two black babies.The same image appears in another post with a similar claim that reads: “White/ Australian woman married to South Sudanese man, gave birth to darkest twin ever”.The claims, however, are false.The woman in the picture is not Australian, nor is there any evidence that she is married to a South Sudanese man. The babies are not hers either.A reverse image search on Google reveals that the woman is Vanessa Beecroft, an Italian performance artist. According to reports (here and here), Beecroft posed for the picture during a film she was shooting titled: “The Art Star and the Sudanese Twins”.The film follows the artist’s attempt to adopt orphaned Sudanese twins who she met and breastfed during her 2006 trip to Sudan, five years before the country split and the south gained independence. However, the adoption did not go through.Beecroft's work with the twins attracted controversy, and in 2009 she said she received death threats after being accused of exploiting the children. The photograph was exhibited again in 2015 at a German museum exhibition about representations of the concept of charity.",1
4,"This video shows a protest in South Africa, not Bobi Wine supporters in the UK","A video viewed thousands of times has been shared in Facebook posts claiming to show UK-based supporters of Ugandan presidential candidate Bobi Wine being dispersed by police while demonstrating outside their country’s embassy. The claim is false; the people in the video are members of South Africa’s Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) political party, who were marching against alleged racism at a Cape Town school where a whites-only dance party was allegedly organised.On November 20, 2020, this Facebook post shared a video showing a group of demonstrators being dispersed by police with a water cannon and tear gas. The post claimed that the protesters were supporters of Uganda’s opposition leader Bobi Wine in the UK.“The like minded #NUP_Hooligans abroad carried their stupidity mbu (that) to demonstrate around the Ugandan Embassy in the UK. But hihii.. the tear gas was even coloured and better spiced than the Ugandan one (sic),” reads the Facebook post in part.NUP refer to National Unity Party (NUP), the political party of Bobi Wine, a pop-star-turned-presidential-candidate whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.The same claim was shared here and here.Using the video verification tool InVID WeVerify, AFP Fact Check ran a reverse image search on multiple frames of the video and located tweets mentioning that the clip shows a protest by members of South Africa's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) political party.On November 20, 2020, there were media reports (here and here) about protests held by members of the EFF at Brackenfell High School against alleged racial discrimination after a “whites-only graduation party” was allegedly organised in October.During the protest, police dispersed the crowd using water cannons and tear gas and pictures captured by AFP allowed AFP Fact Check to spot the exact location where the video was recorded. The site of the drama was also caught on film during a report by local news channel, eNCA.From the recording on Facebook, the running battles with the police took place at a junction in front of brown apartments, across the road from a billboard with  “Kilimanjaro” on it.Going through pictures taken by AFP, we spotted the brown buildings and the Kilimanjaro billboard in two separate images.The captions on the images taken by AFP photographer Rodger Bosch read: “South African Police spray a water cannon towards members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) during a demonstration against alleged racism near Brackenfell High School, where a whites-only year-end dance party was allegedly organised last month, in Cape Town, on November 20, 2020.”We also spotted a mall called Bracken Manor in another AFP photograph from the same series of shots taken on the day of the protest.On Google Maps, we geolocated the mall to Paradys Street in Brackenfell, a northern suburb town in the Western Cape’s capital of Cape Town where the high school is located.This location also resembles the site of a live broadcast of the protest by eNCA. According to their report, police officers had cordoned off the area to Brackenfell High School, where protesters were aiming to march.On Google Maps, Bracken Manor is about 800 metres from Brackenfell High School.Additionally, while there is no proof in the media of protests that were held in the UK over Wine’s arrest, we located Uganda’s High Commission in the UK on Google Maps and the surroundings have no similarities to the video on Facebook.Last week, there were violent protests in Uganda following Bobi Wine's arrest. At least 37 people were reported dead during the protests pushing for the release of the pop star turned presidential candidate, who is seeking to unseat current President Yoweri Museveni in the January 2021 elections.",1
5,"Hoax tweets falsely claim support from Biden, Obama for Ugandan presidential challenger","A Facebook post shared more than a hundred times claims to show tweets from US president-elect Joe Biden and former president Barack Obama calling for the release of Ugandan opposition politician Bobi Wine who was detained on November 18, 2020. However, the tweets are fake; AFP Fact Check found that neither leader has commented on Uganda's political situation on their official Twitter accounts. Wine was freed on bail on November 20, 2020.On November 19, 2020, this Facebook post shared screenshots of two tweets purportedly published by Biden and Obama on their official Twitter accounts, along with the hashtag #FreeBobiWine.According to the timestamps in the screenshots, Biden tweeted at 8:54 pm followed by Obama at 8:59 pm on November 18, 2020.The tweets appear to have achieved major reach, with more than 2.5 million likes and retweets in total.The Facebook post went up a day after Wine, who is seeking to unseat Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in next year's scheduled election, was arrested allegedly for violating coronavirus regulations at his rallies. Deadly violent protests followed his detention, as reported by AFP. Wine was released on bail on November 20, 2020.While the US Mission in Uganda condemned the violence, Biden and Obama have made no public statement about the political troubles that have flared in the East African country.A scan of their Twitter accounts reveals that on November 18, 2020, Biden sent out two tweets; one thanking healthcare workers engaged in the fight against Covid-19 and another talking about a US national security meeting he and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris had with US national security experts.A search of Obama's feed on November 18, 2020, shows there were no tweets that day.While not conclusive since settings can be changed, the fake tweets have been reproduced in dark mode -- unlike the real accounts which use conventional black text on white background.Political tension in Uganda has been rising as the country gears up for a presidential election scheduled for January 2021. AFP Fact Check has already debunked false claims linked to the unrest here and here.",1
6,"This footage of a bustling intersection comes from Vietnam, not Kenya","A video showing motorbikes and vehicles zipping across a busy intersection has been viewed thousands of times on Facebook with the claim that it depicts Kisii, a town in Kenya. The claim is false; the footage, which has been sped up, was actually filmed in a Vietnamese city.“If you have not been to kisii town this is what you are missing,” reads a Facebook post shared more than 1,000 times since September 5, 2020.Kisii is a town located in south-western Kenya.The video is 38 seconds long and shows a busy street scene from overhead, with dozens of motorcycles and cars appearing to drive chaotically across a large intersection.Using the video verification tool InVID WeVerify, AFP Fact Check ran a reverse image search on multiple frames of the video and located the clip in YouTube videos here, here and here, which are described  as showing traffic in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh city. These videos show traffic moving at a normal speed, as opposed to the sped-up Facebook clip.A search with the keywords “motorcycle traffic in Vietnam” on Google turned up a similar video which is much clearer and also filmed from the same elevated angle. Visual cues like a petrol station, buildings and an electrical post are evident in both versions of the video.One of the standout features in both videos is a petrol station in the top right with blue and yellow corporate colours. A search of petrol stations in Vietnam revealed that Petrolimex, Vietnam’s liquefied petroleum gas state company, has the exact features.On Google Maps, we examined the different locations of Petrolimex in Vietnam and spotted this one which resembles the petrol station in the videos and is found on Trần Hưng Đạo street.Meanwhile, another video shows the same junction where Trần Hưng Đạo street crosses Nguyễn Văn Cừ street. Evident is a branch of Sacombank, a bank in Vietnam with blue and white branding and below it a restaurant called Jollibee. Both are situated opposite the petrol station and can be seen on Google Maps.Google Street View also reveals that the junction is controlled by traffic lights, meaning the traffic flow is controlled, contrary to the disorderly scene the video on Facebook appears to show because it has been manipulated to increase the speed. This video also shows the same.In contrast, we surveyed different junctions in Kisii town using Google Maps street views and there is no resemblance to the junction seen in the videos.",1
7,"This image of an injured journalist was taken during a protest five years ago, not at a recent rally","Posts claiming to show a Ugandan journalist brutally beaten by police officers during a recent political rally by pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine have been shared multiple times on Facebook. The claim is misleading; the picture of injured journalist Isaac Kugonza was taken five years ago during a protest. Kugonza told AFP Fact Check that he was scarred for life.“Journalist beaten by Uganda police today for covering bobi wine 's route to his office. MUSEVENI IS EVIL,” reads a Facebook post circulating in Uganda along with two images – one of an injured man on the ground and the other of a camera covered in blood.Another Facebook post carried a similar claim on this page, which is managed in Uganda, the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the social network’s transparency information.Similar claims (including one alleging the wounded man was shot) were shared on Twitter here and here.A reverse image search shows that the image has been online since 2015. It shows shows Ugandan TV journalist Isaac Kugonza lying wounded just moments after police opened fire to disperse a crowd protesting against law enforcement attempts to block Kampala city’s Lord Mayor, Erias Lukwago, from presenting his nomination papers for the mayoral seat five years ago.“I saw the photograph on social media when I was lying on the ground but that incident happened in 2015, not now,” Kugonza told AFP Fact Check.He insisted that an injury to his head was caused by a bullet, although police were quoted in this news report from the time saying that Kugonza was hit with a stone during scuffle.“I was shot in the head and I have a permanent injury. I don't know whether it was targeted at me or it was random and by accident,” Kugonza said in a phone call. “I got healed but the scar has remained and it continues to be a reminder of the shooting.”This video (at 1'06"" minutes) captures the moment when Kugonza, who was by then working for Delta TV, fell to the ground.In this 2016 report by Ugandan multimedia publisher New Vision, another picture from the incident, credited to Rhamadan Abbey, shows Kugonza on the ground, clearly in pain.Kugonza, who now works for local television station NTV Uganda, added: “I stopped going to the field and am now on the desk as editor at NTV/Spark Tv.”On November 3, 2020, presidential candidate Bobi Wine said he was detained, “beaten” and “tortured” by police minutes after he registered his candidacy to challenge President Yoweri Museveni in next year’s election.In televised footage, 38-year-old Wine was seen being pulled by police from his car and thrown into a van after submitting his nomination papers to election officials in the capital Kampala. Wine’s supporters were then violently dispersed.Following the incident, an online campaign under the hashtag #EndPoliceBrutalityInUganda was started, with online users sharing pictures and videos showing incidents of state-sponsored brutality. Some of the visuals were from recent incidents while others were old and unrelated to current events.An AFP correspondent in Uganda told AFP Fact Check that while religious and political leaders in the country have condemned how police handled the opposition presidential candidate, the anti-police brutality campaign has not received “much public participation”.According to a report by the Human Rights Watch, Uganda has a history of police brutality against protesters, which at times has led to fatalities.Political tensions in the east African country are high as the nation prepares for the election on January 14, 2021. Wine will be challenging Museveni, who has been in power for 33 years.",1
8,This is not a real ICC witness statement from a Kenyan lawyer accused of bribery,"A document shared dozens of times on Facebook purports to show a witness statement from Kenyan lawyer Paul Gicheru, who handed himself in to face accusations at the International Criminal Court (ICC) of bribing witnesses in a botched case against Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto. However, this document is not genuine. The ICC, which has not published any witness statement in this case, confirmed it was fake.A document using the ICC’s letterhead was posted on Facebook on November 3, 2020, just a day after Gicheru turned himself in. It is titled: “Witness statement, Paul Gicheru, taken at the International Criminal Court at 02-11-2020 18:05 HRS”.The caption on the Facebook post reads: “Lawyer Paul Gicheru who surrendered to the International Criminal Court yesterday has finally released an ICC witness statement in which he claims that his life is in danger from people within the Kenyan Republic.”The same document was posted on Facebook here on the same day.In the document, “Paul Gicheru” purportedly admits to bribing and influencing witnesses who were going to testify in Ruto’s trial, and claims this was under orders from the deputy president. The document also claims that his life is in “significant danger” and that he requests asylum.Gicheru was wanted under a 2015 arrest warrant by the ICC for allegedly bribing several prosecution witnesses to recant their testimony in the case against Ruto.Cases against President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto over post-election violence in 2007-8 collapsed in 2014 and 2016. The ICC dropped charges against Ruto and radio host Joshua Arap Sang in April 2016, with its chief prosecutor blaming a relentless campaign of victim intimidation for making a trial impossible.Fake ICC statementThe purported “witness statement” shared on social media is not genuine.“This document is a fabrication,” ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah told AFP Fact Check. “We urge caution regarding any document purporting to originate from the ICC that is not issued through one of the ICC’s official platforms or confirmed by the Court as being official.”All official documents pertaining to Gicheru’s case are published online in the ICC’s court records, which are available here. For example, on November 2, 2020, a document was published noting that he had turned himself in.The ICC letterhead and the document number at the bottom of the pages were used in the fabricated document published on Facebook the following day.The ICC has published several more official documents related to Gicheru’s case since then, but none of these are witness statements.Gicheru made his first appearance in court on November 6, 2020, as reported by AFP. Court officials read out charges against him of “corruptly influencing” witnesses for the prosecution to recant their testimony.“The allegations read out to me are not true, they are false,” he said, appearing by video link from the court’s detention centre due to coronavirus rules.",1
9,These are old images of Ugandan soldiers in Kampala after the US warned of a terror threat,"A post claiming to show soldiers patrolling Uganda’s Mbarara city a day before popstar-cum-politician Bobi Wine launched his presidential election campaign has been shared multiple times on Facebook. The claim is misleading: the images were taken by an AFP photographer in 2014 after the US warned Kampala of a possible terror threat at Entebbe International Airport.A Facebook post published on November 6, 2020, features two pictures of armed troops in a street and a caption that translates into English as: “That’s what's happening in Mbarara (a city in western Uganda) right now ...”Some online users in the comments appeared to believe that the images were recent and taken in Mbarara city where Wine, a 38-year-old opposition MP whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was expected to launch his official manifesto for the presidential race.However, a reverse image search on TinEye revealed (here and here) that the pictures were captured by an AFP photographer on July 3, 2014.The photos show security forces patrolling the streets of Uganda’s capital Kampala after the US had warned of a threat by an unknown group to attack Entebbe International Airport.“The alert came as travellers flying to the United States from Europe and the Middle East faced tighter security because of new concerns about the development of explosives that could circumvent airport security,” the AFP captions read.AFP covered the story here.Political tensions in the east African country have escalated ahead of national elections on January 14, 2021. Wine will be challenging President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for 33 years.Wine has become a popular figure among youth in a country where the median age is less than 16.Since becoming an MP in 2017, he has been routinely arrested and put under house arrest, his concerts banned and public rallies dispersed with teargas.Museveni, one of Africa’s longest-serving rulers, had the constitution amended for a second time to allow him to run for a sixth term in 2021.Wine launched his election campaign on November 7, 2020, in Mbarara amid beefed-up security.The launch came four days after he was detained while registering his candidacy. In televised footage Wine was seen being pulled by police from his car and thrown into a van after submitting his nomination papers to election officials in the capital Kampala. His supporters were then violently dispersed.",1
10,This video shows protesters storming the German embassy in Sudan in 2012,"A video of people storming a building has been shared thousands of times on Facebook, alongside claims that it shows protesters setting the French embassy in Sudan on fire in response to French President Emmanuel Macron’s remarks on Islam. However, the claim is false; this is an old video that shows protesters storming the German embassy in Sudan in 2012.The video was published on Facebook on October 24, 2020. The post’s Arabic caption reads, “The French embassy was burned down on Monday in response to French President Macron's Islamophobic remarks.”The same video was also shared in other Facebook posts here and here on the same date and with the same claim.However, this claim is false. By conducting a reverse image search on keyframes from the video using the InVID-WeVerify verification tool, AFP Fact Check found that the footage dates back to 2012. Different parts of the video appeared in several news reports at the time.The footage seen in the video from 0’00 to 1’01 -- and again from 1’46 to 1’57 -- was featured in a CNN report posted on the channel’s YouTube page on September 14, 2012.The footage from 1’02 to 1’14 was featured in an Al-Jazeera report published on September 15, 2012. The footage from 1’15 to 1’45 can be seen in a  report from the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle published on September 14, 2012.The footage from 2’23 to 2’26 matches footage in an AFP report in German, published on the same date. Some of this footage is also repeated in other parts of the video.AFP Fact Check was not able to find the source of the footage from 2’02 to 2’12; however, it features the same protester that appears in front of the German embassy in another part of the video (at 1’15) in footage featured in the Deutsche Welle report.All these video reports from 2012 show the same incident, which took place on September 14, 2012, when protesters stormed the German embassy in Khartoum.At the time, AFP reported that the protesters set the building on fire in reaction to the screening of a film perceived as offensive to Islam and Muslims. The British embassy in Khartoum was also targeted. Fury over the film led to protests in many countries around the world.Meanwhile, there have been no reports of any recent attacks against France’s embassy in Sudan.BackgroundThe false claim was published on Facebook just days after the French president promised to intensify a clampdown on Islamist extremism.Macron’s remarks came in reaction to the murder of 47-year-old teacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded in a Paris suburb after he showed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed during a class on free speech. These were the same images that sparked a deadly attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo when they were originally published five years ago.Macron has vigorously defended the publication of the cartoons on free speech grounds.France’s interior minister Gerald Darmanin said that France was “at war with Islamist extremism” after a knifeman brutally killed three people at a church in the southern city of Nice on October 29, 2020.The killings happened on the same day as a knife attack by a Saudi citizen at the French consulate in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, which left a guard wounded. Neither the Saudi authorities nor the French embassy gave a possible motive for the attack.",1
11,Videos purporting to show violence during recent elections in Zanzibar are old and unrelated,"Two videos claiming to show recent violence in Zanzibar following a disputed election have been viewed thousands of times on Twitter. The claims are false: one of the video clips dates back to 2005 while the other was debunked earlier this year by AFP Fact Check after it was used falsely to depict Nigerians protesting against a Supreme Court ruling.“This is Zanzibar today army is shooting,” reads a tweet from October 25, 2020, viewed more than 5,000 times.From above, the video in the tweet shows a large crowd converging on a dusty street before the people suddenly scatter in all directions after hearing what sound like gunshots.The clip appears to be speeded up and the action moves at a noticeably rapid pace.Four days later, another video was tweeted, this time with the logo of American news agency the Associated Press (AP).“Things not looking good in Zanzibar #ZanzibarLivesMatter,” the tweet claimed.In it, a 30-second clip shows armed security officers engaging in running battles with civilians and streets barricaded with burning tyres.However, neither video is recent and both are unrelated to the election in Zanzibar on October 28, 2020.Using the verification tool InVID-WeVerify, AFP Fact Check ran reverse image searches on keyframes from the first video and found that the clip has been used before to depict a traders’ protest in Uganda (here and here), a riot in Mali and a protest in Nigeria against a Supreme Court ruling that removed a state governor.AFP Fact Check had already debunked the same video here in January 2020, and established that it was posted online a day before a state election in Nigeria was nullified by the Supreme Court. While the precise location of the video remains unknown, its prior publications on social media mean it wasn’t shot during this week’s election in Zanzibar.The second video with the AP label was found in the American news agency’s archives on YouTube (here) and on its website (here). The agency's archives indicate that the clip was shot in 2005, capturing unrest in Zanzibar after a disputed election at the time.Zanzibar, which is Tanzania’s semi-autonomous archipelago, has a history of violence-plagued polls.Both Zanzibar and Tanzania held elections this week but opposition leaders have claimed that the twin polls were marred by fraud and called on their supporters to demonstrate peacefully.In Zanzibar, AFP reporters witnessed security forces fire teargas and live rounds, and assault civilians on the island.",1
12,Hoax embassy pages falsely claim Trump made visa announcements for Kenya and Liberia,"Posts claiming that the US has announced permanent “E-visas” for Kenya and Liberia have been shared multiple times on Facebook. The claim is false; the claim was shared by Facebook pages impersonating those of the two African nations' embassies, which both dismissed the announcements as hoaxes.On October 18, 2020, a Facebook page called ""Embassy of Kenya Washington DC"" shared a post claiming that US President Donald Trump officially communicated his decision about the allocation of E-visas to Kenya’s ambassador Robinson Githae.“President Donald Trump following the tragic death of over 240,000 Americans who died from Covid 19, has signed in his recent Executive Order stating that interested citizens of the Republic of Kenya who measure in some special professions are eligible for Permanent America E-Visa,” reads the post, attributed to Githae.It adds: “The information was officially communicated to His Excellency Robinson Njeru Githae, Kenya’s Ambassador to the United States.”The post further listed professions and specialists eligible for the purported permanent E-visa, adding that the opening would accommodate up to 6000 people.The page only has 43 followers and was created on the same day as the post was published, according to Facebook’s transparency information. Apart from a reshare of the post the following day, there since has been no other activity on the page.A few days earlier, on October 14, 2020, a similar post was shared on a Facebook page called ""Liberia Embassy in Washington DC"".“American E-Visa announcement for the citizens of Liberia,” reads the post, attributed to the country’s ambassador to the US George S. W. Patten.Again, the page was created only a day before the post was published, with no other activity since.The two Facebook pages behind the purported announcements are not official pages of the respective embassies.Both embassies dismissed the announcements as “false” and “fraudulent” in statements on their official websites (here and here).“The Liberian Embassy wishes to inform the public that the information is absolutely false and misleading and that at no time did the Ambassador receive such communication from the US President or any official of the US government,” reads part of the Liberian embassy’s statement.Their Kenyan counterparts, whose official Facebook page is verified with more than 10,000 followers, described the announcement as “fraudulent” and warned the public against sending money to any of the phone numbers provided in the posts.“The announcement did not originate from the Embassy, should be ignored and not be circulated under any circumstances. Do not send any money to the fake numbers being circulated. The indicated phone numbers do not belong to the embassy.”The E-visa category allows “treaty traders” and investors to travel to the United States under a bi-lateral treaty of commerce and navigation. While the United States maintains treaties of commerce and navigation with Liberia, Kenya is not on the list.President Trump’s administration has been tightening rules for immigration visas by narrowing the list of qualifications eligible for the visa and reducing the length of stays for workers in some fields.On October 6, 2020, the department of homeland security announced stringent measures affecting H-1B visas for highly skilled workers. The visa programme has been widely used by Silicon Valley firms to bring in engineers and other skilled workers but, according to the new regulations, the firms will be forced to make offers to US residents before seeking to bring in foreigners.",1
13,"This image shows children taking a nap under a tree at a school in Nigeria, not in South Sudan","An image of children sleeping under a tree being has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook, alongside the claim that it shows schoolchildren in South Sudan. However, the claim about the location is false; the photo was taken in Nigeria at a neglected school that was later renovated by an outreach organisation.The photo was posted to Facebook here on September 16, 2020, with the caption: “Peter Makal, a teacher at a primary school in Juba, was seriously confused after he prepared the lesson for his class, but found them asleep following their breakfast.”Juba is the capital of South Sudan.In the image, more than a dozen small children are seen asleep beneath the shade of a tree while a man sitting on a chair keeps watch. Next to him is a small chalkboard.The photo was also posted with the same claims on Facebook here, here, here, and here.While the image is genuine, the claim that it was taken in South Sudan is false.Children under a tree in NigeriaAFP Fact Check conducted a reverse image search that led to an article from October 17, 2017, published on a Nigerian online news and entertainment website called Kemi Filani News. The headline reads: “Viral photo of primary school pupils sleeping under the tree in Kwara state.”According to the brief report, the photo shows children from a local school in Mancha village, Edu, in Nigeria’s Kwara state.Similar articles were published in several Nigerian blogs and websites in the same year, such as Nigeria Newspaper, GistMania, and Nairaland.Another reverse image search result led to the Facebook page of the Ask The Paediatricians Foundation and a post by them on November 3, 2017, containing the same photo along with an appeal for donations to help renovate the school in Mancha village, Kwara state.“We need your support to get these children back to their classrooms!” reads part of the caption, which includes bank account details for donations.AFP Fact Check contacted Ask The Paediatricians Foundation, whose representatives confirmed their involvement in the fund-raising effort and supplied other images of the school, also available on their website, taken before and after the renovation work.The foundation, which focuses on children’s health and welfare through various outreach programmes, had renovated existing classrooms and provided furniture and stationery to the school in 2018.“When we saw the state of learning on the viral picture posted on Facebook ... of children in a school sitting and sleeping on a dirty muddy floor under a tree to learn, we just couldn't look away,” said the Lagos-based foundation’s Vera James in an email to AFP Fact Check. “Though it was a huge task for us at the time, we had to do something about it. It was disheartening seeing Nigerian children learning under such conditions. Beyond the fact that that was a very uncomfortable learning environment, it was also a source of several skin infections, which could be fatal to children's health and wellbeing.”“The project was commissioned in January 2018, with a medical outreach for over 500 hundred children in the community,"" James said. ""The outreach covered paediatric consultations, nutritional status checks, medications, healthy meal packs, among others.”",1
14,The girl in this outdated missing person’s alert was murdered six years ago,"A  recent post appealing for help to find a missing child pictured wearing a blue top and white shorts has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. However, the appeal is outdated; the girl in the picture went missing in 2014 in the US state of Alabama, and was later found dead. The image was used by her family in posters alerting the public to her disappearance.“She is missing, please pass this on and help find her,” reads the caption in this Facebook post published on October 17, 2020. The post includes a triptych  image of a young girl smiling at the camera, with an overlaid text that reads: “If you care she’s missing share!!""The post, which has since been shared more than 1,000 times, has received numerous comments expressing concern about the girl’s disappearance.The Facebook page behind the post, ""The National"", has 75,000 followers and  describes itself as a ""News & Media website"". According to Facebook's transparency section, the people managing the page are geolocated in Kenya.A reverse image search on Google revealed multiple news reports (see here and here) identifying the girl as eight-year-old Hiawayi Robinson, who went missing six years ago.Hiawayi disappeared on September 16, 2014, and was found dead two days later at an abandoned building in Prichard, Alabama. Autopsy reports indicated that she was sexually assaulted before being killed, leading to the arrest of her father, Hiawatha Robinson.He was sentenced in October 2016 to 100 years in prison for killing Hiawayi during a sexual assault.Hiawayi’s story was widely reported in the media (here, here and here) and it is in a documentary titled ""The Murder of Hiawayi Robinson"" that AFP Fact Check found the exact picture being shared in the misleading Facebook post.At the 9’29"" mark, Hiawayi’s mother and father are heard pleading to the public to help them find their daughter and a crowd standing behind them holding posters featuring the picture in question.The same poster in black and white can be seen in this report by Fox10 News.AFP Fact Check has debunked other false missing child alert posts here and here.",1
15,Rwandan government rejects old claim that French no longer an official language,"A Facebook post shared hundreds of times claims that Rwanda has dropped French as an official language and replaced it with Swahili. This is an old claim that was previously debunked by AFP Fact Check and has resurfaced. The Rwandan government confirmed that French remains one of the country’s four official languages.The claim was posted here on a public Facebook group called Africa for Africans on September 12, 2020. According to the post, “Rwanda removed French as official language & replaced it with Swahili”.The same post was shared here and here in recent weeks.Similar rumours also surfaced online in 2019, as we reported at the time.Rwanda has four official languages: Kinyarwanda, English, French and Swahili.According to the Constitution of Rwanda of 2003, revised in 2015, the national language is Kinyarwanda -- spoken primarily or exclusively by the vast majority of Rwandans -- and the official languages are Kinyarwanda, English, and French.In 2017, Swahili was added as an official language as part of commitments with the East African Community, an organisation whose three founders -- Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania -- use Swahili as their official language, alongside English.Government denialContacted by AFP Fact Check on October 6, 2020, Rwanda’s government spokesperson said French was still an official language, along with Kinyarwanda, English and Swahili.We also found no reports in reliable news media that the country had dropped French.French, the language of former colonial power Belgium, has been declining in use in Rwanda since the 1994 genocide, when a new political elite, dominated by anglophone Tutsi refugees, took charge.President Paul Kagame, himself Ugandan-educated, introduced English in 2003 as the third official language listed in the constitution, alongside Kinyarwanda and French.The country switched from French to English as a language of instruction in schools in 2008.But, two years ago Rwanda’s top diplomat told AFP that rejecting French was never the plan.“This is a misinterpretation, it was necessary for Rwanda to try to be part of this club of English-speaking countries,” former foreign minister Louise Mushikiwabo said in an interview in 2018.“The interpretation that suggests that Rwanda turned to English against French may have been the result of relations between France and Rwanda,” she said. “I think there was confusion between the relations of Rwanda and France, and the relations of Rwanda with the Francophonie.”In 2015, Rwanda counted some 700,000 French-speakers -- about six percent of the population -- according to the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF).",1
16,Manipulated image claims CNN reported imminent end to Ugandan leader’s long rule,"An image shared hundreds of times on Facebook claims to show a CNN broadcast reporting the imminent end to Uganda’s  “dictatorship” under long-serving President Yoweri Museveni, in favour of a political movement led by musician-turned-politician Bobi Wine. However, AFP Fact Check found the image is a hoax.“Uganda’s dictator Yoweri Museveni’s 33 year dictatorship is coming to an end, thanks to PeoplePower, a movement led by Robert Kyagulanyi (BobiWine) (sic),” reads the breaking news banner purportedly broadcast on CNN.The image, shared in this Facebook post, includes a headshot of the network’s news anchor Anderson Cooper and an inset of Wine.The opening line of the post reads: “Ugandans wake up if foreigners can notice this what about you the citizens of this country.”The same image was shared here on Facebook.Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni is expected to seek a sixth term in office next year after receiving the endorsement of his National Resistance Movement (NRM) party in June. The former rebel leader is facing a challenge from pop star Bobi Wine and his People Power movement.A reverse image search on Google found that the image of Anderson set against the blue backdrop is available on meme generator site Imgflip.The site features samples of other memes generated with the same template.In the Museveni posts, the headline font and spacing differ from CNN’s official style. The text also contains grammatical errors such as the conjoining of the names “Bobi Wine” and “People Power”.A search on CNN for the keywords “Yoweri Museveni” and “dictator” led to this report of Wine referring to Museveni as a dictator and asserting that the Ugandan leader must be ousted by the People Power movement.But while there have been other news reports labelling Museveni a dictator, the CNN visual was a hoax.AFP previously debunked another manipulated headline using Cooper’s on-air image.",1
17,These pictures do not feature children and were part of a protest against Trump’s immigration policy,"A post purporting to show children kept in cages by human traffickers has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. The claim is false; the images come from a campaign in the United States called “No Kids In Cages”, protesting against family separation among immigrants. Activists behind the campaign used mannequins as models.“We need to bring more awareness to these horrific tragedies,” reads a Facebook post shared more than 24,000 times since June 8, 2020. “Children are disappearing by the thousands I’m sure into child trafficking, sex Trafficking, Organ Harvesting, Cheap Labor, used for experimental drugs/ treatments...”Two images included in the post appear to depict children covered with foil blankets and held in steel cages.The post further claims that the minors are being kept in privately-owned facilities that are untraceable in the US.A reverse image search on Google located the two pictures in an article by Forbes entitled Disturbing Pop-Up Art Installations Depict Kids In Cages, which credits the images to a US-based immigration centre known as the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES).In June 2019 (as reported here and here) RAICES launched a public art activism project across New York City known as the #NoKidsInCages campaign, calling attention to the treatment of immigrant children at the US border.The campaign, which used sculptures to depict children huddled on the floor of a tiny cage and draped in a foil blanket, urged Americans to pressure legislators to pass the Keep Families Together Act in order to avoid children being separated from their families at the border.Zero-tolerance policyOn April 6, 2018, US President Donald Trump’s administration announced a “zero-tolerance policy” on immigrants aimed at prosecuting people entering the country illegally. The policy led to the forceful separation of children from their parents, with the adults and minors held in separate detention facilities. Criticism followed from lawmakers and human rights groups.Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley told CNN that he saw children being held in “wire-mesh, chain-linked cages” when he visited a detention center on the South Texas border.Days after announcing his policy, Trump signed an executive order rescinding forceful family separation, but a 2019 Human Rights Watch report indicated that migrant children were still being separated from their families at the border.#NoKidsInCagesThe #NoKidsInCages campaign emerged from these immigration realities in the US and the artistic works depicting children held in cages were intended to push for better legislation.The pictures have nothing to do with actual child trafficking as purported in the Facebook post.",1
18,Misleading Facebook post claims Bill Gates is making $200 billion from vaccine,"A video viewed thousands of times on Facebook claims that billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates admitted to making $200 billion from his charitable foundation’s investment in vaccines. The claim is misleading; the 26-second clip has been cut from a longer TV interview, where Gates estimated the global social and economic benefits from his foundation’s $10 billion investment. An official at the US think tank that calculated the $200 billion return on investment told AFP Fact Check that the claim was “an incorrect interpretation of the analysis”.“Bill Gates admits that he’s making $200 billion on his VAX (sic),” reads a Facebook post sharing the video, which we’ve archived here.The video is an extract from an interview Gates gave to CNBC journalist Becky Quick on January 23, 2019, in which he discussed the economic benefits of boosting vaccination rates. However, 16 seconds into the video, there is a cut creating a disconnect in Gate’s speech.The same edited video has also been shared on YouTube (here and here).However, the claim that Gates admitted to making $200 billion from vaccine investment is misleading.No mention of personal gainDuring the interview, Gates did not mention his personal gain, but rather discussed the social and economic benefits generated by his charitable foundation’s investment in vaccines.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has ploughed billions of dollars into making vaccines against diseases like polio, HIV and malaria. In June, it pledged $7.4 billion to global vaccines alliance Gavi to help immunisation programmes disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.AFP Fact Check ran a keyword search on Google for “Bill Gates $200 billion vaccine” and found various articles explaining where the figure comes from. In a Wall Street Journal article from January 16, 2019, entitled The Best Investment I’ve Ever Made, Gates explained the $10 billion investment made by his foundation in three global health organisations; Gavi, the Global Fund and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.“Suppose that our foundation hadn’t invested in Gavi, the Global Fund and GPEI and had instead put that $10 billion into the S&P 500, promising to give the balance to developing countries 18 years later. As of last week, those countries would have received about $12 billion, adjusted for inflation, or $17 billion if we factor in reinvested dividends,” he wrote.“What if we had invested $10 billion in energy projects in the developing world? In that case, the return would have been $150 billion. What about infrastructure? $170 billion. By investing in global health institutions, however, we exceeded all of those returns: The $10 billion that we gave to help provide vaccines, drugs, bed nets and other supplies in developing countries created an estimated $200 billion in social and economic benefits.”He said that the $200 billion return on investment had been calculated by the US non-profit think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center. According to its website, the organisation uses algorithms and data to analyse poverty-fighting strategies.‘Incorrect interpretation’David Lessmann, a spokesman at the Copenhagen Consensus Center, told AFP Fact Check that the misleading Facebook post “was an incorrect interpretation” of the estimate. He said the post wrongly suggested that “Gates will make or has made $200bn in cash from the Foundation’s contribution”.Lessmann explained that the figure estimated the return on investment by taking into account factors such as health care costs avoided by greater access to vaccines, income benefits from not falling sick or dying and the societal value of individuals created by reducing their risk of death.“None of the benefits measured by the report equate to a private windfall made by Mr Gates or any other contributor to the funds,” Lessmann said in an email. “The analysis identified that collectively across the three funds, the ROI (return on investment, editor’s note) was $20 per $1 spent. The benefit represents the social benefit of investments.”The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also told AFP Fact Check that the video clip had been taken out of context.“When we talk about return on investment (ROI) for vaccines, we mean lives saved and economic growth for the areas where the vaccines are made available,” the foundation said in an email.Gates has attracted numerous conspiracy theories around vaccines. AFP Fact Check has debunked some here and here.",1
19,These are old pictures unrelated to recent Sudan floods,"Various photos purporting to show recent flooding in Sudan have been shared hundreds of times online. However, AFP Fact Check found the images were circulating before the Sudan floods and taken in other countries.The photos have been shared more than 1,000 times on Facebook since September 6, 2020. They purport to show victims of catastrophic flooding in Sudan, which has triggered a state of emergency and affected at least 650,000 people since the start of rains in July.More than 110,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by floodwaters, according to the government, increasing the risk of water-borne diseases and hampering efforts to stem the spread of novel coronavirusOne of the photos circulating online, archived here, was posted on the Instagram page of Egyptian news site ElDostor, on September 6, 2020.The image shows a woman holding up an object above the water while swimming through heavy floods, with Arabic text written across that reads: “Sudanese woman holding up her medicines in the middle of floods”.The caption on the Instagram post reads “our hearts with our brothers in Sudan”.The picture has become one of the symbolic images of the floods in Sudan. An illustration based on the photo has also been widely shared on social media in posts expressing support for the victims of the disaster.The photo was shared on various Facebook pages, including here, here, and here, alongside the claim that it shows “the last photo of the Sudanese martyr who drowned in the floods”.However, the photo has nothing to do with recent floods in Sudan. AFP Fact Check ran a reverse image search and traced the picture to Getty Images stock photo archives. According to the caption, the photo was taken on July 31, 2013, and shows a woman swimming in floods in Panta, India.Man and childAnother photo was posted on Facebook here on September 7, 2020. It shows a man holding up a child on his shoulders in heavy floods.Part of the Arabic caption translates to: ""The picture is from the floods of Sudan, and we wish the people in Sudan safety.""A cartoon version of the same photo was published on the Facebook page of Jordanian TV channel, Roya on September 7, 2020. The caption reads: “From my heart, peace to Sudan, a hashtag trending on Twitter”. The post also includes a link to an article on their website about the floods in Sudan featuring the image.The photo was also shared on Facebook here, here, and here by people showing solidarity with the victims of the floods in Sudan.However, a reverse image search traced the photo to an article from October 30, 2007, about flooding in Cité Soleil, Haiti on the United Nations website. Thousands of people fled their homes due to a catastrophic storm that hit Haiti in 2007 and caused floods and major damages.Young girlAnother photo published on Roya’s Facebook page on September 9, 2020, shows a girl standing in front of tents in a flooded area. The Arabic caption translates to: “The brotherly Sudanese people are going through a disaster. Oh God, have mercy on this beautiful country and lift its good people from the harm that befell them and conceal them with good.”The same claim was posted on Facebook here and here.A reverse image search revealed that the same photo was published in an article on the website of the International Displacement Monitoring Center in May 2018.According to the article, the photo was taken in April 2018, Baidoa, Somalia. The UNHCR reports that the heavy river floods in the Southern region forced more than 280,000 people to flee their homes.People swimmingAnother photo posted on Facebook on September 9, 2020, shows two people swimming in a flooded residential area. The caption on the post claims the picture was taken in Sudan.The same photo was posted here, here, and here with the same claim.However, the same photo was found in an article from January 26, 2020, about flooding in Brazil on the website of British news channel Sky News. At least 45 people lost their lives because of the heavy rains that thrashed the southeast of the country over two days.Flooded streetsAnother photo circulating online was posted on September 11, 2020, and purports to show flooded streets in Khartoum, Sudan.The same photo was posted here, here, and here with similar claims.A reverse image search led to a photo of floods in the US city of New Orleans on August 29, 2005, published on the website of the US Department of Defense. The floods --  sparked by Hurricane Katrina, the deadliest storm in US history-- submerged about 80 percent of New Orleans.Elderly womanThis photo was published on Facebook on September 7, 2020. It shows a man carrying an elderly woman in a flooded area while other people are crossing the flooded streets. “Sudan floods 2020”, the caption readsThe photo was also posted on Facebook here with the same claim.However, the claim is false. The photo was already circulating online a month before the floods in Sudan. A reverse image search led to various articles on Palestinian news site Palestine Online on August 9, 2020, and on Egyptian news site Sada Al Balad  on August 10, 2020, showing floods in Ethiopia in August 2020.",1
20,Experts dismiss claim that holding your breath helps test for COVID-19,"A video purporting to be from an Indian hospital alleges you can find out if you have COVID-19 by simply holding your breath. But the claim is false; the WHO and a pulmonologist told AFP Fact Check that the technique cannot diagnose the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. The Indian hospital mentioned in the post has also denied any link to the video.The clip, which has drawn thousands of views including in India and Africa, alleges that the test involves holding your breath as a red dot moves from one point of a square to another.“If you can hold your breath as per the timing of the red dot moving from A to B, then you can be free of Corona,” reads the Hindi text on a video shared by a Facebook page managed from Palestine.“Breathe, relax, breathe,” it says. “Covid test only for 2,200 Indian Rupees (as per the rate fixed by Rajasthan government).”Included in the video’s information is a phone number for Ananta Hospital in the northwest of India.Similar posts were shared here, here and here.In Kenya and South Africa, the claim circulated on WhatsApp as a forwarded message reading: “If you can hold your breath till the red dot moves from A to B you are Covid 19 free at the moment. Simple covid test. Free Trial at no cost. Help Save a Life. Wait till the red dot moves to A before you start holding your breath (sic).”According to the claim, being able to hold your breath as the red dot takes about 25 seconds to move from one point to another is proof that your lungs are “healthy and disease-resistant”.However, the claim is false.The World Health Organization (WHO) told AFP Fact Check that the technique “does not tell you if you have COVID-19”.“This appears to be a simple app that measures time and not airflow. People with lung disease (from smoking, pollution, asthma, COPD or pulmonary infection, including but of course not limited to COVID-19) would have a harder time doing this.  It seems harmless, but not very informative, a crude measure of lung function,” WHO said in an email.Dr Peter Waweru, a pulmonologist in Nairobi, Kenya, also dismissed the claim, noting that a breathing test is not reliable when testing the presence or absence of the virus that causes COVID-19.“This is not accurate at all. Breathing cannot be used to test COVID-19. The lungs can have numerous infections and a breathing test is not sufficient to determine whether one has COVID-19 or not. We have seen people whose lungs have not been affected by the virus yet they have tested positive for COVID-19,” Waweru told AFP Fact Check.Dr Amba Lal Salve, a medical superintendent at Ananta Hospital, told AFP Fact Check in India that the institution was not behind the message on the video, which used legitimate information on Ananta Hospital’s Facebook page, including its phone number and the price of a COVID-19 test.“The video does not belong to the hospital and we have no idea who made it,” Salve said.AFP Fact Check previously explained the different tests used to diagnose COVID-19 here.",1
21,"This image shows a Zimbabwean man and his shoe collection, not Uganda’s president","A photo of a man in a room posing with numerous pairs of shoes on the floor has been shared on Facebook with claims that it shows Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni trying to appeal to young voters with a display of more than 100 pairs of sneakers. The claim is false; the image is old and shows Zimbabwean businessman Wicknell Chivayo showing off his personal shoe collection.The photo was posted on Facebook on August 10, 2020, with the caption: “President Museveni buys more than 100 pairs of sporty shoes that he'll be wearing as the Ugandan elections of 2021 approach, in an attempt to look trendy and connect with youthful voters.”The image in the post shows a man arranging dozens of pairs of casual shoes in neat rows.The photo was also posted with the same, and similar, claims on Facebook here, here, here and here, and on Twitter here.Again, the photo appeared in an article with a similar claim on Kenyan blog Bana, which publishes online news and entertainment. The headline reads: “Uganda president Yoweri Museveni buys more than 100 pairs of sporty shoes to lure youthful voters”.The article points to another report in Uganda’s Daily Monitor where it claims that Museveni, in addition to buying sporty sneakers, had also “procured flares” in order “to connect with youths” and win over young voters in next year’s elections. Despite efforts by AFP Fact Check as well as Pesa Check in this debunk, no evidence of such a report by the Daily Monitor was found.The claim that it is Museveni in the picture is, indeed, false.AFP Fact Check conducted a reverse image search that led to an article from October 31, 2017, published on a website called My Zimbabwe News. The headline reads: “Pompous Chivayo lambasted after posting photo of his shoes on social media”.The story describes the backlash against Wicknell Chivayo, a businessman from Zimbabwe, who used social media to flaunt his wealth and extensive shoe collection.An additional search on Chivayo’s Instagram account, where he goes by the name Sir Wicknell, led to a post from April 7, 2015, featuring the photo that was used in the false claim about Uganda's president.The caption reads: “... After praying I get into this dressing room, it's a headache again with more than 200 pairs of shoes which ones will I wear today, then lastly in the parking lot which car am I driving today...? ”.",1
22,This video does not show a Covid-19 patient who was nearly buried alive,"A video viewed thousands of times claims to show a Covid-19 patient in a Kenyan village who was “nearly buried alive” during his own funeral. The claim is false; county officials confirmed to AFP Fact Check that while the video was indeed taken during a burial ceremony, the man seen lying on the ground wearing protective gear had fainted and is a relative of the deceased.On August 23, a Facebook post that has since been viewed more than 40,000 times shared the video alongside the caption: “Meanwhile, in Kipsigis, a COVID patient was nearly buried alive. MoH has really bungled this pandemic and the best thing they could all do is resign (sic).”Kipsigis refers to the Nilotic group of people in Kenya’s Rift Valley region, while “MoH” refers to the ministry of health.In the three-and-a-half-minute recording, two people dressed in light blue personal protective equipment (PPE) are seen undressing a third person who is wearing the same protective gear and lying on the ground. It is not immediately clear what is happening from watching the video.Another Facebook post shared the same claim, adding that the incident happened in Rift Valley.“Kenya...Kenya...My Motherland. The Land That Buries her children alive. A COVID-19 patient almost buries alive in Rift Valley (sic),” the post reads.However, the claims are false.According to guidelines from Kenya’s ministry of health, corpses infected with Covid-19 are placed in tamper-proof body bags. In this video, however, the man claimed to be the deceased is wearing PPE and is not in a body bag.Stanley Mutai, the disaster management officer in Bomet County, which is located in Kenya’s Rift Valley region, told AFP Fact Check that while the clip was recorded during a burial ceremony in one of the villages, the claims about the deceased being discovered alive are false.“The claims are not true at all. We have been conducting burials of Covid-19 patients and lately, relatives have been requesting us to allow them to participate by carrying the coffin to the grave. At this particular funeral which took place in Chepkitwal village, one of the [families] made the request and as per standard procedure, one of the relatives had to wear the PPE,” said Mutai.“The PPE can be quite uncomfortable for someone who is not used to them and I think that is what led to the man fainting,” he added.Gilbert Korir, a county surveillance officer who was present during the burial, told AFP Fact Check that the man was taken to hospital after receiving first aid at the burial site.“This particular burial took place on August 13, 2020, and the man laying on the ground is definitely not the deceased. He fainted after we carried the coffin to the gravesite. The people helping to undress him are our public health officers on the ground, who also took him to the hospital,” Korir said.",1
23,"This video shows flooding in Mexico, not in Kenya","A video of cattle being swept away by floods has been shared a hundred times on Facebook, with a claim that it took place in West Pokot County in Kenya. However, the claim is false; the video shows floods in Mexico’s Nayarit state.This video was posted on Facebook on August 13, 2020. The caption on the post reads “West Pokot floods”.The same video was shared in other Facebook posts with similar claims here and here on the same date.However, the claim is false. By conducting a reverse image search on keyframes from the video using the WeVerify verification tool, AFP Fact Check found the same video posted on several Mexican news sites in July here, here, here and here.According to the news reports, the video shows cattle swept away by floods in Nayarit state in western Mexico. Due to heavy rains caused by Hurricane Hanna on July 27, 2020, the Zacualpan river overflowed, causing damage and loss of livestock.No flooding in West Pokot, KenyaMeanwhile, no floods have recently been reported for the county of West Pokot, Kenya, according to the Kenyan meteorological department’s assistant director, Dr. Richard Muita.“It has been raining upstream in the highland Baringo area. Therefore, Lake Baringo, around Nakuru and Rift Valley lakes are full, but there were no floods. There’s no heavy rain in the West Pokot area,” he added.",1
24,The World Health Organization has not been kicked out of Tanzania,"An article claiming that the Tanzanian government has kicked the World Health Organization (WHO) out of the country has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook. The claim is false; there is no evidence of any such directive and a WHO representative in Tanzania confirmed that the office is still operational.“Tanzania Kicks Out WHO After Goat & Papaya Samples Came COVID-19 Positive,” reads the headline on an article published by an Indian-based website called Great Game India, which describes itself as a “journal of geopolitics and international relations”.The article has attracted more than 15,000 interactions on Facebook, according to the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.Multiple Facebook posts (here, here, here and here) shared the article.“With the rise in false Coronavirus cases, the Tanzanian President John Magufuli, growing suspicious of the World Health Organization (WHO), decided to investigate the claims himself,” reads the article. “He sent the WHO samples of a goat, a papaya and a quail for testing. After all 3 samples came COVID-19 positive, the President is reported to have kicked out the WHO from the country.”In May, Magufuli questioned his own country’s coronavirus numbers after he said that he had secretly sent samples from a variety of animals, fruits and vehicle oil to be tested for COVID-19 at the national laboratory and that they came back positive.Magufuli claimed that there was “sabotage” and called on authorities to conduct investigations. He then suspended the head of the laboratory.WHO still operatingHowever, the article’s claim is false: the UN health agency’s office in Tanzania is still operational.“The World Health Organization has not been kicked out of Tanzania. Our office is still in operation,” WHO communications officer Collins Boakye-Agyemang told AFP Fact Check in an email.Tanzania’s Minister of Foreign Affairs,  Professor Palamagamba Kabudi, also dismissed the claims as “completely fake”.“Firstly, there is no relationship between the WHO and the results of the samples provided in the national laboratory. WHO representatives are not involved in testing at all,” Kabudi told AFP Fact Check in a phone call.“The relationship between Tanzania and WHO is very good and the representative is around as usual. That information is completely fake,” Kabudi added.Past tensionsLast year, the WHO issued a lengthy statement detailing how Tanzania had failed to provide information on suspected cases of Ebola in the country.In what was a rare rebuke, the UN health agency said it had not confirmed any case of Ebola in Tanzania, but raised concerns about the death of a person with suspected Ebola and contacts who had thereafter fallen ill.Tanzania dismissed the concerns about possible Ebola cases in the country as “rumours which everyone should ignore” and summoned WHO representatives for an explanation.Current operationsThis year, during the current coronavirus pandemic, Tanzania has not strictly enforced precautionary measures recommended by the WHO and other health bodies, such as wearing face masks and avoiding social gatherings. A claim that Tanzania had banned the use of face masks was debunked here by AFP Fact Check.The east African country has also not released any coronavirus infection data since April 29, 2020. By the last count, according to the World Health Organization, there had been 509 positive cases and 21 deaths.The WHO is currently providing Tanzania with technical support to fight the coronavirus pandemic.“WHO and a number of key partners continue to provide technical support to the Tanzanian government’s response to COVID-19 through its membership in various technical committees,” Boakye-Agyemang said.",1
25,Gas cylinders don’t have expiry dates printed on them,"Facebook posts claiming that liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders have coded expiry dates imprinted on them, making them a “time bomb” if stored in the house, have resurfaced online, attracting hundreds of shares. The claim is false; experts explain that the imprints are not expiry dates but future inspection dates that indicate when a cylinder should undergo testing to ensure it is safe for further use.“Do you know that the gas cylinder you live with in the kitchen is a time bomb, ready to explode any time,” reads a Facebook post from Nigeria, shared more than 180 times. The post was also shared in Kenya.It claims that every gas cylinder has an expiry date and those that have “expired” are unsafe to keep in the house. “The expiring date is coded on the side of the LPG Cylinder in alphabetical order, A,B,C,D in quarters (sic),” the post explains further.Each quarter is said to represent a three-month period (March, June, September and December) followed by a number to indicate the year of expiry.However, this numbering system is actually used to indicate a future date for routine inspection.Similar Facebook posts were shared here, here, here and here.The same claim was published on Youtube (in 2015) and on Twitter (in 2017).No expiry dateThe claim was dismissed in 2016 by the Indian Oil Corporation which noted that “there is no expiry date for LPG cylinders”.“The term expiry normally refers to the shelf life of perishable products which is the recommended time for safe storage and usage of such products within the time frame… As such there is no expiry date for LPG cylinders,” read the statement.A search online also revealed a news report published in 2017 by an Indian publication describing the claim as one that recurs annually in the Asian country.Michael Wasike, an engineer at Chemigas, a gas plant in Nairobi, told AFP Fact Check that unlike perishable products which have a shelf life, gas cylinders undergo inspections to make sure that they adhere to the set safety standards.“In Kenya, the cylinders are supposed to be used in the market for eight years, then they are supposed to be inspected afresh,” Wasike said in a phone interview.David Tyler, the director of France-based World Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association (WLPGA), explained in an email to AFP Fact Check that during their periodic inspections, gas cylinders undergo “visual checks for dents, corrosion etc., a date check to ensure the cylinder is not due for requalification, and a tare weight check to ensure the correct amount of LPG is filled into the cylinder”.What do the codes mean?The Indian Oil Corporation explained in its press statement that the codes imprinted with letters and numbers indicate the next due date for each cylinder to undergo testing or inspection. It does not mean the cylinder automatically expires, nor does it make the gas bottle a “time bomb”.“Cylinders marked A 2017 means that they are due for testing in the first quarter (between January and March) of the year 2017. Similarly, B 2017 means that they are due for testing in the second quarter (between April and June) of the year 2017. Similarly C (between July and September) is for the third quarter and D (between October and December) for the fourth quarter,” reads the press release.Safety precautionsNonetheless, Tyler cautioned that consumers need to be careful when handling LPG cylinders at home and to ensure the regulator has been fitted correctly to the valve and that it, as well as the hose and appliance, are in good condition.“Consumers should also make sure there are no leaks by checking all joints with soapy water and – most importantly – ensure there is adequate ventilation for complete combustion,” said Tyler.AFP Fact Check previously debunked a claim that gas cylinders explode if shaken.",1
26,Post claiming to show Beirut blast aftermath also features unrelated photos,"A Facebook post claiming to show the devastating aftermath of two blasts in Beirut has been shared hundreds of times in Kenya. However, some of the images are old and in fact, show scenes from attacks in the Lebanese capital dating as far back as 2007.On August 4, 2020, two massive explosions ravaged Beirut's port, leaving more than 100 people dead and thousands injured.As reported by AFP, Prime Minister Hassan Diab said that 2,750 tonnes of the agricultural fertiliser ammonium nitrate -- stored for years in a portside warehouse -- had blown up, sparking ""a disaster in every sense of the word"".A Facebook post shared on a Kenyan Facebook page published multiple photographs purportedly showing the aftermath of the incident with the caption: ""A moment of silence for the Lebanese Nationals... so sad"".However, reverse image searches revealed that while some of the pictures were indeed taken following Tuesday's explosions, others were old photos of attacks in Beirut.The image showing a man carrying a little boy across rubble was actually taken in 2012 following the explosion of a car bomb in Beirut.We located the picture in several reports including here and here. It was snapped by an Associated Press (AP) photographer and is featured on the news agency’s website here.The picture showing rescuers wheeling away an injured person is not recent either. It was captured in 2007 during another explosion in Beirut targeting Christian lawmaker Antoine Ghanem.The photo was used in a report here and can be found on AP’s website here.The photo showing two men running away from a burning car was taken in 2013 during a double explosion at the Iranian Embassy compound in Beirut. The picture can be found on AP’s site here.Recent imagesNine of the images shared in the post showed actual scenes from the August 4, 2020  blast taken by AFP (here, here, here, here, here and here) and AP (here, here and here).The last image in the post is a montage that includes two screengrabs from an interview that Beirut governor Marwan Abboud gave shortly after the blast, in which he can be seen crying, as well as a photo of the rubble from the European Press Agency.",1
27,"Ongoing COVID-19 infections are detected with a viral test, not a blood check for antibodies","Widely shared social media posts claim the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that positive COVID-19 results simply mean people have previously contracted a cold. In reality, the claim is a misinterpretation of a paragraph discussing antibody tests on the CDC's website. Health experts say ongoing COVID-19 infections are detected with viral tests, not an analysis of antibodies.“SHOCKER: CDC admits COVID-19 ‘positive result’ just means you've previously contracted the common cold,” one Facebook post says.Similar Facebook posts have been shared South Africa here and in the US archived here and here.This Polish Facebook post shared a screenshot of the actual paragraph from the CDC's website. The caption translates to: ""American CDC reports that a positive test result (allegedly for COVID-19) could mean that you had any other cold or flu caused by other coronaviruses"".The screenshot used in the post can be found on the CDC website under the topic: “Test for Past Infection (Antibody Test)”.But health experts say the social media posts have misinterpreted the paragraph -- including Kenyan doctor Githinji Gitahi, a board member of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The institution is part of the African Union and unrelated to the American CDC.Gitahi, who also runs the medical NGO Amref Health Africa, told AFP Fact Check there are two types of tests for COVID-19 -- the direct or viral test, and the indirect test, also referred to as the antibody test.Blood samples are used to check for traces of antibodies, which indicate if someone was previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes COVID-19.The viral test, meanwhile, uses samples from the respiratory system, such as a swab from the inside of your nose, throat or lungs to detect an ongoing COVID-19 infection.""Since there is currently no antibody test that is specific to antibodies produced to fight SARS-CoV-2, there is a likelihood to test positive if one tests for antibodies but it might not be because of COVID-19 but because the antibodies came from other coronaviruses, even the one that causes the common cold,"" Gitahi said.“Because of this confusion, we do not use the antibody test to confirm COVID-19 infection but we use the viral test, which is conducted in the nose or throat with swabs or in the lungs.”The US-based CDC told AFP Fact Check that a viral test will not produce a positive result for COVID-19 from the traces of other human coronaviruses.""The viral test detects the SARS-CoV-2 virus in respiratory samples. The presence of other human coronaviruses in a respiratory sample do not produce a positive result on a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2,"" spokeswoman Jasmine Reed said in an email.""A positive result on an antibody test might mean that a person had a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. But there is a small chance that antibodies from an infection with a different coronavirus, such as the one that causes the common cold, might cause a positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 antibody test.""WHO acknowledges that antibody tests such as serology testing can be used in COVID-19  surveillance to measure the extent of infection in the population.But it cautions against the uncertainty of the test in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and its ability to “assess cross-reactivity” with other coronaviruses.",1
28,"WHO dismisses fake COVID-19 job ads, warns of similar scams","A message shared on WhatsApp and Facebook claims that the World Health Organization (WHO) is advertising home-based jobs to ""fight coronavirus” and says no experience is necessary. However, there is no such employment offer from the UN health agency, which has warned the public of similar scams.The message circulating on WhatsApp chat groups in South Sudan, Kenya and Uganda claims that the advertised jobs pay $5 to $100 for two to three hours of work each day using a mobile phone.“Help us fight CORONAVIRUS by working from home - no experience required... Work 2-3 hours daily on mobile and earn $5- $100 daily,” the message reads.It includes a link to a web page where people are invited to apply. The application form asks users for their personal information and requires the post to be shared on WhatsApp with at least 14 other people and chat groups. The deadline is stated as July 31, 2020.The same claim is circulating on Facebook here, here, here and here.Job offer is a scamHowever, the claim is false. The WHO in Uganda issued a statement on its official Facebook page on June 11, 2020, warning the public “to disregard” the job advert “because it’s FAKE”.All WHO jobs are posted on the official WHO website, it said.The post also misspells the WHO's name, using an ""s"" instead of a ""z"" in ""Organization"".A search on the WHO's website also shows no mention of the so-called job advert circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook.On its cyber-security page, the organisation warns about hackers and scammers using social media and malicious online links to take advantage of people during the COVID-19 pandemic.As part of its public guidance, the WHO says it will:",1
29,Images claiming to show recent snowfall in Kenya are old and actually depict hail,"Multiple images claiming to show snowy weather in some parts of Kenya have been shared hundreds of times in online posts. However, a reverse image search shows that the pictures are old. While some regions are currently experiencing cold weather, an official at the national meteorological department told AFP Fact Check that no snow has been sighted.In its monthly weather outlook, Kenya's weather department predicted that for July, “cool/cold and cloudy/foggy conditions with occasional light rains/drizzles are expected to prevail over the Central Highlands, Nairobi County and the Central and South Rift Valley”.On July 20, 2020, this Facebook post shared a picture of a road covered with what appeared to be snow, claiming the scene was pictured in Kijabe, a town about 50 kilometres north-west of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.“EUROPE HAS COME TO KENYA! It snowed this morning in NYAHURURU. Spectacular views... Climate change is real,” reads another  Facebook post published on July 21, 2020.The same images were shared on this Twitter account, which has more than 150,000 followers, alongside the caption: “Unusually cold conditions across the country. Winter in Nyandarua?”Old picturesAll the images used in the multiple posts are, however, old; a reverse image search on TinEye located some of them in a news report by Citizen TV, a local media station, published on July 5, 2017.According to the report,  the images were captured in Nyahururu, Laikipia county, an area located on the equator in the Great Rift Valley.A search of the keywords “Nyahururu, snow” on Google for the year 2016 and 2017 led us to a tweet published by Kenya’s meteorological department on July 4, 2017, commenting on the “snow images”  that were circulating online.“The event in Nyahururu is a hail storm. Such storms occur when there is abrupt convection and rain clouds form too fast,” reads the tweet. “For it to snow temperatures are usually below 0°C”.The event in Nyahururu is a hail storm. Such storms occurs when there is abrupt convection and rain clouds form too fast.In a phone interview with AFP Fact Check, Richard Muita, a director at Kenya’s meteorological department, explained that the images show hail and not snow.“We would actually call it hail because they are big rocks coming from the atmosphere then falling on the ground and covering some area. We do not have snow in Kenya, this is not a characteristic of the tropical area and more research is needed to establish whether there is a relationship with the changes in climate.”However, he added that snowy conditions are experienced in highland areas like the Aberdare mountain range, north of Nairobi, and atop Mount Kenya.No recent reports of snowMuita confirmed that the weather department has not received any reports of snow-like weather in 2020.“Lately, we have not seen that kind of thing. Currently what we are seeing in colder regions in Kenya is foggy conditions in the morning and this clears off as the day progresses. Also what you can see in those colder or foggy areas is a bit of water on top of crops and vegetation but not snow per se,” Muita told AFP Fact Check.Between July 14 and July 20, Nyahururu recorded the lowest temperatures countrywide at 8.7 degrees Celsius (47.7 degrees Fahrenheit).Snow forms when the atmospheric temperature is at or below freezing, but by reviewing 2020 data from the meteorological department, there are no day temperatures in Kenya that have been at or below 0 degrees Celsius.",1
30,No banning order issued ending the use of face masks in Tanzania,"An article claiming that Tanzania has banned the wearing of face masks to guard against the new coronavirus because they “caused anxiety among Tanzanians” has re-emerged in South Africa after first circulating online in May 2020. According to the piece, which has received thousands of interactions on Facebook, the order was issued by Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli. However, this claim is false; no such order was issued, and a government spokesperson has urged citizens to observe guidelines issued by experts to safeguard against COVID-19.An article headlined “African Country Bans Face Masks – Also Reopen Schools And Shops” was published on a site called Reporting the News on May 27, 2020. According to data from the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, it garnered more than 187,000 Facebook interactions, including more than 27,000 shares.A similar article titled “Kwaheri Corona (Goodbye Corona): Magufuli bans use of face masks in Tanzania” was published two days earlier on this Kenyan website.The two sites quoted a letter allegedly issued to the press by President John Magufuli’s office.Translated from Swahili, it reads: “The President of Tanzania His Excellency Dr John Pombe Magufuli on May 24, 2020, has banned the use of face masks because it is creating anxiety among the citizens leading to the closure of businesses across the country. The president has also allowed public vehicles to resume to normal operations and carry passengers as per the maximum capacity as before. He has also directed the opening of schools.” The letter uses the signature of Gerson Msigwa, who is the director of presidential communication.The claim was shared in multiple Facebook posts here, here and here.However, Magufuli has made no such announcement banning face masks -- neither at the time this claim emerged in May nor since.A search of the press releases listed on the presidency’s official websites did not reveal any such letter sent to newsrooms, nor did any Tanzanian media outlets report on this.On May 24, 2020, Msigwa discredited the letter attributed to him on social media, stamping it as “fake” on his official Twitter account.pic.twitter.com/MScChnuPdxAt the same time, Tanzanian government spokesperson Hassan Abbasi, while responding to a similar claim of a ban on face masks captured in a screenshot taken from a tweet (and passed off as an order by Magufuli), labelled it as “fake”.“This is fake and should be ignored. Let’s continue observing guidelines from our health experts to protect ourselves as well as protecting others,” Abbasi tweeted in Swahili.While Magufuli did not issue the claimed banning order, Tanzania has not strictly enforced precautionary measures against COVID-19 such as wearing face masks and avoiding social gatherings. The Tanzanian leader is on record encouraging citizens to gather in places of worship as well as declaring the country free of COVID-19 thanks to prayers,  as reported here and here.“I believe that corona (sic) has been eradicated from Tanzania through the power of our God. And we thank Him very much… Today I don’t see anyone wearing a face mask,” Magufuli said during a church service amid cheers.In another gathering, as reported here by AFP, Magufuli urged Tanzanians to pray and not depend on face masks for protection.What about public transport?Magufuli has not issued any directives allowing public transport to return to normal, which in Tanzania means carrying passengers above full capacity.In March, the Transport Regulatory Authority instructed the public transport sector to limit passengers to the number of seats available, while the last directive from former Dar es Salaam regional commissioner Paul Makonda, who stepped down on July 15, 2020, allowed buses to add four students more than the number of seats, therefore allowing four passengers to stand.Meanwhile, all primary and secondary schools in Tanzania resumed academic sessions on June 29, 2020, following a directive by Magufuli.",1
31,Scientists warn against 'bogus' COVID-19 removal cards,"South Sudan's president and senior ministers have appeared in public in recent weeks wearing so-called “virus removal cards”, clip-on tags marketed as prevention against infectious diseases. AFP Fact Check found the items for sale online in various countries, including Lebanon, Malaysia and the Philippines. However, scientists warn the cards, which have been banned in the US and elsewhere, do not prevent COVID-19.Several top officials in South Sudan including President Salva Kiir have appeared wearing blue or green “virus removal cards” in recent weeks. Kiir was spotted wearing two brands, Virus Removal Card and Air Doctor, during a meeting at the statehouse on May 19, 2020.A few days earlier, First Vice President Riek Machar was photographed on May 15, 2020, wearing an Air Doctor card during a meeting with the US ambassador to South Sudan.Another top official, Hussain Abdelbagi Akol, also appeared sporting an Air Doctor tag during a speech on May 20, 2020, announcing measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Defence Minister Angelina Teny also wore an Air Doctor card during an address to troops on May 16, 2020.Machar, Teny and Akol were among several government officials wearing the cards who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19.South Sudan, which is emerging from a devastating six-year civil war, has so far recorded more than 1,920 cases of COVID-19 and 36 deaths, according to an AFP tally on June 24, 2020.Last month, officials announced the virus had reached a camp of some 30,000 displaced people who have been seeking United Nations protection in the capital Juba since 2013.Some South Sudanese citizens expressed scepticism of the tags on social media, with some branding them a “scam”, while others warned they could even help spread the virus.Manufacturers claim that virus removal cards can kill bacteria and viruses thanks to their key ingredient, chlorine dioxide, a disinfectant used to treat drinking water and sterilise medical equipment.According to Air Doctor, the tags “eliminate all forms of microbial life” and provide “ultimate protection against airborne infection diseases”, including for children, pregnant women and immuno-compromised people such as cancer patients.The product is sold under various commercial names, including Air Doctor, Virus Shut Out and Chlorine Card.AFP Fact Check found the cards for sale online for around $18 to $25 in various countries, including Lebanon and the Philippines, while the Air Doctor tag is available on Amazon in Japan. An advert on Malaysian site Shopee described the Virus Shut Out tag as “Covid best defense” (sic).The product has been marketed as a flu treatment in Japan since at least 2015, long before the novel coronavirus emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan. However, the Japanese consumer affairs agency (in Japanese) on May 15, 2020 warned the public that the product was ineffective against COVID-19.The card has been banned in several countries this year, including in the US, Thailand and the Philippines.Various scientists told AFP Fact Check that virus removal cards are ineffective as protection against COVID-19 or any other illness.“This product is bogus and should be banned from use anywhere in the world."" - Robert Sarafino, infectious disease expertRobert Sarafino, a consultant in infectious diseases and microbiology at Barts Health hospitals in London, said the cards were ineffective.“This product is bogus and should be banned from use anywhere in the world,” he told AFP Fact Check.“SARS-COV2 is inactivated by direct application of the disinfectant on the contaminated surface and for a certain duration of time. This product alleges that it protects against the virus inactivating in the air. It does not state the concentration of the disinfectant within this product,” he said.""Those cards are not proven anywhere in the world. There is no scientific evidence that they are effective, neither on viruses nor bacteria."" - Charles Ochero, infectious disease specialistCharles Ochero, an infectious diseases and microbiology specialist at The University of Edinburgh, said he did not recommend the cards.“Those cards are not proven anywhere in the world. There is no scientific evidence that they are effective, neither on viruses nor bacteria,” he said.The World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly warned against untested products marketed as drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. In March, the WHO said it had come across “a growing number of falsified medical products that claim to prevent, detect, treat or cure COVID-19” in various countries.Mark Ajak, an independent researcher in infectious diseases at the University of Western Australia, told AFP Fact Check that the tags use internal fans to filter the air. This is aimed at removing airborne objects including bacteria and viruses and recycling the air.But while the virus cards may catch larger particles from the air such as dander, he said they were ineffective against COVID-19 because the novel coronavirus was too tiny to be captured by the device.The virus removal card concept is based on “air purifiers that can clear the air from agents that cause respiratory problems or diseases in order to improve the quality of the space that is being occupied by people, but these air purifiers cannot kill viruses because of their size,” said Ajak, who has also worked for the South Sudanese health ministry.“COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person and the only way to limit the spread is by fighting the spread using strong antiseptic or detergents through a strict hygiene practice.”He warned that the card could potentially even prove “very harmful”.“Virus-removing cards... contain chlorine oxide, which is effective on surfaces but it is very harmful on the respiratory system. It can lead to severe respiratory and eye irritations and skin burns because it is very corrosive”.",1
32,Viral Facebook posts combine two different speeches Obama gave in 2016,"A post shared thousands of times in different languages purports to show former US president Barack Obama crying at an anti-racism conference, with some saying he spoke after the fatal US arrest of George Floyd. In reality, the clip is a montage of two separate speeches Obama gave about gun control while he was still president.The emotional footage starts with a moment of silence before former US president Barack Obama breaks down in tears. According to the caption with the video, America’s first black president was reacting to the death of George Floyd during a public address.“Former American President OBAMA could not hold back his tears during the press conference on racist violence in this case that which resulted in the death of the African-American, George Floyd (sic),” reads one of the posts written in French.The clip has been viewed more than 100,000 times and attracted more than 2,000 shares since it was posted on May 30, 2020.Meanwhile, a Facebook post in English viewed more than 20 million times made this claim with the video: “Obama shed tears during a press conference to address racism against black people in America”.A similar post has been viewed more than half-a-million times.The viral clip surfaced amid worldwide outrage over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder after he was filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes before he died.While Obama posted a video addressing Floyd’s death, the montage circulating online is not linked to the killing which has sparked demonstrations against racism and police violence in the United States and Europe.The 44th president of the United States also issued a statement on his official Twitter account denouncing Floyd's death.My statement on the death of George Floyd: pic.twitter.com/Hg1k9JHT6RTwo different speechesThe first 25 seconds of the montage is a speech where Obama is heard saying: “Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.”A Google search for the keywords “Obama crying” reveals this video, containing the same clip, on American news channel CNN.Obama delivered the speech at the White House in 2016 while condemning gun violence in the US and unveiling new gun control measures. During his speech, Obama shed tears as he remembered 20 first graders who were among those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, when a gunman rampaged through the school.Obama did not talk about racism in this address.The second part of the montage starts with Obama saying: “We cannot turn away and simply dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid.”A Google search of these exact words reveals they are from Obama’s speech on July 12, 2016, during a memorial service for five Dallas police officers shot dead during a protest against police shootings of black men.The gunman is thought to have deliberately targeted white police officers during the attack.At the memorial service, Obama extensively talked about racism and protests then called for reconciliation, urging Americans to “reject despair” and “break a dangerous cycle”.Although the two speeches address violence and racism, they do not have any link to the death of George Floyd.",1
33,Business grant scam in Uganda resurfaces on Facebook,"A Facebook post claiming that the Ugandan government is offering grants to local businesses in an effort to cushion its citizens against the effects of COVID-19 has been shared hundreds of times. The claim is false; the Facebook post appears on a page impersonating Uganda’s finance ministry. The ministry has flatly denied partnering with any organisation for purposes of offering grants to Ugandan entrepreneurs in the ongoing pandemic.This post published on a Facebook page called “Ministry of finance, planning and economic development, Uganda” on May 29, 2020, claimed to be offering a grant to Ugandan entrepreneurs.“GOOD NEWS TO ALL UGANDAN ENTREPRENEURS. The Ministry has partnered with USAID, BACC and other International bodies in giving out GRANTS to all deserving citizens to boost your business during this time. I urge all to grab this chance,"" reads the post shared more than 200 times.It also provides a link to an application form, which requires applicants to provide personal details, such as name, phone number, email address and physical location, as well as the estimated cost of the business project they want to undertake.Virtually all Facebook users who commented on the post appeared to believe that the grant was genuine, with many thanking the government.Uganda’s ministry of finance issues warningShortly after the Facebook post surfaced, the ministry of finance issued a warning on its Facebook page, confirming that the government was not offering such a grant.“Do not be conned during this #Covid-19 lockdown period by online fraudsters using this fake Facebook account below. The Ministry of Finance has not partnered with any organisation for purposes of offering grants to Ugandan entrepreneurs,” the post reads.The false page bears the same name --  ‘Ministry of finance, planning and economic development, Uganda’ -- as the official Facebook page of the ministry of finance.However, the ‘Page transparency’ section of the Facebook page reveals that it is managed from Kenya and was created on February 6, 2019, whereas the finance ministry’s genuine account is managed from Uganda and was created years earlier, on October 12, 2011.We can also find a link to the finance ministry’s genuine Facebook page on the homepage of its website.Last year, AFP Fact Check debunked similar posts from another imposter Facebook account going by the same name, also managed from Kenya.Economy and COVID-19 in UgandaUgandan President Yoweri Museveni has called on local businesses to ramp up local production in the wake of a drop in importations due to the pandemic.In March, Museveni announced that his government was deliberating on setting up a fund with the Ugandan Development Bank (UDB), in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to accelerate industrialisation in the East African country.Additionally, Uganda’s central bank has announced credit relief measures in a bid to salvage the economy from the effects of COVID-19. The measures include extending loan repayment periods and reducing interest rates on loans.However, there is no announcement that the government is offering grants to business amid the global pandemic.",1
34,No evidence Rwanda’s president ordered 18 Chinese nationals to leave the country,"Posts claiming that Rwandan President Paul Kagame ordered the deportation of  Chinese nationals for mistreating Rwandan workers have been shared hundreds of times on Facebook. However, there is no public record of such an order, and representatives of both the Rwandan and Chinese governments said this never happened.According to a Facebook post published by a page called “CNN Zambia”, 18 Chinese nationals were “sent packing back to China” on May 27, 2020, after President Paul Kagame allegedly discovered that they were mistreating Rwandan workers and grabbing their land.The post also includes a long quote attributed to Kagame, which reads, in part: “This country is for Africans and those who mean well for us. I’m instructing those 18 Chinese nationals to go back and never return back!”The transparency section of the Facebook page reveals that it was first created on May 2, 2020, under the name Bally News, then changed to CNN Zambia on May 23, 2020. The page is not verified -- unlike others belonging to the American news channel CNN.Similar Facebook posts were shared here and here, while on YouTube the same claim was circulated in videos here and here.The claim also appeared on a website called Zambian Observer, which has frequently published misinformation. (See AFP’s previous debunks here, here and here.)No deportation orderThere are no reports from any reputable media organisations of Kagame making such a statement. A Rwandan government spokesperson told AFP Fact Check the claim was “fake news”.And in response to a Zimbabwean politician who tweeted the claim, Kagame's media adviser, Yolande Makolo, warned that the reports were false.Hon. Mliswa, please note that this is fake news - never happened.  June 3, 2020, the foreign affairs ministry also issued a statement on Twitter asking the public to ignore the claims.""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation would like to inform the public that there has been fake news circulating on various social media platforms stating that 18 Chinese citizens were expelled from Rwanda; no such thing happened. Please ignore,"" reads the statement.The Chinese embassy in Rwanda confirmed to AFP Fact Check that claims about the deportation were, indeed, wrong.“Chinese embassy didn't receive any info about this fabricated deportation. Total fake news”, a representative of the Chinese embassy in Rwanda wrote.Reports of Chinese nationals mistreating local workers in Africa are not new. In February, Kenya’s interior minister ordered the deportation of four Chinese nationals who were accused of assaulting a Kenyan restaurant worker. The scene, which was captured on video, caused outrage on social media.",1
35,Interpol has not released a report on cybercrime hotspots in Kenya,"A post claiming that Interpol has identified a  small town on the outskirts of Nairobi as a cybercrime hotspot has attracted hundreds of interactions on Facebook. The claim is false: Interpol has confirmed it has released no such data and AFP has traced the original story to a satirical website.On May 18, 2020, Kenyan television station NTV broadcast a story about Interpol naming the town of Juja as a cybercrime hotspot. The media outlet also promoted its TV report on Facebook and Twitter. The posts featured screenshots of the TV story with the strapline ""Juja: A Cyber Crime Hot-Spot"".A Google search for the keywords “Interpol Juja cybercrime hotspot” revealed this article published on a website called PostaMate on May 15, 2020 -- three days before NTV aired its report.A tagline on the frontpage clearly identifies PostaMate as a satirical website.While Kenya police on May 14, 2020 confirmed the arrest of two university students in Juja over cybercrimes , Interpol told AFP Fact Check it had not released a report about cybercrimes in Kenya or identified Juja as a hotspot.“We can confirm that we have not released a statement claiming this. From additional reports we have seen, this claim appears to have originated from a satirical website,” Interpol’s Press office said in an email.“The Interpol General Secretariat does not normally issue such public reports.”A search on Interpol’s website did not reveal any cybercrime report in Kenya. In fact, the last such website report dates back to February, 17 2020 and was about Southeast Asia.Cybercrime in KenyaThere has been a rise of cyber-related criminal activities in Kenya and a report by the country’s  Communication Authority (CA) indicates that about 37.1 million cyber threats were detected between October and December 2019. The four main threats were categorised as malware, botnet, web application attacks and system vulnerabilities.CA estimates that the number of cybercriminals in the country lies between 16,000 and 17,000.AFP Fact Check Kenya has debunked several online scams here and here.",1
36,The World Bank did not praise Tanzania’s anti-coronavirus policies,"Articles claiming the World Bank has applauded Tanzania’s anti-coronavirus policies have been widely shared, with one attracting thousands of interactions on Facebook. The publications claim the East African country was singled out for praise in a report for implementing “unique policies” in the fight against the novel coronavirus. But the report does not include any such mention and the World Bank has denied specifically highlighting Tanzania’s COVID-19 response.The claim started circulating on April 13, 2020, in an article published by Ugandan daily tabloid Red Pepper. The story was titled ""World Bank Applauds Tanzania on Anti Corona Policy Response, Warns African Countries Copying Western Anti-COVID19 Policies in Report"".It alleges that the World Bank ""commended Tanzania as one of the best examples for its strategic approaches that considers the best of its political economy and well-being of the society"", in the latest version of its biannual Africa's Pulse report.Red Pepper’s article attracted over 5,000 interactions on Facebook, according to the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.On April 14, 2020, two Tanzanian newspapers -- Tanzania Perspective and the Times Observer -- printed articles headlined “World Bank applauds Tanzania on anti COVID-19 policy” and “WB applauds JPM on COVID-19 response”, respectively. JPM refers to Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli.The articles, which also made reference to the Africa’s Pulse report, claimed Tanzania was recognised for implementing unique policies to cushion the economy instead of copy-pasting what countries in the West were doing.The claim has also been shared in Facebook posts here and here.While countries across Africa have taken stringent measures to fight COVID-19  such as curfews and partial or full lockdowns, Tanzania has  taken a lighter approach.While schools have been closed and sports events scraped, Tanzania’s president has encouraged gathering in places of worship, as reported by AFP.“This is (the) time to build our faith and continue praying to God and not depending on face masks. Don't stop going to churches and mosques for prayers. I'm sure this is just a change of wind and it will go like others have gone,"" Magufuli said last month during a church service in Dodoma. He later reiterated this message during a Good Friday address.As Magufuli continues to encourage citizens to go on with most of their normal activities to sustain the economy, opposition leaders have criticised him for not taking a stricter stance in curbing the global pandemic.Did the World Bank applaud Tanzania’s policies?AFP reviewed the World Bank’s Africa’s Pulse report and did not find any specific praise for Tanzania’s COVID-19 response.Africa’s Pulse is a biannual publication containing an analysis of the near-term macroeconomic outlook for the region.In a statement, the World Bank unequivocally denied singling out Tanzania’s policy in its assessment of the economic impact of COVID-19 and policy responses in Sub-Saharan Africa.“Our attention has been drawn to news articles currently circulating in Tanzania and on various other websites regarding the World Bank’s recent economic update for Sub-Saharan Africa. On Thursday, April 9, the World Bank launched Africa’s Pulse, its regional economic update, in which the institution highlighted the significant impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on the region’s economy and on the welfare of citizens, and offered recommendations on the appropriate actions that governments may need to consider,” the statement said.“In this report, the World Bank does not make specific mention or assessment of Tanzania’s COVID-19 response.”The report recommends that African countries should customise their COVID-19 responses to fit the structural features of their economies. For instance, it warns that actions such as strict confinement might not work effectively in economies that heavily rely on the informal sector -- where the majority of the population needs to work every day to sustain their livelihoods.",1
37,Kenya governor quotes non-existent WHO research to defend alcohol donations,"A video of Nairobi governor Mike Sonko claiming the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends drinking alcohol to help prevent the new coronavirus is circulating online. The claim is false; the WHO has, in fact, warned the public against excessive alcohol consumption during the pandemic.Sonko made the remarks during a press briefing where he justified the inclusion of bottles of Hennessy cognac in food donations to city dwellers during the partial lockdown.“I think from the research which has been conducted by the World Health Organization and various health organisations, it has been revealed that alcohol plays a very major role in killing the coronavirus or any sort of virus,” Sonko says in the press briefing.“If you take any sanitiser and check the alcoholic content, you will find each sanitiser has above 70 percent of alcohol content... Hennessy has some percentage of alcoholic content, that should act as a throat sanitiser. It kills the virus just in case the virus is held somewhere in the throat. So the Hennessy which are there, I am giving them to adults and not any person below 18-years of age”.“We will have some small bottles of Hennessy in the food packs that we will be giving to our people…” - Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko
		Note: WHO warns that drinking alcohol does not protect you against COVID-19 and can be dangerous pic.twitter.com/vuSuVAb8dyThe governor’s remarks came days after he was criticised online when photos of his food donation packages to poor city dwellers revealed that he had included bottles of Hennessy.On April 6, 2020, Kenya banned all movement in and out of Nairobi for a period of 21 days in a bid to contain the virus.Health warningThere is no research by the WHO indicating that drinking alcohol kills COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. On April 14, 2020, the agency released a statement encouraging governments to enforce measures to limit alcohol consumption.“WHO/Europe reminds people that drinking alcohol does not protect them from COVID-19,” the statement reads.The organisation also warned against excessive alcohol consumption during lockdown, which it says can exacerbate problems including domestic violence and mental health issues.Hennessy has also denied the Nairobi governor’s claims in a statement seen by AFP.“Our attention has been drawn to a video circulating across different media channels on Tuesday, April 14, 2020, alleging that the consumption of Hennessy helps to fight against COVID-19. Hennessy would like to stress that the consumption of our brand or any other alcoholic beverage does not protect against the virus,” reads the statement signed by Hennessy’s manager in Kenya, Anne-Claire Delamarre.Although the WHO recommends the use of alcohol-based sanitiser (also known as rubbing alcohol) to wash hands, the alcohol found in this product is different from that found in liquor, beer and wine.Serkalem Mekonnen, a poison specialist at the National Capital Poison Center in Washington DC, explains in this article that rubbing alcohol -- which can be toxic if inhaled -- contains isopropyl alcohol, while alcohol found in liquor is known as ethanol or ethyl alcohol.AFP has debunked other coronavirus related myths here.",1
38,How to spot COVID-19 misinformation on WhatsApp,"Attributing false claims to respected organisationsAFP has debunked multiple claims shared millions of times on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease in December 2019. But with over 65 billion messages sent worldwide every day, WhatsApp, one of the biggest platforms for sharing misinformation in Africa, remains a challenge. AFP fact checkers explain how you can spot false COVID-19 claims on WhatsApp.While WhatsApp does not have specific user figures available for Africa, it is the continent’s most popular instant messaging app, according to We Are Social’s 2018 global digital report.Its end-to-end encryption represents a tough challenge for fact-checking reporters because it does not allow you to track the original source or date of a claim, or assess how widely it has been shared.In a recent example, AFP received a voice note and picture with claims that the clothes and blankets seen in the image belonged to COVID-19 patients in China and were being shipped off to Africa for sale. The speaker in the voice note asked people to “share this information to friends, families, and groups on WhatsApp… Do not buy these cheap things from the market in the coming days or months or years. Let them know cheap things will be sent to African markets for us to get this virus”.A quick reverse image search showed the picture had been circulating on the internet since April 2016 -- more than three years before the novel coronavirus outbreak.Another viral WhatsApp voice note in Nigeria claimed that World Health Organization (WHO) estimates showed some 45 million Nigerians could die from COVID-19. We found the claim to be misleading.International organisations like the WHO or scientific institutions  are often the target of misinformation because they are reputed key sources for expert information-sharing about the coronavirus.Days before South Africa announced its first case on March 5, a voice note circulated on WhatsApp claiming the virus had already arrived.The speaker attributed the information to Lancet Laboratories, a respected medical lab that refuted the claim immediately on Twitter.Another widely-shared message on WhatsApp alleged that all schools in South Africa would close on March 16, 2020. In reality, the government had announced all schools would be shut as of March 18.AFP Fact Check Africa debunked the claim by looking at the Department of Basic Education’s verified Twitter account, which also warned social media users to not “fall victim to fake news”.The situation is no different in East Africa: a message shared repeatedly on WhatsApp claims poisonous injections were sent to South Sudan to infect Africans with the novel coronavirus.South Sudanese health officials have rejected the allegations as false.Another WhatsApp message circulating among Sudanese and South Sudanese WhatsApp users warned people against using or distributing facial masks donated by China. The message claimed that China had supplied two million infected masks to Africa.The claim, rejected by officials, emerged shortly after South Sudan received protective gear and test kits donated by the Chinese billionaire Jack Ma.Meanwhile, before Kenya recorded its first positive case of COVID-19, an audio clip of a press conference purportedly held by a government health official was shared on WhatsApp alongside claims that the country had 63 confirmed cases already in isolation.The 5-minute clip, which was also shared on Facebook, listed four counties -- Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu and Mombasa -- as high-risk areas.Kenya’s health ministry dismissed the claims, saying the clip had been shared out of context and it was in fact part of a simulation exercise during a crisis communication training on coronavirus.The Ministry of Health would like to caution the general public against an audio being shared on WhatsApp groups about confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Country. There is NO confirmed case of COVID-19 in Kenya. @KNH_hospital @CDCKenya @UNICEFKenya @WHOKenya @BreakingNewsKE pic.twitter.com/dZ5lAPV2C0According to WhatsApp, “end-to-end encryption ensures only you and the person you're communicating with can read what's sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp”. This is to prevent personal information from “falling into the wrong hands”.But it also makes the transmission of false claims easier.Lagos-based software developer Jesupelumi Adetunji told AFP that allowing anyone -- including fact checkers -- to access data about a message “may tamper with WhatsApp encryption and that will affect privacy”.To stem the spread of misinformation, WhatsApp recently toughened its policies including banning spam accounts and setting a limit on forwarding messages that do “not originate from a close contact”.With groups containing up to 256 members, false or misleading claims still have the potential for wide reach. But WhatsApp’s parent company Facebook says the new limit has reduced the amount of forwarded messages by more than 25 percent.In a statement to AFP, the company said it provided “round-the-clock monitoring to prevent WhatsApp from being used to distribute mass or automated messages related to coronavirus. Compared to SMS, we are highly effective in this regard.”Unreliable Nigerian helplineAfrican governments are using the app in their battle against false news. South Africa has set up an automated WhatsApp support line to provide accurate information and advice about COVID-19. A similar initiative was launched in Nigeria but the WhatsApp line of the national Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) currently falls short of proving useful. It has a single automatic response for every question: “Ignore”.After 15 minutes of inactivity, the line sends users a message saying: “Thank you for using this service. Have a good day and stay safe”.Kate Wilkinson, deputy chief editor at Johannesburg-based fact-checking organisation Africa Check, told AFP the platform’s strict privacy means “users do not have concerns about other people viewing or criticising the information they share”.Wilkinson, who has been debunking misinformation at Africa Check for almost seven years, said people believe misinformation about COVID-19 on WhatsApp because they often receive these messages “from people they trust”. As a result, “their guard may be down and they may believe something that they wouldn't accept so easily on another platform”.“WhatsApp is primarily a platform that people use to communicate with people they know intimately. A user may receive misinformation from their parents, siblings, friends or nieghbourhood group. Challenging these messages is much harder when you have a personal relationship. You are not just questioning the information, you are also questioning the person's decision to pass it on.”You don’t need to be a digital verification specialist to spot false or misleading claims. Here are a few pointers:Beware of messages labelled ‘forwarded as received’: You may have seen messages marked “forwarded as received”. By adding these words, the sender implies that they are merely the messenger rather than author and cannot be held liable for the content. Many of these messages turn out to be false.Reverse image search: Many misleading claims on WhatsApp are shared with an image to make them more believable. You can run an image search here or here to find out how long the photograph has been on the internet, and what the actual context is.Beware of out-of-context videos: Take a screenshot of any clip containing information on COVID-19 and do a reverse image search. This may allow you to find the original video.Vet that voice note: Look for identifiable organisations mentioned in voice notes, and check if they have released official statements regarding the claim. Google the claims made to find more information.Pause before sharing: Before you share any piece of information on COVID-19, ask yourself the following questions:​​1. What is the original source of this information?2. What is the interest of the sender?3. Can it be confirmed by credible media?4. How long has this information been in circulation?5. Is there an update anywhere?If you would like us to check a claim, you can reach out to the AFP Whatsapp line here: +33 6 32 99 52 64",1
39,This footage of looting was filmed years before the pandemic,"Footage purportedly showing a looting spree in Mexico prompted by panic over the novel coronavirus was aired on multiple Facebook live streams and viewed by tens of thousands of people during the week of March 23, 2020. Posts sharing the streams claimed that the chaotic scene was happening in real-time. The claim is false; the streams showed old footage from a 2017 looting incident in Mexico that was being played on a loop.One of the Facebook streams, which has since been pulled down, was shared on this Kenyan Facebook group with more than 300,000 followers.Other Facebook streams using the same footage, archived here and here, were shared with claims that the looting was happening in the Mexican port city of Veracruz.The same footage was also shared on Facebook as regular clips here and here, and on YouTube here, with similar claims.In the comments, some viewers questioned whether the footage was actually live.AFP recorded one of the Facebook streams, which at one point had more than 150,000 viewers tuned in. It soon became apparent that the clip was playing on a loop, with the same scenes repeating every few minutes.For example, in the recording above, the scene where a man dressed in military uniform is seen walking at 0'05"" repeats at 6'10"".Another example: the scene at 0'32"" where a man clears items off a shelf and puts them in a white bin repeats at 6'42"".Footage from 2017By searching on YouTube for the keywords “looting”, “Mexico” and “Veracruz"", AFP came across a video with the exact same footage shown in the Facebook streams. But the clip had nothing to do with the pandemic: it was first published on YouTube three years ago.In 2017, Mexicans took to the streets to protest against a 20-percent hike in gasoline prices. The chaotic demonstrations led to a rampage in multiple stores, as reported here by AFP.The misleading stream came against a backdrop of stores being robbed and online calls for looting in Mexico as a result of the pandemic.",1
40,Public distrust hampers Africa fight against coronavirus misinformation,"African nations face a formidable foe in their fight against the novel coronavirus: misinformation fuelled by a deep distrust of government. AFP fact checkers report how this hampers the sharing of accurate information about the outbreak.False or misleading claims and indifference to official warnings are emerging as giant obstacles in a region where poor healthcare infrastructure provides fertile ground for COVID-19 to spread.Africa has recorded nearly 2,800 cases and 73 deaths, according to an AFP compilation as of March 26, 2020.The tally may lag far behind that of other continents but the World Health Organization (WHO), backed by the top names in medicine, has bluntly warned: ""Prepare for the worst"".“This is a new challenge that we are facing and it's a big challenge."" 
			Thumbi Ndung’u, infectious disease expertCountries have begun to implement strict rules including lockdowns, curfews and even prison terms for those sharing false claims.In Ethiopia, the national phone operator has replaced the dial tone of all phone calls with an information message on the virus, which sounds until the call is answered. “Your safety is key to us,” the 25-second recording begins in Amharic. It reminds Ethiopians to wash hands and stay “two steps away” from anyone who is coughing.But the measures appear futile in stopping the spread of misinformation.AFP has debunked dozens of claims in various languages, which have fanned out across the continent via social media platforms and messaging services.Viral messages on Facebook and WhatsApp carry unfounded advice that gargling with vinegar eliminates the virus or that black people are resistant to it because of their skin colour.""We must stop spreading fake news that either ridicule the efforts of the health workers or that frighten people.""
			Zweli Mkhize, South African health ministerWhile social media giants have toughened their policies targeting false or manipulated data, many claims in Africa circulate in private groups on the encrypted WhatsApp platform, making it harder to target them.“This is a new challenge that we are facing and it's a big challenge,” South African infectious disease expert Thumbi Ndung’u told AFP.“If governments are not forthcoming… or seem to be hiding information, then there are people who step into that space and some of those people may not necessarily have good intentions.”In South Africa, currently the region’s worst-hit country, misinformation started to circulate long before the first of its more than 700 cases was confirmed.Many of the widely shared claims on Facebook and WhatsApp have the potential of causing real-life harm, such as doctored government documents with misleading coronavirus advice.To counter the trend, officials are holding regular press conferences and have launched a coronavirus information website, toll-free number and WhatsApp support line.On March 19, the government went a step further when it announced that peddling fake coronavirus information would be punished with up to six months in jail.""We must stop spreading fake news that either ridicule the efforts of the health workers or that frighten people… We need those communities to be well-informed so that they do not panic in the wrong way and end up causing more problems for ourselves,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize warned earlier this month.But many South Africans remain wary of the official narratives amid perceptions of widespread corruption and incompetence.“Every epidemic also triggers an epidemic of false rumours.”
			Jean-Jacques Muyembe, virologistThere are also memories of the disastrous mishandling under ex-president Thabo Mbeki of the HIV crisis in the early 2000s. His policies caused 300,000 avoidable deaths, according to a Harvard study.However, the government has been “very forthcoming with information” in the current crisis, Ndung’u said.“I think they have learnt from the HIV epidemic and this can only be a good thing.”Kenya has already detained two people, including popular blogger Robert Alai, for sharing coronavirus misinformation under controversial cybercrime laws introduced in 2018.Alai was released on bail this week after being charged over a tweet saying the government was concealing the deaths of two coronavirus victims.There have been nearly 30 confirmed infections in the East African nation but no reported deaths so far.If convicted, Alai faces a fine of up to 5 million Kenyan shillings ($47,000) and up to 10 years in prison.Opponents, who have unsuccessfully tried to challenge the legislation in court, say it violates media freedom and allows authorities to clamp down on critics.But the government insists the measure is needed to fight the deluge of false claims circulating on social media.""Kenyans should desist from misinformation ... rumours must stop. Those who do not will be arrested,” the health minister warned in one of his daily coronavirus briefings.Distrust in the government's handling of the crisis has been fuelled by the fact that flights from China were still allowed to land in the initial stages of the epidemic despite growing concern.This sparked allegations that officials were trying to hide the first cases to avoid criticism for failing to ban flights early on.When the first infections were confirmed in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, conspiracy theories abounded that the government in the corruption-plagued country had made up the cases to cash in on international funds.“Nigerians at the grassroot, where majority live, think Coronavirus is a ruse or even a ploy by the government to 'steal' more money (sic),” Nigerian investigative journalist Damilola Banjo tweeted on March 11.Central to the claim, shared online by politicians and celebrities, was the government’s refusal to name an Italian businessman who was the first confirmed case in Nigeria.Hakeem Olayemi, a customer at a food stall in Lagos, told AFP he did not believe the official argument of “patient-doctor confidentiality”.“Why have they not named the Italian man?” he asked.With the number of confirmed cases nearing 50, opinion polls show the government is struggling to share accurate COVID-19 information despite launching an extensive online campaign.A recent Gallup-backed survey by NOIPolls suggested 26 percent of Nigerians believed they were immune to COVID-19.Fifteen percent also thought eating garlic and ginger would protect them against the virus -- a scientifically unproven claim circulating across Africa.""You will be surprised many aren't even aware (of the coronavirus).""
			Kunle Omotosho, Nigerian doctorCallers on Nigerian radio shows argued that instead of banning public gatherings, the government should shut the borders and the heat would then kill the virus.Observers say the government is also failing in efforts to reach rural communities.Kunle Omotosho, a doctor in southwest Nigeria, told AFP very little had been done in local languages to raise awareness among the general population.“You will be surprised many aren't even aware (of the coronavirus),” he said.Government distrust also runs deep in the sprawling Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).The conflict-riddled central African nation was already battling deadly Ebola and measles outbreaks when the coronavirus claimed its first two victims earlier this month.State efforts of disease control are viewed with suspicion fanned by false social media claims, and attacks on healthcare workers are frequent.Online posts show many in DRC believe the viral diseases either don’t exist or were created by the government to control the population.“Every epidemic also triggers an epidemic of false rumours,” virologist Jean-Jacques Muyembe told AFP.Muyembe, who led the fight in the ongoing but waning Ebola outbreak, has now been tasked by the government with tackling the coronavirus crisis.“Social media are a double-edged knife. It’s a very dangerous instrument and you need to know how to use it,” he said.",1
41,No such title has been bestowed on Kizza Besigye by Guinness World Records,"Posts alleging that Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye has been crowned ""the world's most arrested man"" have been widely shared and even received television coverage. But Guinness World Records confirms the claim is false and that the category is not open for applications.Besigye has dominated opposition politics for two decades with his Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) party and unsuccessfully challenged Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni four times.His many arrests over the years have repeatedly sparked online claims bestowing him with the dubious record title.NBS TV, a Ugandan television station, shared the latest claim on January 22, 2020 on its Facebook page, which has more than one million followers.“BREAKING: Dr Kizza Besigye has been recognized by the Guinness World Book of Records as the most arrested man in the world. The Guinness World Book of Records mentioned that Besigye was arrested 50 times as per Monday, 20th January 2020,” reads the post, which has since been deleted.A similar post was shared here on The Investigator, another Ugandan Facebook page with more than  100,000 followers.An article by Opera News, archived here, makes the same allegations and has had more than 2,000 online interactions, according to social media analytics tool CrowdTangle.It was shared on this Twitter account belonging to a Ugandan journalist, who has nearly 400,000 followers.The claim was also picked up by Citizen TV, a local television station in Kenya. The video, titled ""Kizza Besigye enters the Guinness Book of World Records as ‘the most arrested man'"", received more than 3,000 views on its YouTube channel before it was pulled down.Other posts sharing the claim can be found here, here, here and here.The tale of the dubious record is not new: in 2016, online news platform Ventures Africa published this article under the headline “Museveni’s long-time rival features in Guinness World Book of Records, all thanks to him”.The story is almost identical to the recent one published by Opera News.Is the claim valid?Guinness World Records spokeswoman Jessica Spillane told AFP the claim was “not true” and that Besigye had ""not been recognised for such a title”.""Although it [the category] is not actively open for applications and we do not encourage people to strive to break the record, the closest category we have is ‘Most arrests’, held by Tommy Johns of Brisbane, Australia, who by 1988 had been arrested almost 3,000 times for being drunk and disorderly in a public place,"" she said in an email.Ronald Muhinda, the spokesman of Besigye's FDC party, told AFP there were no official records of the number of times the veteran opposition politician had been in police custody.“I don’t think there are any official records of that [the number of times Besigye has been arrested]. I don’t think that even he himself can trace the number of times he has been arrested,” Muhinda told AFP on the phone.",1
42,This video shows protesters attacking a joint Turkish-Russian patrol in northern Syria,"A video viewed thousands of times has been shared in multiple Facebook posts alongside claims that the footage shows US troops being pelted with stones in Iraq. But this claim is false; the footage was actually filmed in northern Syria and shows protesters attacking a joint Turkish-Russian patrol.The video was notably shared on this Facebook page, which has more than 80,000 followers. It has been viewed over 13,000 times since it was posted on January 7, 2020.The caption reads: “Video of Iraq citizens stonning [sic] U.S Army caravan in Iraq.”The same video was posted alongside the same claim in several other Facebook posts, like here and here.The logo on the video belongs to the Russian international television network RT (formerly known as Russia Today).Using the digital verification tool InVID, we extracted keyframes and ran a reverse image search on the Yandex search engine. This led us to find the same video (in higher quality, and slightly longer) on RT Arabic’s official YouTube page. The title, in Arabic, reads “The residents of Al-Malikiyah throw stones at Turkish patrols,” and the caption mentions that this is a Turkish-Russian joint patrol. Al-Malikiyah is a city in northern Syria.Last November, during the same week RT published this video, AFP reported that a Turkish-Russian military patrol was pelted with stones by angry protesters in northern Syria.By typing different keywords into YouTube (like “Turkish,” “Russian,” “Syria” and “stones”), we found other videos from the same protest, including a CBS Evening News report titled “Kurds protest Turkish and Russian forces in Syria”. The report features CBS foreign correspondent Charlie d’Agata reporting on the ground in northern Syria.A closer look at CBS report shows that it matches the location of the RT video.First, there is a cemetery along the roadside in both videos. In the first clip, the graves are visible starting at 1'10'', while in the CBS report, they appear at 1'16''.In both videos, you can see an identical tree in the cemetery, as shown below.At one point, the two videos also share the exact same shot showing a man dressed in beige trousers and a white shirt throwing a projectile at the passing vehicles. The camera then pans out to reveal a boy dressed all in red and a girl in a white shirt and black pants, who are also throwing projectiles.In October 2019, Turkey and Russia agreed to patrol a strip of land in northern Syria in a bid to remove the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia to beyond 30 kilometres from the Turkish border. The deal brokered between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin can be found here.Why was this deal made?The Turkish government considers the YPG to be a terror group due to its links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) that has waged a bloody campaign against the Turkish state since 1984. Ankara and Moscow struck the deal after the United States’ abrupt withdrawal of 1,000 US troops from northern Syria in October 2019.",1
43,This false police alert about Islamic State jihadists ‘posing as medics’ has spread from country to country,"A hoax message claiming that jihadists from the Islamic State group are masquerading as medics offering people free blood tests -- while actually injecting them with the HIV virus -- has been circulating in various countries since 2017. The hoax, which has previously spread everywhere from India and Nepal to Ghana, has re-emerged recently in Kenya alongside a claim that three people were arrested over the plot in the city of Kisumu. However, Kenya police told AFP the security alert was “untrue”. Nepalese and Indian police have previously also warned people that the message was false.In Kenya, the claim has circulated via various posts since 2018.We’ve archived that post here. The same claim popped up in the Group Kenya Facebook group, which has over two million followers, in 2018.In Ghana, the message was shared last year on NDC TV, a Facebook page about the NDC political party, which has more than 200,000 followers.We searched for the first few words of the alert “Attention...If someone comes to your doorstep and says we from the medical college” on Facebook and spotted the same text in a post published by the verified account of Nepal Police on September 16, 2018.The Nepali-language part of the text says that Nepal Police did not issue the alert, warning that the message is misleading. “This is to inform you that the message was not issued by Nepal Police,” the last part reads.In Kenya, police spokesman Charles Wahong'o confirmed to AFP that the force was not dealing with any such situation, and there had been no such arrests in Kisumu.""This is not true, we have not had any incident of this nature reported,"" Wahong’o said.A search on Google for the first few words of the message located this fact-check on India Today published two years ago in which police in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh dismissed the same claim, which was circulating via Hindi-language WhatsApp messages at the time.The hoax has been similarly debunked before here and here.",1
44,Social media posts have located this flooded classroom in various African countries. It was actually filmed in Nigeria,"A video of students seated in a flooded classroom with a dilapidated roof, hardly protecting them from the heavy downpour, has been shared in numerous African countries in social media posts decrying the state of local educational facilities. Some web users claimed the school was in Kenya or Ghana; others in Cameroon, Togo or Tanzania. But a tip-off from comments on a Nigerian celebrity’s Instagram account allowed us to show that the video was actually filmed at a school in Delta State, southern Nigeria.Kenyan journalist Eric Njoka claimed in an October 29 tweet (archived here) that the school was in Kenya, though he later added a second post saying he was no longer certain this was the case.“Never mind, it's just another school in Kenya. Scroll up (even the government doesn't care, so why should you, right?) it's the new normal nowadays, right? ....This should NOT be happening,” said Njoka’s first post, which was retweeted more than 400 times.But other Twitter users claimed the video was filmed elsewhere -- in Tanzania, Ghana or other countries.Following these responses, Njoka tweeted: “I have received information from different quarters arguing that this is NOT Kenya, some say Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria etc, Fact is, there could be worst cases in Kenya and it does not matter where it is, Childrens' RIGHTS ought NOT to be violated. Period. I stand by my tweet.”The same clip was shared in this tweet, shared more than 20,000 times, claiming it was filmed in Togo. On Group Kenya, a Facebook group with more than two million members, an online user captioned the video: “Can someone explain where, why, when and how is this in Kenya?”A French-language Facebook post claiming the video was filmed in Cameroon was shared more than 24,000 times.Other posts archived here, here and here indicated that the video was recorded in Nigeria but did not give the name of the school.We ran a search for the footage on InVid, a video verification tool, but this did not lead us to the exact location of the school either. However, an Instagram post by Nigerian music star Daddy Showkey, who was crowdsourcing information about the location of the school, gave us a lead.“Please, can someone find out where this school is? I have seen worse in my neighbourhood but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t play a role in making a change,” he wrote.One of Showkey’s followers replied identifying the school as Urhiapele Mixed Secondary School in Sapele, Delta State, southern Nigeria.We searched on Facebook for the words “Urhiapele Mixed Secondary School in Sapele” and we found posts here and here indicating that Joyce Overah, a commissioner for Delta State, had visited the school after the video went viral online. Commissioners oversee the work of the different ministries within Nigeria’s 36 states.From the pictures included in the posts, you can see immediately that the green and white school uniforms match those seen in the viral video. Details pointed out in red below -- the distinctive lattice window and the missing ceiling panels -- also show that the classroom was the same one visited by Overah.We’ve reached out to authorities in Delta State for an update about what is happening at the school. We’ll update this post as soon as we have more information.",1
45,A tale of two zebras: South African photos used in misleading posts about Kenya’s polka-dot foal,"Numerous social media posts have shared two photos alongside claims that they show a rare polka-dot zebra foal, recently spotted in Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Reserve, being transported for sale abroad. The baby zebra, named Tira, had proved a hit online and claims that she had been sold met with dismay from Kenyan social media users. But an online tip-off and some expert help have allowed us to confirm that these pictures show a different zebra altogether. Kenyan wildlife authorities say rumours of a sale are “completely false”.Tira was spotted in the Maasai Mara in mid-September, to the delight of the national and international media. AFP recorded a video of the foal, which was named after the owner of the bushcamp where it was spotted.VIDEO: A polka-dot zebra foal is spotted in Kenya’s Maasai Mara National reserve.
		The unique dot pattern could increase the foal's vulnerability. Zebra stripes provide camouflage from colour-blind predators - the lines blur with movement and individuals don’t stand out in groups pic.twitter.com/QOy8YvnCmiLast week, rumours began spreading that the polka-dot zebra had been captured, placed in a truck and transported out of the Mara to be sold. One post on a private Kenyan Facebook group shared a screenshot of the claim to its more than 100,000 followers.This tweet -- using another name given to the animal by some social media users, “Debra” -- claimed the polka-dot foal was being moved to an unknown destination. The post was retweeted over 250 times and gained more than 650 likes.The same claims and images were posted here on Facebook and on Jamii Forum, a Tanzania-based message board. This tweet claimed the foal had been sold to “a certain Western Country”.The zebra in the pictures is from South Africa, not KenyaWe ran a Google reverse image search to try to find the original source of the two images circulating alongside the rumours, but this didn’t provide any leads.However, scrolling through comments under one of the posts, we spotted a link to a Facebook post by Craig View, a veterinary clinic in South Africa.The post included the images that have been circulating alongside the rumours about Tira, plus an extra one of a man posing with the animal. The post identified the man as Clifford Bull, the clinic owner. He’s recognisable in other social media posts and news articles about wildlife in South Africa.Dr Bull told us he had shared the pictures on September 30 after headlines appeared about the Kenyan foal, to show that Tira was not the only animal of its kind. The photos began circulating alongside the rumours a couple of days later, but he confirmed that the two are unconnected.“It is not the same zebra,” he told AFP in an email. “If one compares the markings on the two zebra it’s evident that the two animals are different.”Each zebra, he explained, “has different stripe patterns, much like human fingerprints. This serves two purposes: when the young are born they can imprint on their mothers, which allows them to recognize and stay with their mothers in the herd. It also serves as a mechanism that confuses predators.”The zebra pictured with him is a colt, a young male.Dr Bull added that both of these spotted zebras are vulnerable since their markings make them stand out, making them more easily seen by predators.This sadly makes it “a slim possibility that they will reach adulthood and have offspring of their own,” he said.How to tell the two zebras apartJustine Cordingley, a researcher at Grevy’s Zebra Trust, an independent wildlife conservation Trust in Kenya, helped us distinguish the two animals by examining their markings.Comparing the two, you can see that the foal in the Mara has a darker back and more spots on its belly and back leg than the one in the truck. Its neck is also spotty rather than stripey. The one in the truck also has very stripey legs.Dr Bull encountered the South African zebra colt at a small private game farm in the Mookgopong area of Limpopo province in July, and he estimates it to be between 10 and 12 months old.Tira is a lot younger. “The umbilical cord was still very fresh by the time I spotted it on Matira Bushcamp located in the Masaai Mara,” said tour guide Jonathan Tira, who first saw the foal on September 13. “From my analysis, it could have been born two days before I spotted it,” he told AFP by telephone.Where is Tira now?Ngugi Gecaga, communications officer at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), said there was no truth at all to rumours that Tira had been sold abroad.“There is no animal being sold, the claims are completely false,” Gecaga told AFP in a phone interview.He added that the KWS rejected calls to put the foal under special protection because its spots make it more vulnerable than other zebras.“KWS operates on the premise that animals should be in the wild. The zebra is not a special species, it is just a freak of nature -- similar to the albino zebra that we recently had. It won't be fair to isolate the animal and from a conservation point of view that would inhumane,” Gecaga said.“The zebras protect each other and it will be protected by its own. If a predator spots it and preys on it, it will be just the course of nature.”Tira’s current whereabouts are not known.However, French wildlife photographer Tony Crocetta wrote in a Facebook post on September 29 that he had seen the spotted zebra crossing the Sand River, which separates Kenya’s Maasai Mara National and Tanzania’s Serengeti Park.“The probability of coming across Tira again one day is sadly close to zero,” he wrote. “But I still believe in miracles.”",1
46,This video of a ‘politician’ being thrown in a river? It’s a dramatisation,"Facebook users around the world have been sharing a video that appears to show a politician being shoved into a river by outraged locals, for failing to keep a promise made during his election campaign to build a bridge. But while many web users were delighted to see what they thought was a politician getting his just deserts, the man is, in fact, an amateur actor. The video was made by a Brazilian community group which stages scenes that reflect local problems.The story appears to have resonated with voters who feel shortchanged by politicians, and the video has been viewed thousands of times via various posts including on Group Kenya, a Facebook group with more than two million members. We’ve archived the post here.“What we should (do) to all politicians,” the caption read. “He promised to build a bridge after five years he comes back asking for votes with the same bridge promise.”The same clip was posted on Instagram by Kenyan TV presenter Jane Ngoiri and on a Colombian Twitter account, as well as on a Malaysian Facebook page alongside a similar narrative.“This politician promised to build Bridge... Went Missing and came Back just before next elections to Promise them the Same Bridge. Can we do this in Malaysia,” said the caption.The video is stamped with a watermark that reads “Portal Engomadeira”. Hoping to find out more, we ran a Google search using the keywords “politician promised bridge Portal Engomadeira”. The search results located a longer version of the video on a Brazilian Facebook page named Portal Engomadeira.Engomadeira is a suburb of Salvador, the capital of the northeast Brazilian state of Bahia.The description on the longer clip, in Portuguese, included hashtags that can be translated as “#staging” and “#recording”, indicating that it likely showed a performance.The full caption can be translated as: “Politician made a promise he didn't keep and was thrown into an open-air sewer. #Recording #Staging #Lifereality #Georgetrovao #Ericosilva”.This longer clip also includes movie-style text which identifies the video as a “production of Erico Silva”.The full video makes it clear that the scene is stagedAFP Fact-Check’s Brazil team watched the video and explained to us that the man in the light-coloured shirt is seen introducing himself as a candidate for local elections and promising improvements to the area, including ending the open-air sewage system. Around four minutes in, text appears reading: “The councillor has been elected, and has not kept his promises. He returned four years later.”He is seen telling residents that he couldn’t help their community because there were too many things that needed doing elsewhere. Angry residents are seen booing him, and then he is pushed into the sewer he had promised to improve.Around the seven-minute mark, a man appears with a microphone to interview the “politician” -- and at this point, it is revealed that the supposed councillor is, in fact, the vice-president of the Portal Engomadeira community group.“We’ve made this video to show our people how much we have been deceived for four years. It's a long time to wait for everything to happen,” says the actor who plays the politician in the scene.In an apparent response to confusion over the video, which has been viewed more than two million times, the Portal Engomadeira clarified that the scene had been staged to make a point about local politics.“Was this truth, or role-play?” asked a Facebook user named Lew Ventura.The group replied: “Friend, the problems shown in the videos are real, but it was staged with filming and actors to show that when politicians come here making promises, they will get this response (if they do not meet them).”",1
47,Zambian farmer ‘greatly distressed’ by posts falsely identifying him as victim of South African violence,"During last week’s xenophobic violence in South Africa, a photograph of a bloodied man began circulating online alongside claims that it showed a Kenyan whose children had been murdered. We tracked down the man in the photo: he is Christopher Haambote, a Zambian farmer, and the photograph shows him after he was assaulted in 2017. He is upset to see the photograph circulating alongside false claims, telling us it was forcing him to “re-live the scenes of that day”.Last week, Kenya's High Commission to South Africa confirmed to local media that Kenyans were among the victims of arson, looting and physical aggression in the xenophobic attacks. As reported by AFP, the wave of xenophobic violence in South Africa has left 12 people dead and hundreds of foreigners displaced.The photograph of Haambote was shared to the Facebook page Group Kenya, in a post that identified him as a Kenyan victim of the South African violence.“Xenophobia in SA: Njoroge Gathiru from Murang'a brutalised, wife raped, children murdered, mall looted. Police in SA claims the attacks are justifiable. Kenya's foreign ministry has not issued a statement,” read the caption on the Facebook post, which was shared 100 times and attracted more than 400 comments and reactions. We’ve archived the post here.To track down where the photo came from, we carried out a reverse image search on Google which revealed that it first appeared online on July 14, 2019, in an article published by the Zambian Observer. So it was already clear that it was not taken during the recent xenophobic violence in South Africa, which began on September 1.The article on the Zambian Observer describes an assault on a man by a machete-wielding gang as he went to visit his wife’s grave. While the picture is not captioned, the article itself bears the byline “Christopher Haambote” and it was written in first person, indicating that the writer was describing his own experience.A search on Facebook to locate Mr Haambote led us to this Facebook account, and the profile picture appeared similar to the man seen in the Zambian Observer. We contacted the man on Facebook messenger, and he offered to speak to us via WhatsApp.‘Greatly distressed by the fake story’Haambote, a 59-year-old farmer, told AFP that a friend had alerted him to the fact that his photograph was circulating in misleading online posts.“Some journalist friend of mine informed me...The face is mine but I am a Zambian living in Lusaka bearing the name Christopher Haambote. I have been greatly distressed by the fake story,” Haambote told AFP via WhatsApp message.“I almost died on that day and I do not like the fact that people are using my face in such a way. It was a very traumatizing day and it is unfortunate that through the circulation of this picture I am forced to relive the events of the day,” he added.AFP also conducted an interview with Haambote via WhatsApp video, where he was wearing the shirt he was attacked in.Haambote directed us to a July 14, 2019 Facebook post he wrote about the assault two years previously, noting that the Zambian Observer had lifted his words from his personal account.He told us: “That Saturday I was visiting my wife’s tomb to place flowers, a tradition I had developed since her passing more than three years ago. On the same day, there was another burial of an outspoken youthful opposition leader belonging to the (UPND) opposition political party at the same graveyard.  A brawl erupted between UPND supporters and those of Zambia’s ruling political party (the Patriotic Front or PF).”Haambote said that though he is an ardent opposition supporter, he had not been attending the burial of the UPND leader when he was caught up in the trouble that flared afterwards.This 2017 report by the Lusaka Times notes that Zambian police recorded four assaults at the Leopard Memorial Park in Lusaka between UPND and PF supporters on June 24, 2017. Haambote is listed as being among the four who were beaten up.Though the assault was two years ago, Haambote told AFP that he took to Facebook to write about it this year in order to draw a parallel with an attack launched against Zambian justice minister Given Lubinda by PF supporters, as reported here.",1
48,"No, a Saudi man did not accidentally buy two Airbus jets","The story of Saudi man who accidentally bought two Airbus A350-1000s for his son’s birthday, instead of miniature models of the passenger jet, has been widely shared on WhatsApp and social media. The tall tale tapped into stereotypes about the vast wealth of some Saudi nationals, and prompted many social media users to jokingly wish that someone might accidentally buy them a similar birthday gift. Some social media users suggested the story was too good to be true, and they were right: it originated on a website that describes itself as satirical, and an Airbus official confirmed that it had been invented. He also talked us through the lengthy process of buying one of these enormous, expensive jets. Contrary to the story, it’s not possible to buy an A350 simply by handing over credit card details on the phone.A screenshot of an online article carrying the story has been circulating over the past few days in Kenya and India, among other places.A quick Google search allowed us to trace the screenshot to the website Thin Air Today -- we’ve archived the post here. According to data from social media analysis tool CrowdTangle, it has been shared more than 3,000 times on Facebook via various accounts, and received more than 2,000 likes on Instagram since it was published on August 15, 2019.However, the website says in a small disclaimer on the bottom of the web page that all of its content is satirical.The owner of the website confirmed this in a direct message on Twitter. “I have a satirical aviation-based website, just for fun,” he told AFP Fact-Check, declining to give his name. “And for the aviation community. The goal is not to spread fake news but have some fun and think.”Other sites have missed the satirical nature of the storyThe story may have been intended as light-hearted fiction, but other websites have since reproduced it without clarifying that it was made up for fun. The Middle East Monitor and Zambian entertainment site Tumfweko relayed the story, as did India’s Times Now before issuing a correction.On social media, some users doubted whether the story could be true, while others appeared intrigued by the expensive mistake. Many said they wished that their loved ones would make similar gaffes on their birthdays.It’s not that easy to buy an Airbus A350-1000According to Airbus’ guide prices for 2018 -- the latest available -- one A350-1000 costs a whopping $366.5 million, meaning the Saudi victim of the story would have accidentally paid around $733 million for the two planes, despite thinking that what he was getting were model aircrafts.“I got lost in currency conversions, I thought it was a bit expensive but still reasonable,” he is quoted as saying in the Thin Air Today post, which says he paid with American Express following a confusing conversation with Airbus staff due to his lack of English.In fact, buying a passenger jet from Airbus is not nearly as easy as the story might suggest.AFP contacted Airbus media relations manager Matthieu Duvelleroy, who explained that purchasing an A350-1000 is a long process with various different stages.“First, there needs to be an interest by an airline or a government upon which discussions on the needs will take place. After this, a call for tender will be made followed by price negotiations which could involve the board,” Duvelleroy told us by email.“Once the pricing has been agreed on, contracts will be drafted and signed then the first payment and validation of the scheduled of payment made. The parties will agree on the date of delivery in terms of the actual production plan,"" said Duvelleroy, adding that there were “many other processes” along the way.It is not, contrary to the story, possible to buy an Airbus jet using a personal credit card.“You can’t really buy A350 with your personal credit card,” Duvelleroy said. “This seems to be fake news.”",1
49,British couple’s photos used in false posts claiming the United States is legalising marriage between siblings,"Various social media posts and online articles claim to show an American brother and sister who have been permitted to marry by the US Supreme Court. This is false. The photographs used in the posts show Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld, a British couple who have campaigned for the right to obtain a civil partnership in the United Kingdom rather than a marriage. Keidan described the use of the couple’s photos in the false posts as “completely wrong”. The court ruling has also been invented; across the United States, siblings are not allowed to marry.The false claim has notably spread via various Facebook posts in Africa, including this post from Ghanian radio station Joy 99.7 FM which has been shared more than 1,000 times. We’ve archived the post here.""The overjoyed pair said they did it for the ‘millions of Americans who have consensual incestuous relationships and who are living in fear’ and blasted the Government for wasting taxpayers’ money fighting their challenge,"" reads the caption on the Facebook post.It included a link to an article on a website called “My Joy Online” about a brother and sister, James and Victoria Banes, who “have won the right to marry after a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States”. That article, archived here, has been shared more than 3,000 times on Facebook via various accounts, according to data from social media analysis tool CrowdTangle.A screenshot of an Instagram post carrying the same story has also been circulating on Facebook.While we’ve as yet been unable to confirm the original source of the false story, another version appears on a satirical website that uses the tagline ‘MOST SAVAGE NAME IN SATIRE NEWS’. This version has been shared more than 16,000 times, according to CrowdTangle data. The story also appeared on World News Daily Report, another “satirical” website which has been the source of various viral claims fact-checked by AFP.The pictures show a British couple who are not relatedA reverse image search led us to various news articles from 2018 reporting on the legal victory of Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld, a British couple who have been campaigning for the right to celebrate their relationship with a civil partnership rather than a marriage. You can see the photos on Britain’s Mail Online website, for example, and one of them here on the CNN site.Britain introduced civil partnerships for same-sex couples in 2004. Gay marriage was legalised in Britain a decade later, but civil partnerships remained available for same-sex couples.Keidan and Steinfeld argued that heterosexual couples should also be able to choose between a marriage and a civil partnership. They argued that marriage had “treated women as property for centuries” and that a civil partnership was, for them, preferable. As detailed on the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign website, Keidan and Steinfeld launched a legal case over the issue in late 2014 which eventually ended up in the UK Supreme Court in 2018.While the Supreme Court agreed with the couple that they should be able to choose between the two types of union just like gay couples, UK law currently remains unchanged. The Guardian newspaper reported in July that ministers are still considering how to expand civil partnerships following the court case.Keidan told AFP that he and his partner Steinfeld were still not married.“We are an unmarried and un-related different-sex couple in the UK seeking a civil partnership,” he said in an email. He went on to dismiss the fake posts about incest in the United States, saying: “This is all completely wrong and/or referring to another case while using photos of us.”Siblings cannot marry in the United StatesThe term “incest” generally refers to sexual relations between close family members, and American laws on this issue vary between jurisdictions within the country. Many states outlaw sexual relationships between siblings and between parents and their children, and no state allows siblings to marry. In some states, such as Oklahoma, such relations are punishable with prison sentences. In New Jersey and Rhode Island, it is not a criminal offence for two siblings to have a consensual sexual relationship, but they would still not be allowed to marry.As for the supposed Supreme Court ruling in favour of a brother and sister called James and Victoria Banes, it never took place. A search of the US Supreme Court website returned no results about a case involving a “James Banes” or “Victoria Banes”.",1
50,An old hoax about Christian missionaries being sentenced to death in Afghanistan is spreading online again,"A decade-old hoax urging people to pray for 22 Christian missionaries facing a death sentence in Afghanistan has re-emerged online, with numerous posts carrying the claim in Africa. One widely-shared recent post includes a photograph which probably shows an execution by Islamists in Iraq, not Afghanistan.""Breaking News: Please pray for the 22 Christian missionaries who have been sentenced to death tomorrow afternoon by the Islamist in Afghans. Can you please pass on this news as fast as possible so that a lot of people can pray for them,"" reads one post, which has been shared more than 1,000 times since it was shared in a religious Facebook group on August 4. We’ve archived the post here.This hoax has been in circulation since 2009 and, as reported by fact-checking site Snopes, it has also spread via emails and text messages. We’ve archived a couple more recent examples on Facebook here and here.As reported by AFP, 23 South Korean missionaries were kidnapped in Afghanistan by the Taliban in 2007. The captors killed two of the hostages, Presbyterian pastor Bae Hyung-Kyu and medical-services volunteer Shim Sung-Min, in the initial weeks of the standoff. The rest were released.What’s the situation in Afghanistan?Emal Haidary, one of AFP’s reporters in Kabul, confirmed that Christians are not allowed to spread their faith in Afghanistan.“Christian missionary work is illegal in Afghanistan, because the basis of all the laws here is the Islamic Sharia, and Sharia does not allow Christian missionary work or apostasy (renunciation of the Muslim faith),” Haidary explained.“But the fact is, there are some Christian missionaries secretly operating in some parts of the country, mostly under the name of charity organisations et cetera. There are also some Afghan missionaries in Kabul too. But they have to be extremely secretive, otherwise they will be in big trouble.”Haidary told us that “in Taliban-controlled areas, the punishment for apostasy is death. But in government-controlled areas, the courts may show some leniency.”The Taliban, a hardline Islamist movement, governed Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001, handing out extreme punishments including public executions and chopping off the hands of thieves.They were ousted from power by a US-led military operation in 2001 and were initially written off as a spent force, but they have re-emerged to lead an insurgency against the new Western-backed government. The rival Islamic State jihadist group has also emerged as a force in Afghanistan since 2015.There have been cases of the Taliban killing people accused of working as Christian missionaries, including the 2014 attack on a South African family living in Kabul. Friends said the family were strict Christians, but not missionaries. In 2010, the Taliban had claimed responsibility for killing eight medical aid workers, similarly claiming they were Christian missionaries.There are no recent reports of missionaries being sentenced to death or executed in AfghanistanThe situation in Afghanistan remains deeply insecure, and as Haidary said, missionary work is illegal.However, there are no recent reports of a mass death sentence being issued against missionaries in Afghanistan, or a mass execution of Christians.The picture was probably taken in Iraq, not AfghanistanAs for the photo used in one of the widely-shared posts carrying the claim -- showing a blindfolded man about to be executed -- Haidary said that the clothing of another man, seen in white in the background, did not look Afghan.“Arabs wear long white robes, Afghans don't. ISIS (Islamic State) fighters in Afghanistan are outfitted differently -- they mostly wear shalwar kamiz,” Haidary said, referring to traditional garments worn by men in some parts of South Asia.“It looks like an old picture from somewhere in the Middle East,"" he concluded.Haidary was right about that. A reverse image search allowed us to trace the photograph to news reports about the execution in May 2015 of three men in Iraq by the Islamic State group.Reverse image searches on Google and Yandex led to this Daily Mail article, which reported that the photograph shows the execution of a man accused of spying for the government in Nineveh province, a northwestern area held at the time by IS.The same photograph as published by the Iranian news outlet ABNA a day later.We showed the photo to AFP’s fact-checking team in the Middle East, who said that several elements of the image indicated that it showed an IS execution in Iraq:1. The text at the bottom of the photo locates it in Iraq. It says the photo was taken in “Nineveh State”. Nineveh is a province in northern Iraq.2. The photo bears the hallmarks of IS propaganda. The yellow logo, seen partially in the bottom right-hand corner of the photo, has appeared in other IS propaganda. “Nineveh State” is also a term used by the IS group -- the Iraqi government does not refer to it as a state. The subtitle also identifies the image as showing an IS execution, reading: “Execution of the sharia judgment -- the Islamic State”.The logo is circled in red below:3. IS held this part of Iraq in 2015. When the photo first appeared online four years ago, IS was in control of a vast swathe of Iraqi land, including Nineveh. Iraqi forces took back control of the entire province in August 2017, but they periodically launch operations in the country's west and northwest border areas -- including Nineveh -- targeting IS “sleeper cells”.4. The clothing matches that worn by other IS executioners. Other IS propaganda material has also featured executioners wearing a long, loose black shirt, black trousers and a head covering. They have also, like in the video screenshot seen above, used a sword for the execution.All of these signs indicate that the photo shows an IS execution in Iraq, and not the killing of a Christian missionary in Afghanistan.",1
51,Ballistics experts explain why this man was uninjured after shooting himself in ‘incredibly dangerous’ video,"Videos of a man shooting himself repeatedly in the mouth with different guns, while remaining unharmed, have been viewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook. The man, who is wearing what appears to be a South Sudanese military uniform, boasts that he is able to protect the country’s President Salva Kiir thanks to this mysterious power. What’s behind the trick? AFP filmed a demonstration with a forensic ballistics expert to show that the man was firing blanks rather than live ammunition. Another firearms expert called the man’s behaviour “incredibly dangerous”, warning that children could be seriously hurt trying to copy him.One Facebook post sharing the video, which we’ve archived here, has been viewed more than 190,000 times since it was published on July 23 and shared more than 3,000 times.The man appears to shoot himself in the mouth with three different guns, releasing smoke and a loud bang. He is then heard gloating about how he can protect South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir.“We can protect Kiir anywhere, man,” he says.Another Facebook post, sharing a shorter version of the video, says in the caption that it shows the soldier “show[ing] off his spiritual powers”. “Note how spits out cartridges as though they were peanuts,” says the caption on the video. “I strongly believe he is from the original bloodline of the ancient Egyptians.”A third version of the video was uploaded alongside the caption: ""It's only in South Sudan where a Soldier can use his mouth to stop a bullet from a close range. We are Brave"".How we know the man was not using live ammunitionWe paid a visit to the shooting range of the National Gun Owners Association of Kenya in Kirigiti, Kiambu County, for a demonstration from NGOA chairman Antony Wahome, a forensic ballistics expert.He explained to AFP how the man in uniform managed to release only smoke while firing the gun into his mouth.“What basically he did was to separate the cartridge to get an empty case then used the empty shell to pull the trigger. When you shoot the gun with this empty shell, you will only hear a sound and see some smoke but there is nothing,” Wahome explained.During the demonstration, we noted the difference in sound between a gun loaded with live bullets and one loaded with an empty cartridge shell. A loud bang is heard from a gun firing a live bullet, while that from an empty shell is quieter. Hear the difference yourself in this video:A round of ammunition has four components:1. The case or shell - the container that holds all the other ammunition components together.2. The primer - an explosive chemical compound that ignites the gunpowder when struck by a firing pin.3. Gunpowder - A chemical mixture that burns rapidly and converts to an expanding gas when ignited.4. Projectile - The object expelled from the barrel. A bullet is a projectile, often containing lead.The man in the video is firing a gun using only the first of the four elements, which is why he remains unhurt.What the man is doing is still dangerousArthur Alphin, a US ballistics expert and retired army officer, said that live ammunition produces a recoil effect -- a backwards motion -- when the trigger is pulled. This does not happen in the video, another sign that the man was firing blanks.“They are NOT using live ammunition. There is zero effective muzzle blast, there is zero recoil, and there is zero function of the firearms,” he told AFP via email.He expressed disgust at the video, saying it could cause harm to children seeing it on social media.“The guys in this video are incredibly dangerous. They should be removed from office, stripped of their rank. What if some child saw this and tried it with live ammunition?” he said.Blank ammunition can be deadlyWhile the man in the video appears unhurt, blank bullets can be dangerous.As reported by NewYork Times in 1984, the actor Jon-Erik Hexum of the US TV series ""Cover-Up"" died after inadvertently shooting himself in the head with a pistol that fired blanks.Who is the man in the video?We’re still trying to confirm exactly when and where the footage was filmed. The man is wearing what appears to be a uniform of the Sudan People´s Liberation Army (SPLA), the army of South Sudan. On his chest you can see the SPLA emblem -- featuring the black, red and green of the country’s flag -- and on his shoulder, the army’s green and yellow insignia. Here’s a screenshot alongside a picture of Kiir in army uniform, for comparison.An AFP reporter in South Sudan identified the uniform as that of the Tiger Battalion, the security force guarding the president.We’re still trying to identify the man -- if you know who he is, you can get in touch here.",1
52,False reports claim US missionary underwent FGM in Kenya,"Reports in Kenya this month stated that an American missionary had undergone Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), a practice that has been illegal in the country since 2011. The missionary, Teresa Estes, told AFP that the reports were untrue and damaged her credibility in her work to save girls from FGM. She said she was considering legal action against the TV station that first made the claim. Kenya's anti-FGM board also stated that FGM had not been part of the ceremony.A report by K24, a private TV station, archived here by AFP, stated that 60-year-old Teresa Estes had agreed to undergo FGM before a traditional wedding ceremony.Despite the practice being illegal, FGM is still carried out by rural communities in Kenya, such as the Pokot community in the Rift Valley area.Estes had previously lived among the Pokots for almost a decade and decided to hold a traditional wedding ceremony with her American husband in July 2019.But the erroneous report stated that she agreed to undergo FGM as part of the ceremony.“Cheigar agreed to undergo the cut and fully immerse herself in Pokot culture,” a journalist said, referring to Estes by her supposed nickname ""Cheigar"".The video on K24’s YouTube channel was viewed more than 4,000 times, before it was later deleted.The description read: “They say home is what you make it. Two foreign missionaries of American origin living in Baringo county today caused a stir after they tied the knot under the Pokot culture, including undergoing Female Genital Mutilation in order to fulfill the marriage customs. The colorful ceremony attracted a huge turnout of eager residents who were curious to witness the cultural spectacle.”The report also formed the topic of a discussion on another television show on Switch TV posted on Youtube and generated a number of articles that AFP has archived here, here, here and here.The same claims also spread on Facebook where they were shared as facts. Nairobinews, for instance, posted a link to an article on its Facebook page, which has more than 700,000 followers, archived here. It has since removed the story from its website.Other Facebook posts can be found here and here.Critical tweets shared articles with similar claims and tagged Kenyan authorities, while some online users called for the couple to be deported.Visibly shaken, Estes denied the claims that she herself had undergone FGM, which she said were humiliating and undermined her work.She said she came to Kenya in August 2010 as a missionary and had focused on preaching the gospel in the village of Chepungus, of some 500-600 residents. She said she helped girls to avoid undergoing FGM and forced marriages.“My credibility as a person who rescues girls from FGM is totally destroyed,” Estes said.Estes said she decided to hold a traditional wedding ceremony in the community after marrying Tony Estes a year and a half ago.“I have lived among these people for years and they consider me to be part of the family. So when my Pokot family heard I was getting married they wanted to have a Pokot wedding. I told my Pokot baba (father) that we will do the wedding but the dowry is just going to be symbolic. We will just have Tony buy a camel, bring gifts in some sodas and other things which we would use to cater for the feast afterward, not a real dowry,” she said.“We went through the traditional ceremony, they poured milk on us as a sign of blessing but I did not go through FGM,” she said.“FGM (female genital mutilation)  is a barbaric practice that leaves young girls literally scarred for life.  I help find sponsors to put the girls through school,"" reads a statement on her website.A day after the reports of Teresa’s circumcision were published, Kenya’s Anti-FGM board released a statement saying the news report was incorrect.“Investigations by relevant government agencies has (sic) established that there was a misrepresentation of facts in the purported case and FGM was not part of the ceremony as reported by a certain media house,” the statement read.Estes is considering legal action against the K24 television station, noting that she has received no formal apology for the erroneous report.“Whatever they did is defamatory. Deleting the video does not amount to an apology. If you slander you need to cover the apology the same way you covered the misleading one,” said her legal representative who was also present during the interview.Estes also denied claims in the report that she had permanently settled among the Pokots. She told AFP that she visited regularly but did not live with them in their village.She said a claim that her husband had lived among the Pokot for many years was also incorrect and he had first visited Kenya in July, shortly before the ceremony.Kenya has officially advanced in the fight against FGM in recent years. The 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) gives the national prevalence of FGM as 21 percent, down from 27 percent in 2008/9 and 32 percent in 2003.",1
53,A wildlife photographer’s frustration at the false story circulating alongside her award-winning picture,"A picture of a helpless antelope surrounded by three bloodthirsty and hungry cheetahs has been widely shared, in various languages, alongside claims that it shows a deer who sacrificed her life to save her fawns. The posts further claim that witnessing the scene pushed the photographer into depression. However, Alison Buttigieg, the photographer behind the lens, told AFP that there was no truth at all to this story. She expressed frustration that the false story is still circulating, even though she spoke out to set the record straight years ago.One of the posts, which we’ve archived here, has been shared more than 1,500 times since it was published on Facebook on July 5, 2018. Among the 1,800 comments, many readers appeared moved by the story of a mother’s unconditional love.“This photo won the award for best photo of the decade and led the photographer into depression. The cheetahs chased a mother deer and her two fawns (baby deer). The mother could have easily out run cheetahs but instead she offered herself to cheetahs so her young ones could manage to run to safety. In this picture she is seen looking at her babies running safely as she is about to be torn to pieces😢😢...There is no unconditional love like a mother's love,there's no tender care than a mother's care and there's no one in this world who sacrifices more than a mother do…” the caption reads.The same story has been shared in numerous posts in various languages, including Portuguese and Spanish. We’ve archived other posts in English sharing the false story here and here.A reverse image search using the online tool TinEye located the image on this blog owned by Alison Buttigieg, a Maltese wildlife photographer based in Finland.Buttigieg told AFP via email that the social media posts were inaccurate, adding that it was frustrating that despite clarifying what was happening in the picture years ago, the misleading version of the story seems to be what attracts online users.She took the picture in September 2013 at the Maasai Mara national reserve in Kenya.“This photo has now been viral for over 2.5 years -- always with the same fake story,” said Buttigieg, who had set the record straight in a February 2017 Facebook post.“Despite clarifying many times what is the true story, people prefer to spread the fake version -- as it’s sensational and gets a lot of ‘likes’. As a wildlife conservation photographer this is irritating because I strive to spread factually correct information about animal behaviour,” she said.Buttigieg expressed disgust at how mental illness was being used to spread a false narrative.“The depression part -- I have no words for that. To use a fake mental illness statement to make a story more viral is insensitive to me (it caused me problems in my workplace) as well as the people suffering from this disease.”She is also frustrated that social media posts are sharing her image without permission. The watermark that originally appeared in the top right-hand corner of the photograph, identifying it as her work, has been cropped out in the version that has been shared alongside the false stories.Because images are so easily shared on the internet, professional photographers like Buttigieg often mark their work with their name or website address. This means that their work can at least be recognised as theirs, even when the image is shared -- as is so often the case -- without their permission. In this case, however, Buttigieg is not even being credited as the person who took the picture.“It is disturbing that this day and age misinformation spreads faster than facts and people feel free to steal images, embellishing them with false stories and share them.  I have been harassed by some of these pages when I dared to report them to have the image taken down, “ she told AFP.Buttigieg gave us permission to use her image for this fact-check.The wildlife photographer directed AFP to her blog, where in a series of nine pictures, she explains how a mother cheetah was teaching her young ones to hunt down an impala.An impala is a type of antelope found in eastern and southern Africa. It’s not a deer, despite being described as such in the false social media posts.“I witnessed this Cheetah kill in September 2013 in the Maasai Mara, Kenya. Narasha, the cheetah mom, was teaching her youngsters how to kill prey.  However they were a bit slow on the uptake and they were playing with the hapless Impala prey instead of killing it. Narasha, the cheetah mom is the one that is grabbing the impala by the neck in all the photos,” the first paragraph of the blog reads.There is no mention of the impala sacrificing herself to save her babies -- this narrative was invented.While it’s also not true that the image won the prize for “best photo of the decade”, it did earn Buttigieg an award.As mentioned on her blog, she won a prize for the photograph at the Siena International Photo Awards in November 2016.",1
54,Protesters set fire to Burkina Faso’s parliament in 2014. Why is it trending in Kenya now?,"“Burkina Faso” was among the top ten trending topics in Kenya on Thursday morning, after an article headlined: 'Burkina Faso Parliament set ablaze' was retrieved from the archives and began circulating again online. Some 1,300 tweets were posted from Kenya about Burkina Faso on Thursday, some of them congratulating protesters in the west African country for setting the building on fire. Looking at the tweets as well as Facebook posts, it’s clear that some online users thought the fire had just happened. In fact, the parliament in Burkina Faso’s capital Ouagadougou was actually torched back in 2014. So why did it start trending again, on the other side of Africa, in July 2019?In October 2014, angry Burkinabe protesters surged toward the parliament in Ouagadougou and set it ablaze. As reported by AFP, they were protesting against a vote in the parliament on changing the country’s constitution to allow President Blaise Compaore to extend his 27-year-rule.On Twitter, this BBC article was widely shared by Kenyans on Thursday, in some cases alongside captions implying that the scenes from Burkina Faso were recent.Some users, however, noticed that the article was more than four years old. There was confusion over whether a fresh fire could have broken out.On Facebook, this post was shared in Kenya Political Forum, a public Facebook group with more than a million members. It claimed the people of Burkina Faso had burnt down the parliament building because MPs had become “greedy”.The post was shared over 200 times and attracted more than 2,000 comments and reactions.Why the fire started trending now: the row over Kenyan MPs’ salariesThe flurry of posts about Burkina Faso was apparently sparked on Twitter by Kenyan media personality Caroline Mutoko, who tweeted the BBC article alongside the caption: “Where people don't waste time on hashtags”. Her post was retweeted over 1500 times.Mutoko’s tweet came against the backdrop of anger over pay hikes that Kenyan members of parliament were reportedly seeking to bestow on themselves, further ballooning the country's already bloated public wage bill.According to data from the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC), the body responsible for reviewing the remuneration and benefits of all state officers, Kenya’s wage bill for the financial year 2017-2018 stood at about Sh 733 billion (US$7.1 billion).This translates to about 50 percent of the country’s total tax revenues for the period, according to the SRC — exceeding the limit stipulated in the Public Finance Management Act, which says that Kenya’s expenditure on public sector wages should not exceed 35 percent of tax revenues.This week, the Daily Nation newspaper published an exposé headlined: “Greed at its peak in MPs’ new demands to enrich themselves”, reigniting an angry debate over the salaries of parliamentarians.According to the Nation, Kenyan MPs were pushing to reinstate and increase several allowances that the salaries commission had scrapped.After the publication of the Nation’s piece, the hashtag #BureKabisa —Kiswahili for “Very Useless” — was used to criticise the lawmakers.On Thursday, however, the National Assembly speaker raised various complaints with the reporting of the story, including the claim that MPs earn more than a million shillings -- speaker J.B Muturi said the amount was 532,500 shillings, and that it was taxable. His statement can be found here.#DemistyfingtheFacts. The often misrepresented facts that Kenyans should know about the remuneration of Members of @NAssemblyKE and @Senate_KE pic.twitter.com/k222apaQxqSome Kenyan MPs have publicly defended the idea that they deserve a pay rise.Otiende Amollo of the ODM party, complained in this television interview that after various deductions from their salaries, Kenya MPs can walk home with just a few hundred shillings a month.",1
55,"No, being unable to find a sexual partner will not make you ‘disabled’ under new World Health Organization guidelines","Various articles -- most recently, in Kenya -- have claimed that the World Health Organization (WHO) is planning to redefine infertility to include people who are unable to find a partner. Reports that the WHO was widening its definition of infertility have been in circulation since 2016. But the UN agency refuted the reports when they first emerged in 2016, and WHO officials told AFP there are no plans to change the definition.One article published on the website of Kenyan newspaper The Star, which we’ve archived here, used the headline: “Inability to find a sexual partner is a disability - WHO”. The article, published on June 8, has been shared more than 700 times on Facebook.“In addition, failure to get pregnant after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sex will be considered a disability and not infertility as before,” the post reads.Another Kenyan website, Tuko, published similar claims, while the popular Kenyan radio station Hot 96 FM hosted a conversation around the topic last year and posted it on its Youtube channel, gaining more than 8,000 views.The recent Kenyan articles follow an earlier wave of reports in 2016 that the WHO was planning on updating its definition of infertility in order to grant everyone the “right to reproduce”. Many of the reports, including articles which we’ve archived here and here, cited a piece published on October 20, 2016 by Britain’s Telegraph newspaper.A video carrying the claims, which named US tech site Gizmodo as the source, was viewed over 100,000 times. Gizmodo had in turn cited the Telegraph.According to the Telegraph, which quoted “one of the authors of the new standards”, Dr David Adamson, the new definitions which were supposedly in the works at the time would have proclaimed equal rights for gay and single people to start a family.“Under the new terms, heterosexual single men and women, and gay men and  women who want to have children would be given the same priority as couples seeking IVF because of medical fertility problems,” the Telegraph reported.However, a day after the Telegraph article was published, the WHO published a statement which said that its definition of infertility remained the same and that there were no plans to change it.“WHO is not planning to make any changes to the definition on infertility,” the statement said.The WHO also tweeted the statement directly in response to a post that linked to the Telegraph article.Our definition of #infertility remains the same  the clarification from the WHO attracted little attention, and in the days that followed other outlets continued to report that the health agency was planning on changing its definition.We reached out to Dr David Adamson, the fertility expert cited by the Telegraph, about the comments attributed to him in the newspaper’s 2016 article.“Some of the statements in the article are the result of misunderstanding, misinterpretation, conflation of statements, statements taken out of context or without accompanying qualifications,” he told AFP in an email.“While I commented that the definition being considered created the potential for impacting individual, societal and legal aspects of reproductive rights, I was very clear in stating this was not the accepted WHO definition or policy in 2016. It is not now either. Unfortunately, this fact was not clearly stated in the article.”In a statement to AFP, the Daily Telegraph stressed that their article had never suggested that the new guidelines had already been “changed and adopted as WHO policy”.“The basis of our article was information given to our journalist, in company with two others, during two interviews conducted with Dr Adamson in person,” the statement said.“The WHO was contacted before publication for comment, but it offered none. We stand by our report of what Dr Adamson told us, the accuracy of which we note he does not dispute.”Neither Adamson nor the WHO had ever complained about the report directly to them, the newspaper added.Three years later, the WHO still hasn’t changed its definition of fertilityIt’s still not entirely clear where the mix-up came from, or why the WHO did not reach out directly to the Telegraph if there was a problem with the report.However, WHO communications officer Tarik Jašarević told AFP via email that the UN agency had no current plans to update its definition of infertility.“We are not updating any definition,”  Jašarević said, directing us to the statement issued back in October 2016.The WHO continues to define infertility as “a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse”.Does the WHO view infertility as a disability?Some of the articles published since 2016 have concluded that under the new guidelines the WHO was supposedly preparing to introduce, someone who was unable to find a partner would be considered to have a disability.This conclusion was based on the idea that the WHO has in the past considered infertility to be a form of disability.However, Rudi Eggers, the WHO's representative in Kenya, said this idea came from an old policy document which was released in 2011 and is no longer available online.“Although infertility is an impairment of biological function, WHO does not classify infertility as a disability, since disability is neither simply a biological nor a social phenomenon,” Dr Eggers told AFP in an email.He too confirmed that the WHO had no plans to change the definition of fertility.Reports claiming that the definition is about to change, or that people who can’t find a partner are about to be classified as having a disability, are incorrect.",1
56,Ignore these ‘polling figures’ on the popularity of Kenya's possible presidential contenders — they didn’t really come from IPSOS,"Posts claiming that the survey company IPSOS has released a poll on the popularity of presidential aspirants in Kenya ahead of the 2022 general election have been shared widely on social media. However, the claims are false -- IPSOS confirmed that the company has released no such poll, calling the figures “fake”.One of the misleading posts, which we’ve archived here, was published on the public Facebook group Kenya Political Forum which has more than a million members. The post attracted more than 100 comments and reactions.The bogus popularity ratings, captured in a graphical presentation that includes the IPSOS logo, implied that Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto was the most preferred candidate followed by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.The graphic also gives invented popularity ratings for three other prominent political figures: former vice presidents Musalia Mudavadi and Kalonzo Musyoka, and Gideon Moi, a senator who is the son of Kenya’s second president.Of the five of them, so far only Ruto has publicly indicated that he intends to run for president in 2022.The website Kenya Top Secrets published an article based on the supposed survey, while other posts carrying the fake IPSOS graphic can be found here and here.However, no such polling data is available on the IPSOS website, and the company confirmed in a tweet on July 3, 2019 that it had released no such survey.“Ipsos has not released  any poll on the popularity of presidential aspirants. The poll on social media is a FAKE poll,” the tweet from the French company’s Kenyan branch reads.Ipsos has not released any poll on popularity of presidential aspirants. The poll on social media is a FAKE poll.The Twitter account, @IpsosKE, is linked to from the company’s official website.Kenyatta was sworn in for his second and final term in November 2017 and politicians are already discussing who might succeed him when he steps down in 2022.However, Kenyatta has steered away from the topic of his succession in public and angrily called on colleagues to stop politicking and focus on development instead.",1
57,"No, this video does not show Tanzania's president furious with the national football team over their AFCON defeat to Senegal","A video circulating on social media claims to show Tanzanian President John Magufuli furiously lashing out at the national football team after they were beaten by Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) group stage game. However, the clip has been taken out of context and Magufuli was not talking about this match. It was filmed in March 2019 when Magufuli invited the team to the State House, and he was talking about a different game.This is the second time Tanzania has made an appearance at AFCON -- the last time was 30 years ago. This year’s tournament is not going so well for the East African country, and they are trailing with zero points in the group matches.On June 24, Tanzania was thrashed 2-0 by Senegal and three days later they were beaten by Kenya 3-2.Posts claiming that Magufuli was angrily addressing the national team over their poor performance at AFCON first circulated online after the Senegal game. This post for instance, on  KTN Kenya’s Facebook Page, shared an article from The Standard titled: ‘Kwani tumekosa wachezaji?’ (Is it that we don’t have players?) – Magufuli in furious tirade after Tanzania’s AFCON loss’.According to social media analysis tool CrowdTangle, the Standard article generated nearly 1,500 interactions and more than 180 shares.The website Nairobi News also carried the same incorrect story.In the 30-second clip that has been taken out of context, Magufuli is heard wondering how Tanzania could be defeated by a country with two million people. “Is it that we could not get 11 players from the 55 million people?” he asks in the Swahili-language clip.The Standard’s article embedded this tweet that included the clip, which has been viewed more than 5,000 times and retweeted more than 60 times.The tweet complained that Magafuli did not know the population of Senegal. But in fact, he wasn’t talking about Senegal at all.The clip was taken from live footage filmed during the national team’s visit to Tanzania’s State House on March 25, 2019 -- you can watch it on YouTube here.Magufuli had invited the national team to his residence after they qualified for AFCON, and gifted each player a parcel of land as a reward, as reported by AFP, as well as money for training.The clip used in the misleading posts was taken from a section of the speech when he was talking about Tanzania’s 1-0 loss to Lesotho during qualification in November 2018.We reviewed the long version of the footage. Magufuli says the following:“I had planned not to invite any team to the State House after you were thrashed in Lesotho yet I had given you my 50 million shillings. That game frustrated me. I want to talk about it because I watched the game and how you were playing. Some good players were not placed in their rightful positions. And I kept on asking myself, ‘Whoever was planning the match, did they do it intentionally so that the team doesn’t win, or what were they thinking?’”He then goes on to make the comment about being defeated by a country of two million, which is indeed the approximate population of Lesotho. This can be viewed here.From the full version of the clip it is clear Magufuli was referring to the earlier qualifier against Lesotho. The match against Senegal came months after the footage was filmed.",1
58,"No, these photos do not show Kenyan women protesting against a ‘lack of men to make them pregnant’","Images purporting to show Kenyan women storming the streets protesting against a lack of men to ‘make them pregnant’ have been shared hundreds of times on social media. In fact, the photos show protests over violence against women in both Kenya and South Africa.“Asking their Government to import 1000 Men from Nigeria to impregnate them. Wow,” reads one post sharing the photos, which we’ve archived here. The post, which has been shared more than 350 times, claims that the women were complaining that their husbands were spending too much time in the bar, leaving them unable to perform their conjugal duties.Another Facebook post archived here carried similar claims and was shared more than 200 times.Back in 2014, a Kenyan television station did report that women in Taita Taveta County, in the coastal area of the country, were complaining of ‘non-performing’ husbands due to alcoholism.However, the images used in these Facebook posts do not have any connection with this issue. All of them were taken at protests, in both Kenya and South Africa, after women were attacked for wearing short skirts.A reverse image search located the first picture here, taken by Reuters news agency on November 17, 2014. The caption says the women were protesting in Kenya's capital Nairobi after a woman was beaten and stripped. The assault on the woman -- who was attacked for wearing a miniskirt -- led to the #Mydressmychoice campaign which was reported by international media here, here and here.The other two images appearing in the series were clearly taken at the same event -- you can see several of the same women in both of them.A reverse image search conducted led us to this picture of a woman seen in both of the pictures, wearing a green top, blue skirt and headscarf. The photo appeared on a South African photographer’s Flickr account on February 29, 2008.A caption accompanying the images described the scene: “SOUTH AFRICA...LADIES dressed in mini-skirts marched to the Jack Mincer taxi rank in Noord street Johannesburg, to vent their anger at taxi drivers who sexually molested a girl wearing a mini-skirt.”Along with the woman in the green top and blue skirt, you can also see fellow protesters wearing the same red t-shirts in both this photo and the ones used in the Facebook posts.The t-shirts are inscribed with the letters APF -- which is the Anti-Privatisation Forum, an organisation established by activists in Johannesburg in July 2000.But for conclusive proof that these photos were taken in Johannesburg, we turned to Google Maps.This allowed us to pinpoint Plein Street, the site of the Noord taxi rank, where the Flickr caption said the protests took place.On Google Maps we were able to identify some distinct similarities proving that the protest did indeed take place in Johannesburg -- not in Kenya as the Facebook posts suggested.In both the photo of the woman in green and on Google Maps, you can see the same large skyscraper with a distinctive coloured stripe running across it, and the same green-fronted building to the left of it. You can also see the same distinctively shaped tree and the white canopy to the right.So, all three photos used in the Facebook post have been taken out of context to wrongly suggest they show women protesting against a “lack of men”.",1
59,"No, this photo does not show Algeria’s goalkeeper training for the AFCON game against Kenya","A Facebook post, claiming to show Algeria's goalkeeper performing an impressive feat of gymnastics ahead of last Sunday’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) game against Kenya, has been making the rounds online. In fact, it doesn’t show Algeria’s goalkeeper at all -- it’s a doctored version of a photo of Ivory Coast player Boubacar Barry, and it was taken during training for the World Cup in Brazil back in 2014.On Sunday, Algeria thrashed Kenya 2-0 in their Group C match, which was their opening into the AFCON tournament hosted in Egypt. The results were disheartening to football enthusiasts in Kenya.The post, which we’ve archived here, was published on June 23 on Group Kenya, a public Facebook group with more than two million followers. It racked up more than 3,000 reactions and comments.The post suggests that the Kenyan team could never have won faced with the Spiderman-like skills of Algeria’s goalkeeper Raïs M'Bolhi.“I was happy about harambee stars until I saw this Algerian goalkeeper doing his training. Harambee stars, it was a wonderful tour, journey mercies as you come back home. Karibuni tuendelee kusambaza noti mpya (welcome back home, we continue circulating the new currency notes),” the caption reads.President Uhuru Kenyatta announced this month that Kenya would be introducing new bank notes in a bid to fight corruption and money-laundering. Kenyans must return any 1,000-shilling notes by October 1.In fact, a reverse image search on TinEye revealed that the image used in the Facebook post was taken back in 2014 -- and it does not show the Algerian goalkeeper at all.The original photo was taken by AFP photographer Issouf Sanogo in Aguas de Lindoia, Brazil, during training for the FIFA World Cup. You can find it here on the AFP Forum website.“Ivory Coast's national football team goalkeeper Boubacar Barry stretches on the crossbar as he takes part in a team training session at Aguas de Lindoia on June 9, 2014, ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil,” the caption reads.As you can see from comparing the two photos, the one used in the Facebook post has been cropped and blurred. A ball has been added digitally to make the footballer’s antics look even more impressive.Sanogo confirmed that his photo had been manipulated. “Absolutely false -- there was no ball,” he said.This is Kenya's sixth appearance in the AFCON tournament, with the last one being in Tunisia in 2004.",1
60,This doctored video does not really show a ‘corrupt’ Korean politician being swallowed up by the ground,"Videos that supposedly show North Korean leader Kim Jong-un walking with a “corrupt” politician, who is then swallowed up by the ground, have been viewed thousands of times by African Facebook users after they were shared on two Nigerian pages. The videos in fact show a doctored version of footage from a historic meeting in April 2018 between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.One version of the video, which we’ve archived here, has been viewed more than 50,000 times and shared more than 2,000 times since it was posted by the Facebook page News Custodian Nigeria on June 6.The same video was posted by the Facebook page IPOB.com on June 9 and has since been viewed some 19,000 times and shared 700 times.“A Korean corrupt Politician gets his salary!” reads the caption on both videos.Many of the comments suggested the same punishment should be handed to corrupt politicians in the users’ own countries, be it Nigeria, Ghana or elsewhere.Some people clearly took the video as a joke, reacting with the “laughing” emoji. Others were more unsure, asking if the video was real or not.In the comments section, some users correctly identified the video as an edited version of footage from the historic moment on April 27, 2018 when Kim became the first North Korean leader to cross the border into the South since the Korean War ceasefire in 1953.You can see Kim and Moon’s encounter at the border as it actually happened in this video by Australian broadcaster ABC.You can read AFP’s report about the historic meeting here.The two Koreas went on to have two further summits in 2018, agreeing in September to pursue economic developments and avoid military conflicts of any kind along the border.But inter-Korean relations have been at a standstill since Kim met with US President Donald Trump in Hanoi in February, a summit that broke down without an agreement.Pyongyang has been disgruntled over what it sees as Seoul’s lack of action in pursuing inter-Korean economic projects. But at a time when the North is under multiple sanctions barring such developments, carrying out such projects is unlikely.",1
61,"No, this Kenyan grandmother was not arrested in 1969","A Facebook post which claims to show an elderly Kenyan woman who has been in prison since her arrest in 1969 has been shared thousands of times. But the grandmother seen in the photographs was in fact sentenced to three months in 2015 and only spent nine days behind bars.The post was published on Group Kenya, a public Facebook group with more than two million members, in December 2018 -- we’ve archived the post here. It attracted over 3,000 shares and more than 2,700 comments and reactions.The image, which shows an elderly woman wearing a yellow jumper over a prison uniform, was accompanied by a caption which identified her as Charity Wambui and pleaded with President Uhuru Kenyatta for her release.""Kindly Uhuru Kenyatta, Release this Lady, Charity Wambui she was arrested in 1969, mwachilie tu (just release her),"" the caption reads.But a reverse image search on Google shows that the photograph had appeared in a 2015 news report by Citizen TV which identified the woman as Margaret Ngima, not Charity Wambui.We searched this name on Google and located numerous other reports about her case. According to KTN News, Ngima -- a 100-year-old grandmother -- was sentenced to three months in jail if she could not pay bail of Ksh 100,000 ($1,000) for failing to obey a court order involving a family land dispute.The 100-year old was taken to Embu GK Prison in eastern Kenya. But her case prompted an uproar, and she was released after nine days following an intervention by a local politician who paid her bail.",1
62,"No, this is not an ancient Bible or Koran that was found at the bottom of the ocean","Social media posts shared thousands of times purport to show an ancient Bible -- or in some versions, a Koran -- that is still readable after it was found at the bottom of the ocean. The book is in fact not a religious book but a work by the US artist Catherine McEver. She explained on her blog in 2014 how she created this particular work by using a cleaning product to grow crystals on a dictionary.Posts claiming the book was a Bible or Koran found underwater hail the supposed discovery as miraculous.One Facebook post, which we’ve archived here, has been shared more than 4,000 times since it was published in November 2018.“This is a miracle,” the caption reads.Another post on Group Kenya, a public group that has more than two million members, similarly claimed the book was an “ancient bible” found at the bottom of the ocean. Like the first post, it encouraged people to share the image.Other online posts, like this 2017 tweet which has been shared more than 15,000 times, identified the book as a Koran.But a reverse image search on Google shows that the book is neither a Bible nor a Koran -- and nor was it found underwater.The search located the photo on Stuff You Can’t Have, a blog run by the US artist Catherine McEver.In a post on May 18, 2014 -- before any of the posts identifying the book as a Bible or Koran -- McEver described how she created the work by using the cleaning product Borax to grow crystals onto a book.According to a caption on the blog post, the book is actually a German-English dictionary.The post also includes photos of the book from other angles.McEver told AFP that she made the crystallised book in 2014 and that the artwork has no religious meaning.“The book is not a Bible. It is a used, leather-bound German-English dictionary that I bought at a thrift store. I think it is funny that someone is trying to pass on image of my book off as a Bible or some religious miracle,” she told AFP via email.",1
63,"This sick giraffe is in South Africa, not Kenya as claimed online","Posts shared on Facebook claiming to show a giraffe with the papilloma virus in Kenya’s Laikipia National Reserve have provoked some concerned people to contact Kenyan wildlife authorities. The pictured giraffe has the papilloma virus, according to park authorities, but the pictures were taken in South Africa’s Kruger National Park.A post published on this Facebook page with over 80,000 followers was shared over 50 times and attracted 90 comments and reactions.“DISTURBING...Papilloma virus attack spotted on a giraffe in Laikipia National Reserve, Kenya,” the caption reads.A similar post was published on this public Facebook group named Friends of Nairobi National Park which has over 20,000 members.The post received over 200 comments and reactions and prompted some Kenyans to call on the Kenya Wildlife Society (KWS) to locate the giraffe and treat it.As seen in the comments below some online users believed that the picture was actually taken in Kenya.Some comments indicated that the picture could have been taken by photographer Ed Raubenheimer in South Africa. Raubenheimer’s signature is visible at the bottom of the pictures, though it is not very clear.AFP contacted the South Africa-based photographer on Facebook and he confirmed that he took the pictures.“These photos were taken by me in the Kruger National Park last week near Satara... The Giraffe was eating normal had some Buffalo birds on it and seemed happy,” he said.A spokesman for the KWS confirmed that the pictured giraffe was in South Africa, not in Kenya.“Kenya Wildlife Service wishes to state that the photograph of a sickly giraffe doing rounds on social media does not originate from Kenya, as many have been led to believe. The person who forwarded the post omitted to indicate its rightful origin/location, which led to other social media users to think is in Kenya,” read a statement from the KWS sent to AFP by email.“From the appearance of the giraffe as seen in the picture our vets say that it indicative the giraffes could be infected by the papilloma virus,” added KWS spokesman Ngugi Gecaga.In South Africa, a spokesman for Kruger National Park told AFP that several giraffes had been spotted with the papilloma virus but that they were not being treated as the park let “nature take its course”.“There have been several sightings of such animals in the KNP. It is papilloma virus,” Isaac Phaahla told AFP in an email.",1
64,"This bridge is in Kenya, not South Africa, and it did not cost 11 million rands","The image of a bridge, supposedly built in South Africa for 11 million rand (around 750,000 dollars), has been shared thousands of times on social media, with users criticising the ruling African National Congress for the expenditure. The bridge is actually in Kenya and was still under construction when the photo was taken.One Facebook post, which we’ve archived here, has been shared more than 3,000 times and shows an image of what looks like a basic unpaved bridge. The misspelt meme says “This is an officiall bridge opening in Qwaqwa it cost 11 million…..can someone explain”.Qwaqwa is a former Bantustan or homeland in the eastern part of central South Africa and forms part of the Free State province.The Facebook user captions the post: “ANC delivers”, includes laughing emoticons and tells followers to make their vote count ahead of the South African elections -- which were two weeks away at the time of the post in April.But a reverse image search of the photo leads to an article published last year on the Kenyan news website Kenyans.co.ke which locates the footbridge in Machakos county, south of the country’s capital Nairobi.It names the source of the image as Twitter and says that the photo shows Machakos governor, Alfred Mutua, inspecting progress on the bridge while on the way to an event for solar-powered boreholes.Mutua told the publication that the bridge was a “simple box culvert” only halfway done, for a contract of less than one million rand.The story contains elements of a tweet by a parody account, AdvBarryRoux, criticizing the launch of an alleged $6 million bridge.That tweet reached the First Lady to the governor, Lilian Nganga, who replied in two tweets: One showing the bridge before and another saying work on the bridge was ongoing.Kenyan blogger Abraham Mutai also replied from his verified Twitter account that the governor was inspecting it rather than launching the box culvert (a tunnel structure that provides a passage over water or an obstruction). Mutai added that governors in Kenya attract crowds everywhere they go.A Google search “Qwaqwa 6 million bridge” reveals an article dated October 5, 2011, about repairs to three bridges in South Africa that had been damaged during floods in 2010, reportedly costing 11 million rand -- another element that appeared in the false posts.In Kenya, AFP spoke to Machakos county engineer Gregory Mutuku who was in charge of the construction of the box culvert.Mutuku told AFP that the project actually cost around $32,838. He said there were also plans to improve the road around the project, but that would be a separate contract.""We are planning to work on the approaches to the box culvert since it was not part of the contract. Also planned for implementation is improvement of the entire road into gravel standards,"" he said in a WhatsApp message.A seasonal river flows through the area and locals previously used a makeshift bridge to access churches, the market and a school.A local government official who escorted AFP to the location, Alex Muthiini Gideon, said that school children used to miss classes when it rained as flooding would make the area inaccessible.",1
65,A website is spreading a false claim that the US has added 10 countries to its visa waiver program,"An article circulating online claims that the US government has added 10 countries including Kenya, South Africa and Argentina to its Visa Waiver Program (VWP). But none of these countries appears on the VWP list available on the US Department of Homeland Security website. The US State Department told us there was no truth to the claim.The VWP allows most citizens of countries on the list to travel to the United States for business or tourism for stays of up to 90 days without needing a visa.The article, which we’ve archived here, claims that the US has added Argentina, Cameroon, Georgia, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Kenya, Malawi, the Seychelles, South Africa and Uruguay to the VWP list.It was published on a website calling itself “AP News” -- an apparent attempt to mimic the US news agency Associated Press. Some readers indeed took the article for a genuine AP article:The same text was shared on this Cameroonian news website, the Journal du Kwatt.But there is no trace of such an announcement on any official US government website, and none of the countries appear on the list of 38 nations currently included under the Visa Waiver Program.Some online users appeared unconvinced -- tagging the AP and the US embassy in Kenya, asking them to confirm if it was true or not.The US embassy in Kenya dismissed the claims as false in a tweet on May 17.This is a false story. For real information on the visa waiver program, go to  pic.twitter.com/9V4el3ZfU4We also checked with the State Department in Washington, DC who told us: ""This information contained in this article is incorrect. The US Department of State has made no recent announcement on the Visa Waiver Program.”Websites spreading false information sometimes attempt to imitate well-known news organisations to gain credibility. The US magazine The Atlantic, for example, recently described how a fake website, theatlatnic.com as opposed to theatlantic.com, was created as part of a pro-Iran misinformation campaign.In the case of the visa waiver story, the website’s address -- news-ap.com -- is different from that used on the official AP site, ap.org. The imitation site also doesn’t use official AP branding. And finally, the writing style doesn’t match that used by the news agency.For instance, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is casually referred to as ‘Mike’, contrary to the AP’s customary style of using people’s surnames when mentioning them for the second time in an article.",1
66,A fake BBC screenshot wrongly claims that Kenyans must leave the UAE,"A fake screenshot of a tweet by the BBC, supposedly reporting that Kenyans living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have been ordered to leave over a diplomatic row between the two countries over a controversial gold shipment, has been shared widely online. The BBC told AFP that they have issued no such report on their website or social media accounts -- the screenshot was doctored. Kenya’s foreign ministry also described the claim as “fake news”.The screenshot was shared on the Group Kenya Facebook group, which has more than 1.9 million followers -- we’ve archived the post here. “Sad! Sad! Sad! Just like that, we're coming back home,” the caption reads.The screenshot was also posted in the closed Kenyan Facebook group Uhuru Kenyatta Supporters, which has more than 900,000 followers.A close look at the screenshot provides telling signs that it doesn’t show a real tweet -- the font does not match the one usually seen in tweets, and the text in the link is too close to the left-hand side. The text is also slightly ungrammatical, which you would not expect in a post from a major news organisation.The post is nowhere to be seen on the @BBCBreaking Twitter account which supposedly published it, and the link given in the screenshot doesn’t work.A text search on Google for keywords in the screenshot -- “UAE Kenya fake gold” -- also yields no sign of such a BBC story.A BBC spokeswoman confirmed that the post was fake.“We are aware of a fake story with BBC News branding circulating on WhatsApp about Kenya and the UAE.  The story did not originate from the BBC and is not published on any of the BBC's digital or social platforms. We advise those who access BBC News via social media to check and verify any suspicious story that purports to come from the BBC on our website,” she said.Kenya’s ministry of foreign affairs also dismissed the claims in the screenshot as untrue.“Don’t give fake news mileage. The story holds no water,” Edith Fortunate from the ministry press office said via a WhatsApp message.There has been speculation in Kenya recently that diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates could take a downturn over a shipment of gold that was ordered by a Dubai-based company but confiscated at Nairobi’s airport in February.However, the UAE's Nairobi embassy tweeted on May 20 that relations between the two countries remained strong.The UAE Embassy in Nairobi is aware of disinformation circulating on social media recently, and can assure followers that UAE-Kenya relations remain strong and cordial. The Embassy urges all parties to refer to official channels for diplomatic updates. pic.twitter.com/S0oBuRN4y3Kenyan investigators suspect local fraudsters of scamming wealthy Middle Eastern buyers in a complex fraud scheme involving gold.",1
67,"No, this photo does not show an Indian Christian family forced to strip naked","Posts circulating online in Africa claim to show an Indian pastor and his family who were forced by villagers to strip naked as punishment “for preaching the Gospel”. However, a reverse image search shows that the photo shows a family who stripped naked in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in 2015 in protest against police officers' alleged inaction over a reported robbery.“BREAKING NEWS: Please pray for the Christian Pastor and his wife, being humiliated by Indians in Utter (sic) Pradesh -India, for preaching the Gospel,” reads one of the posts, which we’ve archived here. “They were made naked and March around town as punishment. Lord have Mercy.” The post was shared in a Kenyan Facebook group with more than 1.9 million followers.This version of the post, published by a Nigerian account in January 2019, was shared more than 6,500 times.The same photo and caption were also shared in this Facebook group attracting more than 150 shares.Running a reverse image search for the photo on Google led to a larger, uncropped version of the same picture. This version shows four adults without their clothes, not two.Searching for that larger image led us to news articles published in 2015 about a Dalit family in Uttar Pradesh, northern India. Dalits are people belonging to a lower caste in India’s traditional caste system.According to the articles, the family stripped naked in protest against police officers whom they accused of ignoring their robbery complaint.India Today used the photo in this story in October 2015, which reported that the family were arrested for obscenity when they stripped naked at a police station in Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. Similar reports about the family were published here and here.Contradictory reports said that the police were responsible for stripping the couple. But in this video, the victims confirmed that they stripped voluntarily as a sign of protest.Our India fact-checking team was able to provide a translation of the video.""We took off our clothes,” one of the victims is heard saying in Hindi. “The police are not filing our complaint, that is why we took a decision to remove our clothes. The police were paying no heed to our complaints against the robbers, so we resorted to taking this action.”A senior police officer interviewed in the video accused the family of gross behaviour leading to their arrest.“I have received a copy of the report and we have initiated a preliminary investigation,” the police officer says. “These people who took their clothes off were arrested for snatching a pistol from one of our officers. They have been booked for rioting, indecency in public and disrupting the work of the police.”It’s clear from these earlier reports, published years before the false posts started circulating in 2018, that this photo does not show a Christian pastor whose family were stripped to humiliate them.",1
68,"No, Trudeau hasn’t begged Kenya to send a million immigrants to Canada","Articles falsely claiming that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has begged President Uhuru Kenyatta to send one million Kenyan immigrants to the North American country have been circulating online. A near-identical report previously made the rounds in Nigeria. As with the Nigerian version, Canadian authorities have dismissed the reports about Kenya, calling them “fake news”. Canada is indeed seeking to take in a million more immigrants before 2021, but not from any one particular country.The claim was published on a website identified as CBTV, which we’ve archived here. It contained alleged quotes from Trudeau and a spokesperson for the Canadian Labour Department.CBTV used the exact same quotes in its false article about Canada seeking a million Nigerian immigrants -- simply changing the name of the country and “West Africa” to “East Africa”. Every other detail of the story is identical. We debunked the Nigerian story here.In Kenya, similar claims were shared here and here, based on the CBTV version. The three posts have generated more than 12,000 interactions on Facebook between them, according to data from social media analysis tool CrowdTangle.However, as with the Nigerian story, the Canadian High Commission in Kenya dismissed the claim as bogus in a May 2 tweet.𝗙𝗔𝗞𝗘 𝗡𝗘𝗪𝗦 𝗔𝗟𝗘𝗥𝗧!

69,"No, these pictures are not evidence of Angola banning Islam","Posts claiming that Angola has banned Islam have begun circulating once again and have been shared thousands of times on Facebook over the past few months. The posts are accompanied by images of ravaged mosques and protesting Muslims as evidence of the ban.But some of the images used in this post show devastated mosques in Syria, the Gaza Strip, and Bahrain, while the photos of protesters were taken in London when the reports of an Angolan ‘ban’ on Islam first surfaced in 2013. Angolan authorities have repeatedly insisted since then that they have not banned the religion.Muslims have indeed reported feeling unwelcome in parts of Angola, a traditionally devout Catholic nation.A local Muslim leader in Lunda Norte province told AFP that about 40 mosques had been closed in some parts of Angola, forcing those at the border to move to the Democratic Republic of Congo to mark the holy month of Ramadan.When reports on a ban on Islam first emerged in 2013 -- angering Muslims worldwide -- the government insisted there was no such policy, as reported by AFP.""There is no war in Angola against Islam or any other religion,"" Manuel Fernando, director of the National Institute for Religious Affairs, said at the time.Leaders of Angola’s Muslim community, who make up several hundred thousand out of a population of about 18 million people, have accused the government of religious intolerance and persecution.Two mosques were closed around the time of the reported ban in 2013, which the government said was due to a lack of necessary land titles, building licences or other official documents.As for the most recent posts reporting a ban, it is clear that the pictures accompanying them are misleading.One such post published in February 2019, which we’ve archived here, has been shared 26,000 times.“Angola become the first country in the world to ban Islam. According to the Angolan government, islam is barbaric and against the laws and well being of the Angolan people. Here we witness in pictures the destruction of mosques by the government,” the caption reads.A second post sharing the same photos, with the same caption, was shared here in April and has since racked up 5,400 shares.Other misleading posts have been shared here, here and here.Let’s look at the six images used in these posts.A reverse image search on Google shows that the first photo, showing a mosque with a green domed roof, is of a mosque in Bahrain bulldozed in 2011 during the Arab Spring.As the BBC later reported, the Amir Mohammed Mohammed Barbagi Mosque was more than 400 years old when Bahrain’s government ordered it to be bulldozed during the uprising, sending shockwaves through the island’s Shia community.The second photo shows a destroyed mosque with a turquoise-domed roof. An online search located the image on Wikicommons. According to the caption, it shows the wreckage of a refugee shelter, school, and mosque that were destroyed in the Rafah area of the Gaza Strip in 2009.Photos from other news outlets confirmed the caption. In this photo from Getty, you can see the same mosque from a different angle. The caption says it shows “the rubble of the al-Fadilah mosque after it was destroyed by an Israeli air strike in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2009.”The third photo was also taken in Gaza, but this time during fighting in August 2014.You can see the same mosque, in a photograph taken from a different angle, in this article on the website of the Jerusalem Post newspaper.As for the fourth photo, a reverse image search on Google traced it to a post by Amnesty International which indicated that the pictured mosque was destroyed by an airstrike in the Syrian city of Raqqa in November 2014.The London-based rights group was accusing Syrian government forces of unlawfully killing civilians in a series of aerial attacks on Raqqa at the time.Finally, there are two photographs of Muslims protesting against the Angolan government. A reverse image search on Tineye showed that these two images were originally published in 2013 by the British photographer Peter Marshall on his website, My London Diary.According to Marshall’s website, they were taken in November 2013, during a protest outside the Angolan embassy in London when reports of an Islam ban first emerged.This is not the first time since 2013 that claims of Angola banning Islam in the region have re-emerged. The BBC debunked the claim in 2016 after a flurry of similar reports popped up that year in the United States.",1
70,Image of emaciated Kenyan claimed to be man jailed by ousted Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir,"Reports on social media in various African countries in English, French and Arabic show an emaciated man who was allegedly found in an underground prison after being jailed by ousted Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir. However, the picture is actually of a Kenyan man and was taken by a BBC journalist covering a hunger crisis in northern Kenya in March.One of the false posts, shared on The People's News Africa  Facebook page placed the picture of the emaciated man alongside a picture of a man dressed in military regalia.According to the caption, the two pictures show the same person, Colonel Awad Ibn Awuf.“Breaking News: Colonel Awad Ibn Awuf, former Defence Minister of Sudan, jailed in 1995 by the ousted President Omar al-Bashir and declared dead in a plane crash in 2008 has been discovered alive in an underground prison in a Mosque. African needs self love more than anything!” the caption reads.The post has since been shared more than 1000 times and attracted over 700 comments and reactions.However, Sudanese General Awad Ibn Ouf was not declared dead in a plane crash in 2008 -- he is the man who announced the overthrow of Bashir in April 2019 following months of protests in Khartoum. He briefly became chief of the military council that took over, before stepping down.The man pictured in military uniform is actually Lieutenant General Omar Zain al-Abdin, the former head of the military council's political committee. AFP pictures of Zain al-Abdin can be found here.He and two other military heads also resigned, as reported by AFP here.Other posts, including this one shared on a private group, claimed the emaciated man was “Colonel Ibrahim Chamsadine who was Minister of State in Charge of the Defense in Bashir's government”.A number of articles, including here and here,  also published that version.Colonel Ibrahim Shamseddine died in April 2001 in a plane crash that killed several of Sudan’s military leaders, according to a news article published here.Another post, with over 400 shares, said the man was “Bashir’s political prisoner”.The visibly malnourished man is, in fact, a Kenyan man whose image was captured by BBC journalist Roncliffe Odit in March this year, during a drought in Turkana, northern Kenya.#WeCannotIgnore#BeyondPressConfrences #TurkanaDrought #KenyaDrought pic.twitter.com/uymClJvVbdOdit responded to one of the false posts stating: “I personally took this photo in Turkana Kenya”I personally took this photo in Turkana Kenya #FakeNews  National Intelligence and Security Service announced the release of all political prisoners across the country, the state news agency SUNA reported in April.Sudan has been rocked by months of nationwide protests that initially erupted after the price of bread tripled, before targeting Bashir's 30-year rule.Sudan's new military rulers and leaders of the protest movement have held several rounds of talks on the composition of a new ruling council, but they have failed to make headway.",1
71,"No, this photo doesn’t show a Ugandan pastor walking on worshippers","Various social media posts have claimed to show a Ugandan pastor walking on top of worshippers because he considers himself too holy to step on the ground. The image actually shows people celebrating the return of William Gabula Nadiope, a traditional ruler in Uganda, after his studies in London.One of the misleading Facebook posts -- we’ve archived it here -- has been shared around 700 times since it was published on April 25.“Pastor Busoga of Uganda says he is so holy that he can't walk on ground so as not to be contaminated. So his members submitted their bodies as a stepping stone,” read the caption.The same misleading post was shared in October 2017 in this Kenyan Facebook group which has more than 1.9 million members and in this private group, which has more than 600,000 members, last November.The same photo was also retweeted more than 300 times last year from this Twitter handle which has more than 95,000 followers.In 2017, this Youtuber cast doubts on claims that the man in the picture was a pastor and asked her followers to help her find out what really happened.Videos and images of pastors performing absurd acts on their congregants -- who are eagerly hoping to witness miracles -- are not unusual in Africa. Images of ‘men of God’ stepping on followers or riding on their backs have drawn controversy in the past.However, this particular image is misleading and does not show a pastor but the kyabazinga or traditional ruler of Busoga, one of the five constitutional monarchies of Uganda.A comment in one of the posts had identified the man seen in the photo as the kyabazinga, William Gabula Nadiope, returning home from abroad.Searching Google for the phrase “Kyabazinga of Busoga homecoming” led us to a video of the same scene, published on the YouTube channel of local television station NBS TV Uganda on December 2, 2015.As the caption explained, it shows local residents celebrating the return of the kyabazinga after a year of studies in London.Upon his return, hundreds of Busoga people gathered at Entebbe International airport to welcome him back home.Ugandan journalist Grace Matsiko told AFP that allowing the kyabazinga to step on them is a traditional act of deference among his subjects in Busoga.“Busoga subjects do it for the love of their king,” Matsiko said.The kyabazinga himself shared images of the celebration on Twitter here in 2015.",1
72,"No, these photos do not show Sudan’s ex-president Omar al-Bashir being arrested or getting a haircut in prison","Images circulating on Facebook pages across Africa purport to show Sudan’s ousted president Omar al-Bashir during his arrest and having his hair cut by fellow prisoners. In fact, the “arrest” picture has been altered to paste Bashir’s head onto the body of former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo. The haircut photo does show Bashir, but it is an old picture of him attending the Hajj in Mecca.This post from a Nigerian account, containing both of the misleading photos, has been shared more than 1,000 times (as with the other posts mentioned in this blog, we've archived the link to preserve its contents).Bashir’s three decades of iron-fisted rule came to an end in April when he was ousted by the army following months of protests against him. As reported by AFP here, the 75-year-old was transferred to prison after the army took over.The photo of Bashir getting a haircut was also shared in this Zambian Facebook post which similarly identified the other men as fellow prisoners.Another post carrying the image was posted on the Kenya Political Forum, a public Facebook group with more than one million members, alongside a similar caption.The image was also shared here, here and here, among other places.Despite the claims that it shows Bashir upon his arrival in prison, however, a reverse image search found that the image appeared in this article on a Sudanese news site, published on June 28, 2017.The article talks about a meeting between Bashir and his former aide Taha Othman al-Hussein in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, site of the annual hajj Islamic pilgrimage. According to the caption, the image is an archive photo taken previously, though it does not specify when it was taken.Bashir is known to have made the hajj pilgrimage several times in recent years.From this photo alone it seemed likely that the photo was taken during one of Bashir’s pilgrimages, and certainly that it cannot have been taken upon his recent arrival in prison, as it was already on the internet back in 2017.Further evidence that it was taken during one of his pilgrimages came from this article, showing a photograph of Bashir in a similar situation. This one, published in 2014, shows Bashir cutting the hair of one of his companions in Mecca for the pilgrimage.It’s unclear if the two pictures were taken on the same day, but if you look at the decor behind Bashir in both photos, it is evident that they were taken in the same building.The backdrop is recognisable as the Al-Marwa site inside the Great Mosque in Mecca. You can see the same distinctive balconies in images of Al-Marwa on Google Maps.The man standing behind Bashir in spectacles is his former aide Taha Othman al-Hussein. Othman was later sacked by Bashir and moved to Saudi Arabia; he is not in prison in Khartoum alongside the former leader. So it’s clearly an old photo.As for the photo supposedly showing Bashir being arrested while wearing just a white vest, it’s a crude manipulation.A reverse image search on Google and Yandex suggested the image was similar to photos taken of former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo during his arrest in 2011. This Youtube video, in fact, captures the arrest.You can see the same men in the background, including the man in a checked shirt and hat. From this comparison, it’s clear that Bashir’s face was digitally added onto an image of Gbagbo’s body.",1
73,This video does show flooding in Mozambique — but back in 2000,"A Facebook video which shows extensive flood damage in Mozambique is being interpreted by many users as showing the current situation after torrential rains following Cyclone Kenneth. In fact, the video was taken in Mozambique after floods back in 2000. The same video was also used in misleading posts in March about Cyclone Idai.Heavy rains have walloped northern Mozambique after Kenneth, the second cyclone to hit the southern African country in less than two months, arrived last week. AFP reported that at least 38 people have been killed by the secnd cyclone.The misleading post, which we’ve archived here, was published on this Facebook page with more than 130,000 followers.“HEAVY RAIN IN MOZAMBIQUE,” read the April 29 post.Some online users questioned the authenticity of the footage but fell short of correctly identifying it.A search on video verification platform INVID showed the video was made by British broadcaster ITN in February 2000, and published on the website of Getty Images.The caption read: “Aerial views of flooded town and stranded people on rooftops / South African military helicopters rescuing people / Flood victims wade through water to helicopter. Mozambique floods on February 27, 2000 in Mozambique”.Mozambique experienced devastating flooding in 2000, when Cyclone Leon-Eline struck, killing hundreds of people.",1
74,This video purporting to show a fatal ‘car race’ in Arusha contains old footage,"A video viewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook purports to show a car race in Arusha, Tanzania, that turned deadly on April 21, 2019. Media reports in neighbouring Kenya initially said at least eight people had been killed during a racing competition dubbed “Arusha Drive 3.0”. Police in both countries later gave lower, if conflicting death tolls, and Tanzanian police denied that the accident happened during a car race. We’re still trying to get to the bottom of what happened. What we do know for sure is that the video has been edited to include old clips that date back to 2015.Kenyan reports, including articles here, here and here which we’ve archived, said on April 21 that at least eight people had been killed in the accident, both Kenyans and Tanzanians. Disaster reportedly struck in Oldonyo Sambu on the outskirts of Arusha. According to early reports, the car race  involved motor enthusiasts from Kenya and Tanzania and turned deadly when two cars crashed into each other before ramming into spectators.However, Arusha police chief Jonathan Shana gave a press conference the following day in which he said that only two people had been killed -- and that there was no car race.“I want to issue a warning about social media,” Shana told reporters. “Some have given the figure of eight deaths and reported that this was a car race. None of that is true. There was no car race, and there were not eight but two deaths.”According to Shana, two cars crashed on the road when one of them sped up as the other was starting to turn.Kenyan police also spoke on Monday of a “fatal road accident” in Arusha, saying three Kenyans had been killed.The National Police Service wishes
		to confirm that four Kenyans were involved in the fatal road accident involving two motor vehicles, that occurred yesterday in Arusha. One Lady and two men passed on while the fourth person escaped with injuries. 1/2The video shared on the Facebook page of the Kenyan newspaper Daily Nation has been viewed more than 100,000 times. According to the caption, the clip shows what happened on Sunday before the crash.“Video surfaces of how the Arusha street car racing event went down before deadly crash that left 8 dead. Witnesses said the cars crashed into each other before ploughing into a crowd of spectators,” the caption reads.The first part of the video shows an excited group of men cheering on as the drivers of two cars, green and silver, charge their engines before speeding off to the sound of cheering from spectators.The same short clip was shared in this tweet and has since been viewed more than 8,000 times.We haven’t yet been able to verify the source of this footage or confirm whether or not it indeed shows the scene before the car accident.But comments on the video suggested that old clips had been used in the compilation.One of the comments on the Facebook post led us to this Youtube video titled ""Arusha Drags"" and published on August 18, 2015.

A look at where that number comes from,"When Kenya’s Interior Minister Fred Matiang’i announced tougher measures on the betting industry earlier this month, he cited -- as evidence that the country has a serious problem with gambling -- a claim that 76 percent of young Kenyans are involved in the practice, ‘leading on this continent’. In fact, the figure comes from a survey that only looked at six countries.Matiang’i cited the figure at a press conference on April 1, during which he announced that gambling companies will have their permits revoked if they do not provide proof by July 1 that they have paid their taxes.The minister signalled that he wanted the Kenyan betting sector to face stricter regulations, particularly since so many young people in the country gamble.“We have the unfortunate situation where we in Kenya are leading on this continent on the population of our young people involved in betting. 76 percent of our young people are involved in one form of betting or the other,” he said.He went on to ask: “What kind of country are we building? Are we raising our children and telling them, ‘Just do nothing with your life, just go around betting and become a millionaire and live well’? Is that the kind of thing that we’re telling our country and our children?”Matiang’i did not cite his source for the 76 percent claim, and many news reports simply quoted him giving the figure without asking where it came from.Some web users queried the source of the information.We decided to track down its source.The 76 percent figure appears to have come from a March 2017 survey by GeoPoll, a US-based research company.The survey looked at betting among young people in six African countries -- Ghana, South Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda as well as Kenya -- and indeed found that 76 percent of Kenyan respondents said they had gambled.The survey sampled 3,879 respondents aged between 17 and 35 across the six countries -- of which 1,130 were in Kenya, GeoPoll marketing director Roxana Elliott told AFP via email.Not quite. Matiang’i, speaking at the press conference, suggested that 76 percent of young Kenyans were currently involved in gambling.The study by GeoPoll clearly states that respondents were asked if they had gambled in the past. It would be more accurate to say that 76 percent of young Kenyans say they have gambled at some point, according to the survey.Having said that, of the Kenyans who said they had gambled at some point, more than half said they gambled once a week.As per this chart included in the study, that’s a higher rate than in any of the other countries where people were surveyed.The minister said that Kenya was “leading on this continent on the population of our young people involved in betting”. This is not necessarily true, as the survey only looked at six countries. It’s still possible that another African country may have higher gambling rates.But it is fair to say that young Kenyans reported higher gambling rates than in any of the other countries surveyed.Can we be sure that the survey data accurately reflects the reality of gambling habits among young Kenyans?No surveying method is perfect. GeoPoll collects information from people using a mobile phone app, and the company says on its website that it “recognizes that the mobile population does not always perfectly match the national population”.Kenya has some of the highest rates of mobile phone use in Africa -- in December, the Communications Authority of Kenya announced that the country now has more SIM cards than people. That suggests that surveying people via mobile phone is a fairly effective method of surveying people in Kenya.But even after you narrow down the pool of people answering questions to those who own mobile phones, there’s still the question of which people to pick within that pool.On its Frequently Asked Questions page, GeoPoll details how it tries to choose a group of respondents that is broadly representative of the wider population, by matching the demographics of the survey group to census data.  Kenya’s last census was in 2009 -- it is due to hold the next one in August 2019. So we should bear in mind that the data used as a basis for selecting participants in the 2017 survey would have already been rather out of date.Surveys are never going to perfectly reflect reality, so it’s better not to cite figures that have come from surveys as if they were facts. That said, the GeoPoll survey appears to be the most recent and most thorough survey available on the subject of youth gambling in sub-Saharan Africa.Online data reflects a widespread love of betting in Kenya. According to an annual report for 2019 by Hootsuite and We Are Social, 11 of the top 20 Google search queries in Kenya last year were directly related to betting.SportPesa, a Kenyan sports betting platform, currently ranks as the country’s 11th most popular website according to the website ranking site Alexa.Many commenters responding to social media posts about Matiang’i’s comments suggested that the reason so many young Kenyans gamble is that so many of them are unable to find jobs.Aloyce Omondi, an official at the Association of Gaming Operators Kenya, backs this theory.“I can tell you it is because of unemployment,” he said of the popularity of gambling among young Kenyans. “Initially gambling was a leisure activity for the rich, but currently young people are viewing it as a way to make money quickly and become millionaires,” he said.As Africa Check explained in October, talking about youth unemployment in Kenya is a tricky issue because, while few would deny that many young Kenyans are out of work, various youth unemployment rates are cited by different publications.The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimated that youth unemployment in Kenya stood at 26.2 percent in 2018 compared to an overall unemployment rate of 11.5 percent. A 2017 report by the British Council also estimated that 500,000 to 800,000 youths were annually entering a job market that is struggling to absorb them.It’s worth bearing in mind, however, that Kenya was not the only country surveyed which is struggling with high levels of youth unemployment -- South Africa’s youth unemployment rate was listed as an eyewatering 53.8 percent by the ILO.Omondi suggested that another reason for the high gambling rates in Kenya was that placing a bet is particularly easy in the country due to loose regulations up until now. Mobile gambling has taken off as an industry without changes in the regulation keeping pace, he told AFP.“There is a lacunae in the law in regards to mobile gambling. If you have a phone and internet you can easily go online and gamble with no regulations at all. But there is need to regulate the industry,” he told AFP by phone.Like others, Dr Ken Ouko, a sociologist at the University of Nairobi, drew a link between high youth gambling rates and “the alarmingly high levels of youth idleness arising from either joblessness or transitory limbo as they wait to join colleges and universities”.“In Kenya the advertising frenzy by betting firms has also contributed to the trapping of the youth’s collective imagination,” he told AFP.",1
76,"No, Kenya is not introducing the death penalty for wildlife poachers","Articles shared tens of thousands of times online have reported that Kenya is planning to introduce the death penalty for convicted wildlife poachers. The articles quote Tourism Minister Najib Balala, who is supposed to have made the announcement during a meeting held on May 10, 2018. However, Balala was not at that meeting, and told AFP there was no such plan. Capital punishment is in theory permitted in Kenya, but the country has an effective ban on carrying out death sentences. No death row prisoner has been executed since 1987.Kenya, like several other African countries, has seen its elephant and rhino populations decimated by illegal poaching to feed a booming international trade in tusks and horns. Elephant ivory is often carved into ornaments or jewellery and rhino horns are used in traditional Asian medicine, with China representing the biggest market for such goods.The articles about the supposed death penalty plan began appearing online in May 2018, shortly after the meeting during which Balala was reported to have made the announcement.Animal poaching is a highly emotive subject, and some articles reporting the announcement have racked up more than 100,000 shares each.One post published by South African site News360, which we’ve archived here, has been shared online 123,000 times, according to data from social media monitoring site CrowdTangle. Another, published on the website of Joseph Mercola -- a controversial alternative medicine practitioner in the United States -- has been shared more than 100,000 times. A quick Google search reveals that the death penalty claim has been repeated on a large number of websites.Existing penalties against convicted poachers have “not been deterrence enough to curb poaching,” the articles quote Balala as saying.In many of the articles, it’s unclear when or where Balala was supposed to have made his announcement, but the News360 article linked to a similar report from Britain’s Independent news website, dated May 13, 2018.That article, in turn, attributed the comments to China’s Xinhua news agency, which published a report from Kenya’s Laikipia County on May 11, 2018, carrying the remarks from Balala.According to Xinhua, Balala made the comments “during the official launch of the northern white rhino commemorative stamps at Ol Pejeta Conservancy located in Laikipia County on the slopes of Mount Kenya”.That event was organised by the Postal Corporation of Kenya. However, a post on the organisation’s Facebook Page revealed that Balala was not at the event and was represented by Patrick Omondi, a former director of research monitoring and strategic initiative at the ministry of tourism.Omondi, who is now the biodiversity director at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), told AFP that he had read out a statement on behalf of the minister at the event in Laikipia, and there had been no mention of the death penalty.“That is misinformation,” Omondi said. “I was the one reading the minister’s statement at the meeting and I can tell you nothing I spoke on behalf of the minister was related to the death penalty for poachers.”He added: ""I think in that meeting one of the local leaders casually said that poachers should be killed but nothing official came from the ministry.""We asked Omondi if he still had a copy of the speech, but he no longer had access to it.“It was a long time ago when I was in the minister’s office and since then I have been transferred to KWS. The secretaries at the office have also not been able to get the speech,”  he said.On February 7, 2020, the tourism and wildlife ministry sent AFP a copy of the speech, which contains no mention of the penalty. You can find a PDF version of the speech below.There is no record of any official statement from the Kenyan government announcing a move to introduce the death penalty for convicted poachers.The Independent, at the time of publication last year, said they had reached out to Kenyan authorities for confirmation of the policy change. The website updated its article on Friday noting AFP's fact-check and saying they had contacted Kenyan authorities again.Kenya has no plans to introduce the death penalty for poachersThe KWS biodiversity director added that there was no plan to introduce the death penalty in Kenya as a punishment for poachers.On March 31, 2018, during the funeral of the world’s last male northern white rhino, Balala had warned poachers they would face stiffer punishments -- but made no mention of the death penalty.“We are going to change our laws, Anybody who is caught with ivory or killing wildlife will be jailed for life. That is what we want to do,” he said. You can see him making the comments in this video:The tourism minister has been advocating for stiffer punishments for poachers and in a phone interview with AFP on April 11, 2019, he said the current penalties were not proportionate to the damage caused by poachers.""I have been pushing for harsher punishment because what we currently have does not add up at all. A kilo of ivory costs about $60,000 and the fine for a poacher who caught many kilos of ivory is only about $199,000. If you compare this, it seems to be a mere slap on the wrist,"" he said.""But this does not mean death penalty -- that, I assure you, was taken out of context. We can have the fines increased, longer jail terms and ensure that the poachers do not easily get away by paying fines.""Balala added that though poaching seems to be on the decline in Kenya,  campaigns to close down legal markets in Asia and elsewhere needed to be more vigorous.Poachers convicted of the most serious offences in Kenya can in fact already be handed a life sentence under the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act of 2013.The law sets out the punishments for various convictions, ranging from a minimum fine of one million shillings ($9,909) and/or five years in prison for those dealing in tusks, horns and other “trophies”, to up to 20 million shillings in fines and life behind bars for “endangered or threatened species”.Kenya’s penal code allows for capital punishment, but in December 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that the mandatory issuing of the death sentence for crimes such as murder, treason and armed robbery was unconstitutional.In practical terms, there is an effective ban on the death penalty in Kenya: no one has been executed since 1987, and in 2009 the then president Mwai Kibaki commuted the sentences of all those on death row to life imprisonment.",1
77,Old photos are being used to illustrate xenophobic attacks in South Africa,"Images purporting to show attacks against foreigners in South Africa are being shared widely on social media. A deadly new wave of violence against immigrants has indeed struck South Africa in recent days. But some of the images being shared in online posts about the attacks were actually taken years ago during previous anti-foreigner unrest -- or at protests that had nothing to do with immigration.Attacks against immigrants were reported in Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal last week when protests targeting foreign-owned shops spilled into violence. As reported by AFP, some 300 Malawians were displaced from their homes in the province’s largest city Durban and dozens of them have asked to be repatriated.The South African government has condemned the violence -- the latest round of increasingly frequent anti-foreigner attacks in a country where immigrants have borne the brunt of anger resulting from chronic unemployment.Online, many people in South Africa and beyond have expressed anger and dismay over the violence.But some of the photos circulating in posts about the recent violence date back as long ago as 2008 -- and in a few cases, they show protests that were not linked to xenophobic attacks.Let’s look at two such posts. Caution: you may find some of the images that follow disturbing.The first post was shared by a Zambian Facebook user in this Kenyan group, which has more than 1.9 million followers. The photos show a woman’s body lying on the ground, as well as a car in flames and fires in the street.“Xenophobia is real in South Africa and we all affected because lives are lost,” reads part of the caption.Trevor Ncube, a Zimbabwean media entrepreneur with 178,000 Twitter followers, also posted the same pictures here, where they were retweeted more than 200 times.The image showing a car in flames in the distance was actually taken in June 2016 -- a reverse image search showed that it appeared on South African news website News24. It was taken in Durban, the scene of some of the recent anti-immigrant violence -- but local reports at the time said that the protests were sparked by anger over people not being nominated as councillors by their political parties.So this photo was not taken recently, and while it was taken in Durban it does not show anti-foreigner violence there. News24 credited the image to Marshall Security, a crime prevention company in Durban.The two images showing fires in the street were also taken during the June 6 protests in Durban -- they appeared on the South African website IOL at the time.Then there’s the image of a burned-out car. That’s also from the protests in Durban on June 6, 2016 -- we were able to trace it to this Facebook post.As for the photograph of a woman’s body on the ground, we haven’t been able to trace its origins so far. Reverse image searches on Google and other search engines did not return any matches.One Twitter user suggested it showed a Ugandan woman, which we haven’t yet been able to confirm. If you know when and where this photograph was taken, you can get in touch with us here.Let’s look at the second Facebook post which used old photos to illustrate the recent xenophobic attacks in South Africa. “Happening in South Africa, foreigners are being killed, let’s pray for them,” reads the caption. Shared more than 200 times, it included images of graphic violence, one of which dates back to 2008.The first image shows a man on his hands and knees being burnt alive.It was indeed taken during a wave of xenophobic attacks in South Africa -- but in 2008.It was taken by a photographer working for AFP. You can see it here alongside its original caption: “A South African policeman attends on May 18, 2008 to a man that was set alight in Reiger Park during xenophobic clashes that shook the whole of Johannesburg.""The photograph caused shock around the world at the time, becoming a symbol of xenophobic violence in South Africa. The man seen in the photograph, 35-year-old Mozambican national Ernesto Alfabeto Nhamuave, was killed in the brutal attack.The post also included a photograph of a knife-wielding man about to stab another. Again, it wasn’t taken during the recent violence -- a reverse image search on Google found it located it on the website of Getty Images. The caption says the photograph, taken by James Oatway for the Sunday Times newspaper, was indeed taken during a wave of xenophobic attacks in South Africa, but in 2015.“National Mozambican, Emmanuel Sithole, is attacked by men in Alexandra Township on April 18, 2015 in Alexandra, South Africa. Sithole was stabbed in the heart and left to die in the street. He is the seventh person in the life of the xenophobic attacks which broke out in Isipingo,” reads the caption. Similarly to the photograph of  Ernesto Alfabeto Nhamuave, it became a symbol of violence against migrants in South Africa.Another image in the post shows a man with his back exposed, being beaten by a group of people carrying what appear to be stones.Again, it’s an old photo of xenophobic violence in South Africa -- a reverse image search traced it to the Reuters website, where it was posted in February 2017.“A vigilante mob attacks a Nigerian migrant outside a church in Pretoria, South Africa,” reads the caption.The same image was used by the BBC and Al Jazeera in 2017 coverage of migrants in South Africa.Then there’s the photo of a man wielding an axe.A reverse image search showed that it has been used in past years, including in 2016 reports of riots in Pretoria after a football match.Finally, the post shared this grim image of a person burnt to ashes.A Google search showed it had appeared online previously, with one result dating as far back as 2013 when it was used in this article about a robber being burned to death in Nigeria.",1
78,"No, these photos do not show the ANC launching new lighting in South Africa — and they don’t show a home built for a Kenyan widow, either","A post circulating on Facebook claims to show an African National Congress party counselor inaugurating new lights in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province. In Kenya, several articles claim the photos show a mud hut commissioned by a politician for a widow. In fact, neither is true -- the photos show Tanzania’s Energy Minister Medard Kalemani visiting a rural electricity project.“KZN Counselor launching safety lights Emahlabathini. ANC is very disrespectful,” reads a March 28 Facebook post, along with three images of a ribbon-cutting ceremony outside a hut.The photos have also been used in various articles (here's an archive link to one of them) falsely claiming that they show a mud hut commissioned by an unnamed Kenyan politician to rehouse a widow.Another post claimed the photos were taken in Nigeria.On Twitter, a post sharing the photos -- retweeted more than 1,000 times -- proposed that a competition should be held between politicians in Kenya and Nigeria for the ‘stupidity crown’.In fact, the photos show the Tanzanian Minister of Energy, Medard Kalemani, during a visit to the northwestern Kigoma region of the country. His ministry had tweeted two of the photos on March 26.The Swahili tweet from the official account, which is linked to from the ministry website, quotes Kalemani as saying that every Tanzanian citizen has the right to access electricity and urges contractors not to discriminate against residents based on where they live.""Wakandarasi wa umeme msibague makazi ya wananchi wakati wa uunganishaji umeme vijijini. Kila mwananchi ana haki ya kupata umeme"". Waziri wa Nishati, Dkt Medard Kalemani
		# ziarani Kigoma. pic.twitter.com/bFsDNjeeOtAll three photos were posted Jamiiforums.com, a Tanzanian message board site, on March 28, in a post that said they showed an electricity project.A statement posted on the Tanzanian energy ministry’s website said that Kalemani toured the Kasulu District, Kigoma Rural and Buhigwe district in northwestern Tanzania to inspect the third phase of a rural electricity distribution project. Kalemani also officially launched the connection of electricity in some villages during his tour.South Africa is set to hold a general election  in a little over a month on May 8, and the looming date has come with the spread of more politically-motivated misinformation.Report any #SAElections2019 digital disinformation at our new online platform,  This includes any false, inaccurate or misleading info designed to affect participation in & the outcome of the elections.

79,"No, this video does not show images of devastation from Cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe","A dramatic aerial video showing men, women and children stranded on buildings in flooded waters and scrambling  to escape by helicopter has been shared in online posts claiming to show the impact of Cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe. However, the video is old footage taken during devastating floods in Mozambique in 2000.Cyclone Idai has affected almost three million people in Southern Africa, of whom nearly 500,000 have been driven from their homes, the United Nations said on Tuesday.More than 700 people have been killed in Mozambique and Zimbabwe alone and hundreds are missing, as AFP reported this week.The misleading post, archived here by AFP Fact Check, was made on the Facebook page of Zimbabwe Today, an independent online newspaper. It was shared more than 4,000 times and captioned: “Please share so the world the can see the devastation and loss of lives by cyclone Idai. Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi need urgent help”.The same video was shared more than 200 times on this Facebook group with more than one million followers.A caption alongside the March 25, 2019 post read: “Situation in Zimbabwe now”.The first misleading post actually has a title at the start of the video stating ""ITN...Mozambique floods, 27.2.2000"" (see below).A search on video verification platform INVID showed the video was made by British broadcaster ITN on February 27, 2000, and published on the website of Getty Images.The caption read: “Aerial views of flooded town and stranded people on rooftops / South African military helicopters rescuing people / Flood victims wade through water to helicopter. Mozambique floods on February 27, 2000 in Mozambique”.Mozambique experienced devastating flooding in 2000, when Cyclone Leon-Eline struck, killing hundreds of people.",1
80,"Kenya: Be careful, old photos are being used to illustrate the drought in Turkana County","Images claiming to show the current drought in northern Kenya have been shared widely on social media. Turkana County and other parts of Kenya are indeed suffering a drought, and reports suggest that some residents are on the brink of starvation. But some of the images purporting to show the current situation are old pictures, taken both in Kenya and in other African countries.Last week this article in The Star newspaper, reporting that two people had starved to death in Turkana, sparked an online debate among Kenyans over the drought.Various images showing men, women and children in dreadful situations were shared alongside posts castigating the government for allowing its people to die from hunger.But at least five widely shared photos being used to illustrate the current drought are actually old images, in one case dating back as long ago as 1993.The first photo, showing an emaciated man outside his hut, was shared on this Facebook group with more than 950,000 followers. But a reverse image search revealed it was used in a video about Turkana, published on YouTube by the radio station Capital FM on September 2, 2011.The same image can also be seen in recent tweets that use the hashtag #TurkanaDrought or include the phrase “Turkana hunger”.In the Capital FM video, the man is identified as Kaler Uyereng, one of the millions of people affected by the 2011 drought which severely hit Kenya, forcing the then president Mwai Kibaki to declare a national emergency.The second image shows a boy surrounded by the carcasses of dead animals. Similarly, some posts have suggested that it shows the current situation in northern Kenya.However, a reverse image search showed that the picture had been posted on the website of the charity World Vision in 2017. It was accompanied by the caption: “9-year-old Ejiem sits with the carcass of his favorite sheep, Merireng, in Turkana, Kenya. The East Africa drought has caused the death of many animals like Merireng. (©2017 World Vision/photo by Jon Warren)”.Similarly, a photo of a woman and two children feeding on dry bones, which is being used in social media posts to illustrate the current drought, is also a photograph from the World Vision website. It does show a drought in Turkana county, but it was again taken in 2017.The fourth image shows a little boy lying on his stomach and drinking from a pool of muddy water.But a reverse image search on Google revealed the image was in fact taken in 2009 by a photographer for Reuters news agency in Ethiopia, during a severe drought which also hit Uganda, Somalia, and Kenya.A caption on it read: “A boy drinks water from a pond in Bule Duba village in the outskirts of Moyale, near the edge of Oroma and Somali regions of Ethiopia, June 12, 2009.”Finally, a fifth image shows a distraught mother carrying her starving child, whose ribs are protruding and can easily be counted. The image was shared on this Facebook group, which has more than 350,000 members.This image was in fact taken by an AFP photographer in 1993 in Kongor, in what is today South Sudan.BBC reporter Roncliffe Odit has been in Turkana this week and has been documenting the effects of the drought in photos posted on Twitter. Speaking to AFP by telephone, Odit confirmed that he met many people suffering from desperate hunger.“We landed in Turkana on Friday, March 15, 2019, to do a totally different story but changed our course when we saw the drought conversation trending on social media. Our editor asked us to go into the villages to find out if it was indeed true what was being reported online. We headed to a village outside Lodwar town where we were met by faces that speak of severe starvation,” Odit told us.“I met a blind woman in her 80s living alone as her two sons have moved away with the livestock to look for pasture. She had not eaten for three days, and her neighbours told me that they strived to bring her at least some porridge when they could.""On Sunday, I personally captured this photo of Mama Mariam Loolio, 85, and blind. She had done 3 days without food...

81,"No, this photo wasn’t taken at a protest against Kenya’s William Ruto this week","An image purporting to show a protester demonstrating in the Nairobi slum of Kibera this week against Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto has been circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp. But a reverse image search shows that it’s a doctored version of a photo that was taken during a protest after Kenya’s 2017 general election.The post (here's an archived version) was shared on this Facebook group with more than 900,000 followers on March 13, 2019, and is also being shared on WhatsApp.A caption accompanying the image begins: “MWIZI NI MWIZI...""A THIEF GOT NO ANY OTHER BETTER NAME, HE IS A THIEF!!!"" HAPPENING NOW...kibera residents are demonstrating against the DP H.E. William Ruto.”But a search using Yandex, a reverse image search engine, matches the photo to one taken in 2017 in Kibera by a photographer for Reuters news agency. You can see the photo available for download on this stock images website.“A supporter of opposition leader Raila Odinga in front of the barricade in Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, August 14, 2017,” reads the caption.So clearly the photo was not taken, as suggested by the Facebook post, at a protest in Kibera “happening now”.There were no media reports of a protest in Kibera on March 13, and a search of social networks produced no sign of a demonstration either.Looking at the original image side by side with the one being shared on Facebook, you can also see that the original version has been digitally altered to display a cartoon on the protester’s t-shirt.The caricature of Ruto is in the style of well-known Nairobi-based cartoonist Gado.Gado often draws Ruto wearing a turban, after photos of the deputy president donning the head-wrap for a Sikh wedding in 2016 caused a stir on social media.The words Mwizi ni Mwizi (“a thief is just a thief”) have also been added to the protester’s t-shirt.Ruto has been at the centre of corruption allegations and an online campaign dubbed #MwizniMwizi, targeting him and other government officials perceived to be corrupt, was trending on Twitter on Kenya on March 13 when the doctored protester image began circulating online.Ruto dismisses the allegations against him, but a 2018 Ipsos report ranked him in first position among political leaders perceived by Kenyans to be the most corrupt.In January, Kenya dropped a point in the annual corruption ranking produced by campaign group Transparency International, to score 27 points out of 100 -- where 0 is very corrupt and 100 is very clean.",1
82,This ‘video’ of the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash? It's a simulation,"A video claiming to show the view from the cockpit as Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 crashed on March 10 has been viewed 10,000 times on Facebook. The video is, in fact, an animation that was taken from a YouTube channel specialising in flight simulations.As reported by AFP, the Ethiopian Airlines jet, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa. All 157 people onboard were killed. Numerous countries and airlines have banned the 737 MAX 8 since the crash, which was the second fatal accident involving the model since October.Since Sunday’s tragedy, a series of photos and videos falsely purporting to show the Ethiopian Airlines crash have been spreading online. We’ve fact-checked some of these here.In this particular clip posted a day after the crash -- which we’ve archived here -- the caption says that the footage was obtained from “intelligence”.“Zambian Watch working with its intelligence have obtained a full video of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 which took off from Addis Ababa to Nairobi and crashed killing 157 people,” it reads.The same video was posted on Twitter in a post that claimed it was footage captured by one of the passengers.AFP traced the clip to a video simulation Youtube Channel called Bull Bosphorus, which has more than 30,000 subscribers. The account mostly posts animated simulations of flights, as well as live-action videos filmed through plane windows.The caption on this particular clip states clearly: “THIS IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, THIS IS ONLY A SIMULATED FLIGHT CRASH FOR ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT ET302.”It says that the video was made using X-Plane 11, a computer program which allows users to create realistic flight simulations. You can find other examples on the company’s website.Looking at the two videos posted on YouTube and Facebook, it’s easy to see that they show the same simulation. The Facebook version is of a lower quality, which makes it easier to mistake it for filmed video footage rather than an animation -- particularly when watching it on a small screen like a mobile phone.In the two screenshots below, you can see the same three signs on the plane’s dashboard in red, orange and yellow.And here, you can see the wing of the plane with the Ethiopian Airlines logo, at a similar angle with the same line of white clouds below.Finally, you can see the same distinctive cloud patterns in both the simulation on YouTube and the video circulating on Facebook.When false content like this is spreading around social media, it’s often useful to take a quick look through the comments to see what people are saying. In this case, several commenters on Facebook correctly identified the footage as having been taken from a simulation -- including this user who linked to the original YouTube video.​ ​",1
