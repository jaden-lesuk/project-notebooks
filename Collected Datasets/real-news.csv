1,Brown bottle: Why overcoming alcoholism is a struggle,"It's brown, it's colourless, it comes in different colours but the effects of the content in every bottle are quite different.These effects vary from person to person and this is all based on the reason why each individual decides to partake in the new sport called drinking.Ultimately if you were to undertake a survey on the individuals, you would find that a majority drink to get rid of an underlying problem or something that gives them stress. An external force that inflicts pain.There are some that seemingly take away the pain, some that numb the pain, and then there are those that make it feel like you have been placed in a sensory deprivation chamber; you know like the feeling of no gravity, no sense of smell, touch or sight?The hearing is there but to a minimal extent. Overall the lasting effect is what most people struggle to sacrifice for a more sober life.  As advertised, the sober life may not seem all that interesting due to the many challenges we all face on a daily basis, name it; toxic environments, overloaded work, financial issues left, right and center etc.The result of this is overbearing stresses and mental blocks that may lead to even more than just depression and other underlying stress related health issues.Because of this, people seek a way to 'relieve' the stress and one of the most common ways people choose to do this stress relief is dabbling in a little drink.Now don't get me wrong, alcohol is not all that destructive. In fact even in the Bible, Jesus advised that a little wine is necessary every once and a while.The problem comes in overdoing it even biologically the body does well with a little alcohol - wine to be precise - as it aids in the digestion process and many other blood thinning properties (for people with blood vessel clotting problems).But just like everything in life, there is a limit to everything we consume as humans. Ever heard of the phrase 'too much of anything can be poisonous'?I don't want to sit here and outline the result of over drinking because I'm sure a lot of us have had one or two or more odd defying instances where things would have gone horribly wrong due to over consumption of this ethanol based beverage, not to mention all the things that did go wrong. Nobody seeks to have a bad experience after a little pint, but because of the challenges we all go through, we feel like it is important to stretch the limits upon which our livers can synthesize the drink. But did you know that you can solve everyday issues, or even deeper problems without the need to get intoxicated or being in an altered state? I learned that seeing eye to eye can be fixed with a heart to heart, if all the relevant parties are willing to listenOf course in cases where the individual is drinking to seek fun or seek a sense of belonging by partaking because their friends are drinking, then for these two I would say FIND YOURSELF.Sheryl*, has struggled with the bottle for a very long time and she says she can't even begin to explain how it got so bad.""I honestly can't tell you when I started drinking heavy. Maybe I saw the signs before but preferred to ignore them or I was really into just drinking for fun. But I found myself in a bad place,"" Sheryl explained.She said it got so bad to a point she would drink a bottle a day.""It started with a few shots, a bottle of beer and before I knew it, I was drinking a bottle a day. It was really bad.""Sheryl says it all came to light one day and she decided to start a journey to recovery. ""One morning I decided to tell my family about what I was going through and I was very much surprised  with how they took the news. But the highlight of the day was when I had a sit down with my dad.""We had a deep conversation and he vowed to be by my side as I start my road to recovery and I must say he has never let me go even after going eight months without drinking,"" Sheryl said. One of the greatest joys in life is being able to accept yourself and accept your circumstances in life.It doesn't matter the hand you've been dealt, when life gives you lemons...you know the rest. Glass half full kind of mentality. This simple basis of thinking is what can help a lot of people put down the bottle.How you may ask? Well, if you're drinking from peer pressure, then maybe you need to check your peers. Make the necessary change.If you drink because you seek fun then my advice would be to look for fun in adrenaline fueled activities such as bungee jumping, mountain climbing, zip lining, paintballing, go karting, rock climbing, deep sea diving, wild life exploring and the list is endless. You'd be surprised what your body can do.There are soo many ways to find fun in this world without seeking it from the bottom of a bottle.For those that are trying to numb some sort of pain or get rid of certain stresses involved in their life, it is quite as simple as changing the environment you are surrounded by.It is considered very difficult to change your surroundings or uproot your life, but in some cases the hardest step to take are the most uplifting or stress relieving ones that we could ever meet in life.Stress is relieved for a longer period than with that of the two hours or so that alcohol affords, which is then exited into a toilet a few moments later. All this may be easier said or done, but at the end of the day, each individual must be the one to take the steps required to change life for the better.This simple statement is the main reason why struggles of letting go of the bottle exist.Everybody seeks an escape, a way to envision the life that fantasies are made of.In reality, if you can dream it, you can achieve it. One must be resilient and hopeful enough to see the journey to the end instead of seeking shortcuts and shrewd deals to try and improve their life.And then because the lack of the expectations being met, small onset depression creeps in, and that may be the deep seated reason why people seek comfort, friendship, a relationship, whatever it may be; through the bottom of the bottle."

3,Uhuru leads Kenyans in mourning former minister Nyachae's death,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has joined leaders in mourning former Cabinet minister Simeon Nyachae who died on Monday.In a statement released from the Sagana State Lodge on Monday, the President said Nyachae's successful transition from public service to the world of business and politics was a demonstration that focus and hard work pay.Uhuru said his death has robbed Kenya of a wise statesman whose long service to the nation helped shape the country's standing as one of Africa's most progressive economies.“I am deeply saddened by the passing away of Mzee Simeon Nyachae, a distinguished son of Kenya, a friend and a man whose contribution to the making of the Kenyan nation will remain with us for eternity,” Uhuru said.He added that ""Throughout his many years of service to the nation, right from his time in the provincial administration through to his transition into business and politics, Mzee Nyachae exhibited exemplary zeal to succeed and as he exits from this world, he leaves behind a rich legacy of success.”Uhuru recalled his interactions with Nyachae over the years, saying the former Nyaribari Chache MP was a jolly, accessible, and dependable elder whose wise counsel and friendship he will miss.""I recall with nostalgia my many interactions with Mzee Nyachae over the years.

4,Unrest in schools likely fuelled by drug abuse — Nacada,"The cases of unrest in schools might be a result of drug abuse among learners, the National Authority for Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse has said. The agency on Monday said their claim was not based on recent evidence but previous surveys in learning institutions unearthed rampant substance abuse. Nacada board chair Mabel Imbuga said a national survey carried out in June 2018 found that 20.2 per cent — one in five — of primary school pupils have ever used at least one drug or substance in their lifetime.The survey, ‘Status of Drugs and Substance Abuse among Primary School Pupils in Kenya’ also found that 16.9 per cent of learners were using at least one drug or substance of abuse.It further revealed that 3.2 per cent of primary school pupils were using tobacco, 2.6 per cent were on alcohol and 2.3 per cent chewing miraa or muguka.“This data points to the need for an urgent concerted effort aimed at preventing additional statistics among school-going children as one of the ways through which to curb this menace,” Imbuga said.The survey showed students found drugs in kiosks or shops near the school (28.6 per cent) and bars (25.7 per cent).More than 19.3 per cent got the drugs from friends, 13.7 per cent from other students while 13.6 per were supplied by school workers.Imbuga said tackling alcohol and drug abuse should involve both state and non-state actors. Ministries of Interior, Health and Education, Nacada, counties, parents and guardians must all come on board, she said. “Parents have a responsibility to nurture their children positively and those who choose to raise their children in a home where addiction is prevalent and even considered normal, can end up harming them in various ways,” she said.“Children look up to their parents for guidance in all ways and when a parent’s judgment is affected by substance abuse, they can not only cause a mental, physical, and emotional disturbance, but they can also severely alter or hamper their child’s development in all these stages.”Imbuga said Nacada offers school-based programmes which have resulted in a tremendous improvement in awareness levels on the dangers of drug abuse. The agency also runs family programmes focusing on positive parenting and strengthened communities.“In line with the Covid-19 prevention protocols established by Ministry of Health, we have embarked on media-driven campaigns to reach out to schools and engage them on prevention initiatives,” he said.Nacada called on schools’ boards of management to establish guidance and counselling departments or have chaplains to support learners and prevent their initiation into drug use.“In the meantime, we invite affected schools, churches and other institutions to liaise with us through our regional offices for support and inclusion into our school-based programmes,” she said. Imbuga said the agency is ready to work with and support any institutions requiring help in alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment.(edited by o. owino)"
5,[UPDATE] Mwilu gets reprieve as court halts order barring her from office,"Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has received temporary reprieve after a court issued stay orders against the enforcement of a ruling barring her from office until February 12.Mwilu's lawyers on Monday filed a suit seeking to set aside an order stopping her from discharging her duties.The application was certified as urgent by the deputy Registrar of the High Court in Meru.The stay orders will be enforce until February 12, which is the date set for the hearing of the application.Justice Mwilu had said the order stopping her from work amounts to judicial terror and one given without benefit of relevant and material facts before the court.“The drastic orders obtained ex parte are an egregious act of judicial terror and oppression obtained fraudulently and illegally through non disclosure of relevant and material facts and are inimical to the rule of law and fair and constitutional administration of justice,” said justice Mwilu.She questioned the motive behind filing the case against her before Meru court when all the parties involved reside in Nairobi.Judge Jeremy Otieno sitting in Meru on Friday made four decisions against justice Mwilu, effectively suspending her as Deputy Chief Justice, Judge of the Supreme Court, a member of the Judicial Service Commission and Ombudsman of the Judiciary.This also means that justice Mwilu will cease to act as CJ and chairperson of the JSC, twin powerful roles she took over following Maraga’s retirement a fortnight ago.The conservatory order issued in Meru was made following an application by Mbiti who cited four abuse of office charges pending against Mwilu at the JSC.In court, Mbiti argued that Mwilu’s continued performance of any constitutional duties while facing graft allegation reeks of favoritism and offends the tenure, ideals and spirit of Chapter Six of the Constitution.“She ought not to then enjoy preferential treatment because she is a Judge. The standard applicable to Mwilu in as far as Chapter Six of the Constitution is concerned is the standard applicable to all Kenyans. To this end, Chapter Six of the Constitution considers integrity beyond the extra-legal context into the realms of public perception, respect and honor,” he statedHe termed absurd, Mwilu’s continued stay as a member of the JSC, hearing and determining complaints against other Judges when she also has pending petitions against her.Mwilu has four pending petitions against her at the JSC, including one filed by the DPP and the DCI.In 2018, DPP Noordin Haji moved to court to charge Mwilu for abuse of office, obtaining security by false pretense, failure to pay tax and forgery.However,  a five-judge bench terminated her prosecution saying charging her with abuse of office and forgery counts violated judicial independence, and that evidence in another five counts had been illegally obtained.It was after the court battle that the case was referred to the JSC.And as Justice Mwilu kept away from office commissioner Mercy Deche who is representative of lawyers on Judicial Service Commission (JSC) is reported to have stepped in to take charge. Deche is the vice chair of the JSC.Deche’s term at the JSC is expiring in March and the lawyers will have to elect a new representative."

8,"'Fighter, powerful': This man Simeon Nyachae","Powerful, influencer and a fighter.These are some of the words used to describe former powerful Cabinet minister Simeon Nyachae even though most of his enemies described him as arrogant, dictatorial, overbearing and self-righteous.Nyachae, who was a shrewd businessman and entrepreneur, died on February 1 at the Nairobi Hospital after battling an illness for 10 years.Last month, there were rumours that the former minister had passed away which his son, Charles Nyachae, dismissed.But who exactly was this man?Born in Nyaribari, in Kisii County on February 6, 1932, the fiery speaker’s career began around 1960 when he was posted as a district officer in Kangundo division. POLITICSBy December 1963, Nyachae became a District commissioner before he went to provincial administration work in 1964.It is at this time that he rose steadily in ranks before becoming a chief secretary in Civil Service under the Kenyatta and Moi governments between 1965 to 1979.On his retirement from the civil service, Nyachae became one of the richest and most prominent personalities from Kisii.During his tenure, he came up with the now-famous District Focus for Rural Development programmes to curb rural-urban migration.Nyachae later vied and won a parliamentary seat in Nyaribari Chache constituency in 1992.With this, he was able to enter into the Moi government as a powerful Cabinet minister first for Agriculture, then in 1998 for Finance.RUSTY RELATIONSHIPHe was appointed to the Ministry of Finance in 1998 but quit the government a year later when he was transferred to what he felt was the less prominent ministry, he was to become the Industrial Development Minister.In 1998, Nyachae fell out with Moi after the former told Kenyans that their economy must be put into ‘intensive care’. He also waged a highly public battle against corruption, by reporting the names of prominent Kenyans who had not repaid bank loans.A few months later, in February, Nyachae was sacked. This made him leave his party Kenya African National Union also known as Kanu to join the Opposition Ford People.Nyachae, who was known for pomp and colour, later launched his presidential bid in Nairobi on the ticket of Ford People.His party was overshadowed by a bigger opposition rival, the National Rainbow Coalition, which picked Mwai Kibaki as its candidate.Since quitting the government, Nyachae had been quite open about his ambition as he felt under-appreciated.Reports indicated that his colleagues ignored his suggestion that the opposition presidential candidate should be elected by a popular vote involving delegates from all opposition parties.The Opposition later chose Kibaki and blocked Nyachae's presidential ambitions.Nyachae, who still ran for the 2002 presidency on a Ford-People ticket, emerged third after Narc's Kibaki and Kanu’s Uhuru Kenyatta.Later, Nyachae was appointed to head the Roads and Public Works docket under the Kibaki administration.After the 2007-08 post-election violence, Nyachae’s name appeared in the Waki report as one of the masterminds. Over 1,500 people were killed during the skirmishes that left thousands displaced.The 88-year-old Nyachae then retired from active politics in 2007 after he failed to clinch the Nyaribari Chache parliamentary seat.FAMILYThis iron fist man was the son of colonial chief Musa Nyandusi.  Having a very close relationship with his father, Nyachae, who was forbidden from playing football when he was young, was forced into marrying a 16 year old when he was only 22.The Standard reports that his father further directed him to marry again after the first wife did not get a son.After three years, Nyachae had married three women. He had more than 20 children.In April 2018, Nyachae tripped and fell at his home in Loresho . While at the facility, he complained of severe chest pains and was immediately taken to the ICU for closer monitoring."

City Captains will also be responsible for recruiting & training young people in their towns - so that they can earn income via our JForce Program,” Jumia Kenya CEO Sam Chappatte said. “We continue to see unserved customers in towns outside of Nairobi.

Jumia is a big company and with that comes bigger expectations as more Jumia customers will now collect their orders from my shop at a cheaper delivery fee,"" George Ngugi, Manager of Neema Salon in Kabati, Muranga county said.He believes that this will further expand his knowledge about online sales and boost his revenue, and later he may employ 1-2 people to help him run the business.  Jumia’s strategy is to expand its countrywide pick-up station network over the course of the year, with over 100 more pick-up stations expected to go live every month."
10,"Stop insulting Uhuru, let’s have decorum, Kabogo tells politicians","Ex-Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has told off politicians to stop hurling insults at each other and instead exercise sanity and decorum in their political engagements.In an apparent reference to recent attacks on President Uhuru Kenyatta by MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto, Kabogo urged politicians to be tolerant and civil.When need be, he said, they should differ decently and with decorum instead of hurling abuses at each other.“I don’t agree with everything else that President Kenyatta does. But I will not hurl insults at him,” he former county boss said.In a recorded video on social his Twitter handle, he added, “I will not tell him in a manner that is disrespectful.”Kabogo added that he may not also agree with everything that Deputy President William Ruto and ODM boss Raila Odinga do or say, he will never them in a manner that is disrespectful.“I will not agree with everything else that William Ruto says. I may not agree with everything that Raila Odinga,” he said.“We should have decorum. We should know that this country belongs to all of us, 47 million and not any one person or any one community,” added.President Uhuru has lately been the recipient of harsh and fierce attacks and criticism from a section of MPs allied to DP Ruto.Last week, a group of 41 MPs from Mt Kenya, Nairobi and Rift Valley allied to the DP Ruto a stern letter to the president ahead of the visit to his backyard last Friday.In the letter, the MPs decry the state of the economy, alleged betrayal of the DP, political 'persecution' and Uhuru's handshake with ODM leader Raila Odinga.The 11-page letter also seeks to address what the MPs say is the shelving of the Big Four Agenda for BBI and also tells off the President over his recent utterances.“The mountain will remain restless, dissatisfied and defiant. Ultimately, full-blown revolt will be inevitable,” the letter coming hours before the President tours the region concludes.Early last month, Kandara MP Alice Wahome hit out at the President, saying he should accept his time is up and stop ""hiding behind BBI to cling to power"" beyond his term.“For Kenya, to remain a truly democratic and rule of law state, our President must accept the reality his term is coming to an end. He must ensure a peaceful transfer of power in 2022 and go home,” Wahome said.Last year, MPs MP Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and Johanna Ngeno (Emurua Dikir) were arrested for allegedly insulting the President and his family."
11,ICC officially releases lawyer Paul Gicheru from custody,"The International Criminal Court has today officially released lawyer Paul Gicheru from its custody.This means that the pre-trial chamber’s decision was implemented as soon as the ICC Registry finalised all the necessary arrangements. In a statement on Monday, ICC said Gicheru was released to Kenya with specific conditions restricting liberty, during the confirmation of charges proceedings against him at the court.This follows Pre-Trial Chamber A's decision on January 29, 2021, granting him interim release with conditions.He is suspected of offences against the administration of justice consisting in corruptly influencing witnesses of the Court.The confirmation of charges procedure, in this case, will, in principle, be conducted in writing to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to conduct the subsequent phase of the proceedings.Gicheru is among the three Kenyans whom the international court had been looking for interfering with its witnesses in the cases against humanity related to the 2007-08 post-election violence.The Chamber additionally noted that the Prosecutor did not oppose Gicheru’s request for interim release together with conditions restricting liberty and that he is suspected of offences under article 70(1)(c) of the Rome Statute, consisting in corruptly influencing witnesses regarding cases from the situation in Kenya, which attract lower sanctions if established.Moreover, the Chamber is of the view that the risks mentioned under article 58(1)(b) of the Rome Statute may be adequately mitigated by imposing conditions restricting liberty.In the event that Gicheru would fail to comply with any of the conditions, the Chamber may declare the financial security provided by Gicheru forfeit to the Court.It may also issue a warrant of arrest in respect of Gicheru at the request of the Prosecutor or on its own initiative, and/or issue any other order it deems relevant in relation to a failure to comply with these conditions."
12,"Uhuru postpones Sagana meeting with Mt Kenya clergy, women leaders","President Uhuru Kenyatta has postponed his meeting with Clergy and Women Leaders from Central Kenya.The meeting that was scheduled for Monday at Sagana State Lodge was postponed to next week due to unavoidable circumstances.State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena said the new date and venue of the rescheduled meetings will be communicated in due course.This comes days after the president met Mt Kenya leaders at Sagana in a bid to quell the tension in the area and sell BBI.During his tour, Uhuru gave yet another indication that he might not support his deputy William Ruto when he told a parked delegation in Sagana that he owes no one.Speaking on Saturday when he met 5000 delegates from Mt Kenya region, the President said he is only indebted to the millions of Kenyans.“Some people keep saying I made a promise to them. No, I only have a promise and covenant with the people of Kenya,” the President said.The two leaders campaigned on a platform of Uhuru serving two terms and supporting DP for another two terms.Saturday's statement is a complete departure from his Friday’s statement when he appeared to be reinforcing his 2013 commitment of backing his deputy.On Friday, Uhuru told MCAs from the 10 counties of Central Kenya that he has never said he will not support his deputy."
13,MPs differ on best how to deal with Kapedo bandits,"Four MPs have differed on the best way the government should deal with banditry in Kapedo.Some said force should be used to disarm the bandits, while others said the government should initiate negotiations to end conflict and cattle rustling.The legislators were attending the burial of Emadau Tebakol, a senior GSU officer who was shot dead by suspected Pokot bandits on January 17.Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula said the decision by the government to use force may not yield much.“I want to advise security officers that you will never solve the problems of warring communities through force, because every piece of force will be countered by another piece of force,” he said.""I once worked closely with bishops in Kapedo, on the boundary between Pokot and Turkana, to bring peace. We succeeded in bringing harmony between Pokot and Turkana. The police should try bringing these communities together using soft power.”Wetang'ula said the conflict between Pokot and Turkana has persisted because the two communities are disadvantaged.The Bungoma senator said the government should initiate talks with warring communities and find a lasting solution to the problem that has persisted for decades.He said it was sad that Emadau was felled by the bullet in the line of duty.“Our brother was felled by a bullet and this could happen to anybody,” he said. Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka said a peaceful settlement to the conflict between warring communities would be the best way to end conflicts.“We do believe that it is much easier to negotiate a settlement with your enemy than to go and attack your enemy by force,” Onyonka said.“The government should employ retired security officers and ambassadors to go and negotiate with warring communities. We cannot have our people killed 55 years after Independence. It means there is something totally wrong with the way we manage our affairs.”The MP said peaceful methods of solving conflicts mean no lives will be lost compared to the use of force that usually leads to loss of lives and destruction of property.He said using force in conflict management may only compound the problem.But Baringo South MP Charles Kamuren and Nambale’s John Bunyasi insisted that the government should not negotiate with bandits.Kamuren said peaceful talks between the government and bandits have been conducted for many years, but the method has yielded little results.“The government should not allow Kenyans to kill one another and the government should not allow civilians to own guns to kill fellow civilians and police officers,” he said.Kamuren said the government has a mandate to end what is happening in Kapedo.""I have heard Senator Wetang'ula saying that the government should negotiate with these bandits. How do you negotiate with somebody with a gun? I want to invite Senator Wetang'ula to Baringo so that when the bandits shoot, we take cover together,” he said amid laughter.Kamuren said the money the government is investing in promoting the BBI process should be channelled to fund operations in Kapedo and other areas where communities are fighting each other.He said politicians should not be associated with the conflict in Kapedo “because politicians do not own guns”.The MP said anyone suspected of fuelling the conflict should be prosecuted according to the law.Bunyasi said the best available option for the government to deal with banditry is the use of force.“I don’t support the idea of negotiation. Even internationally, when you are going to negotiate, you must have force that is enough to bring people to the table to talk first,” the MP said.“We have lost senior officers and promising Kenyans in these conflicts. The government should tighten its operations in battle areas because they can’t be quarrelling there and killing our people.”Activist Okiya Omtatah said the government should adequately equip the police to be able to deal with banditry without strain.“The killing of Emadau is just a single story because there are hundreds of officers who have perished at the hands of bandits in the recent past,” he said.“Emadau went to a war zone. How was he equipped? Wasn’t there a budget? Why could he be given an armoured vehicle?”Emadau served as the head of operations at the GSU headquarters in Nairobi.He was shot dead by bandits who laid an ambush in the volatile Kapedo area. Three other officers were injured. The deceased was leading a team of security officers to counter bandits said to have laid a siege on a team from the Rapid Deployment Unit.The ambush happened in Ameyen area.Present at the burial were Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Mbugua, GSU Commandant Douglas Kanja, Western region police commander Peris Kimani, Baringo county commissioner Henry Wafula and Busia county police commander John Nyoike.Others included Busia county commissioner John Korir, Teso South MP Geoffrey Omuse, Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi and former Teso South MP Mary Emase."
14,Cops? Caning? How about God to end school unrest?,"The Education ministry is exploring introducing a dose of God through chaplaincy services in basic education to curb arson and unrest.The ministry is working on a framework under which chaplains can offer spiritual and moral guidance to learners in basic education. It is working with the National Committee on Chaplaincy.Acting director for field coordination Hassan Duale said the ministry is working with Faith-Based Organisations to develop rules and guidelines on chaplaincy.Schools have been torn by unrest, protest, property destruction and arson since schools reopened in January after a 10-month Covid pandemic break.Teachers have been attacked.Students in many schools are running amok; many oppose the upcoming exams.Duale was addressing a workshop on chaplaincy guidelines in basic education institutions. He also discussed and health and safety protocols for chaplaincy services during the pandemic.He spoke at the Kigali Teachers Training College in Embu County .The rash of unrest is undermining preparations for the KDPE and KCSE exams.With fewer than 60 days to the start of the national examinations, preparations have entered the homestretch.Stakeholders have called for intervention to arrest the situation.In the past week alone, dormitories in at least six schools have gone up in flames.The schools include Kisii High, Bukembe Boys' High in Bungoma, Kirimari and Kiambere secondary schools in Embu county, Kisumu School, and Itigo Girls in Nandi.  Nicholas Maiyo, the Kenya Parents Association chairman, has warned that more schools could witness unrest in February.Maiyo said teachers were inadequately prepared for the reopening, leading to a disconnect with learners who had been out of school for 10 months.""A child coming back to class after 10 months is not the same child a teacher was dealing with in March last year... Some of them (students) engage in word exchange with their parents and when you impose rules and orders on them in school, the result is confrontation and even riots,"" Maiyo said.Duale said the Ministry and Faith-Based Organisations look forward to ensuring t chaplains help students to cope with the ambiguities and complexities of life. He said the inability to cope with stress and anxieties can disorient students who engage in self-destructive behavior.He said the presence of chaplains will provide a listening ear and a caring presence for learners grappling with a crisis of one kind or another.Duale said spiritual and moral guidance from chaplains will help learners avoid behaviour that is destructive to them and others, including schools and society at large.Duale said the National Committee on Chaplains Services draws membership from Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims, National Council of Churches of Kenya, National Conference of Catholic Bishops, Seventh-day Adventists, Evangelical Alliance of Kenya, Presbyterian Church of East Africa, HINDU Council, and the Ministry of Education.Duale said the committee is  developing draft guidelines for the provision of chaplains services in schools for consideration and validation by stakeholders before it can be rolled out.(Edited by V.

15,Women at high risk of HIV can use vaginal ring - WHO,"Women at high risk of HIV infection can use the Dapivirine Ring as a new choice to prevent HIV.The World Health Organization has recommended use of the ring as an additional prevention choice for women at substantial risk of HIV infection. It's recommended as part of a combined prevention approach. It is intended for use by women aged 18 and older in developing countries. It was not immediately known when or how it would be available; it is cost-effective but the cost is also not known. The global health agency had included the ring - known as DPV-VR - on its prequalification list of medicines in November last year.Approval followed a positive scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency on the use of the DPV-VR in July last year.The ring slowly releases Dapivirine for 28 days and is effective one day after insertion. After 28 days it should be replaced.A study led by the International Partnership For Microbicides found that the ring reduced overall risk by 35 per cent among women using it.It delivers medication directly at the site of potential infection and there is no significant absorption by the entire system. The device is well-tolerated, researchers said.The ring can be used as pre-exposure prophylaxis when women lack access to or cannot use oral PrEP.PrEP -pre-exposure prophylaxis - is medication, usually pills taken daily by HIV-negative individuals to block them from acquiring the virus. Injectible versions are available.WHO said: ""When providing HIV prevention services for women it is important to provide them alongside other services. These include other other HIV prevention choices, STI diagnosis and treatment, HIV tests and links to ART for all women who test positive and a range of contraception methods.""“Research is underway to develop a vaginal ring that includes both contraception and HIV prevention, the WHO added.Two Phase III studies  in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe found that the ring method reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection in women and was well tolerated with long- term use.Dapivirine reduces the risk of HIV-1 infection after 24 hours of ring insertion.International Partnership For Microbicides CEO Dr Zeda Rosenberg said the  ring can provide a comprehensive HIV prevention method that could help avert infections not be prevented by another method.“These findings give hope to many women at high risk who need more and different options to effectively protect themselves from HIV,” Rosenberg said.“They should replace it with a new one every 28 days as soon as the previous one is removed to maintain its efficacy.”Women in the study were randomly assigned to two study groups, one used the Dapirivine Ring and the other a placebo ring that contained no drug.A WHO Guidelines Development Group said that the benefits of the method outweigh disadvantages based scientific evidence.It said the ring is cost-effective, acceptable, has demonstrated feasibility and has the potential to increase equity as an additional choice.The research however noted variability in the ring's effectiveness in younger women. Data among pregnant and breastfeeding women was limited.(Edited by V, Graham)"
16,Speaker Muturi joins race to succeed Uhuru in Mt Kenya,"Details have emerged of a fresh push by Mt Kenya leaders for National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta as the region's supremo.The Star has also established that those backing the speaker are also going flat out to package him as a 2022 presidential candidate.The idea is that the 64-year-old speaker is ""a safe pair of hands to bring the community together'.Muturi has been approached by the Njuri Nceke Council of Elders, the Kiama Kiama Kikuyu Council of Elders, the Embu and Mbeere Cultural Elders, as well as religious leaders.Several MPs, not only from the speaker’s Mt Kenya East backyard but also from other counties in Central, have joined the push.The feeling is that it is time their 'cousins from the West' returned a helping hand and supported a leader from the East.The Star has further learned that Speaker Muturi has been busy lately, ostensibly buoyed by the pressure to vie for kingpin - at least. His first public appearance after a lull was at the Saturday's Sagana meeting, the last having been the burial of former Cooperatives minister Joe Nyagah.However, the speaker was not present when President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the tax laws Parliament had just passed in a special sitting a day before.The Star has reliably established the National Assembly boss was involved in events in his backyard towards consolidating the vote bloc.The Star can authoritatively report the Kiama Kia Ma (Agikuyu Council of Elders) hosted Muturi at their residence where the succession plan was discussed.An elaborate plan was presented to present him as the region’s spokesman anytime next month.After the Sagana event, they held a four-hour meeting with the President, panicking those aiming to be named kingpin.The Muturi development will intensify Uhuru's dilemma in appointing a successor to steer the region’s interests after he exits office.Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, Agriculture CS Peter Munya, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, former Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri and Narc Kenya's Martha Karua want to wear the Mt Kenya mantle.Deputy President William Ruto, ODM leader Raila Odinga, ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka all covet the region's votes.This could signify they'd prefer a running mate from Mt Kenya, hence the jostling.Even as the President moved to consolidate his base, the succession intrigues have narrowed to infighting between two senior members of his Cabinet – one from Mt Kenya East and the other from Mt Kenya West.The tension played out on Friday night to the extent that there was an attempt to lock Muturi out of the Sagana meeting.Muturi was not invited by the organisers — largely civil servants — but it now turns out he was to be in the programme and the President wanted him to attend.The seating arrangement also did not factor in the Speaker’s presence. His seat was later placed behind the President.   As the third in command, it was expected his seat would be beside the President.Instead, Uhuru was sandwiched between Cabinet secretaries Kagwe and Munya.A senior official who was at Sagana and well aware of the intrigues told the Stat on Sunday the infighting led to alteration of the programme. Only grassroots leaders and the President addressed the gathering.Kagwe was to speak for Mt Kenya West, Munya for the East and then Muturi was to invite the President to speak. This plan was shelved.Igembe North MP Maoke Maore was thus tasked to mobilise MPs, apparently owing to his rivalry with House Majority leader Amos Kimunya.Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru was tasked to manage senators instead of Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata.Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui was in charge of his counterparts, a role that would ordinarily be handled by Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia.Munya took charge of the civil servants.It was expected that the meeting would end with the crowning of an interim kingpin but that never materialised.President Kenyatta thus restated he was still in charge and that he’d continue leading the region at the negotiations table.Though the President says he’s still in charge, pundits say the region faces a leadership vacuum after his retirement.“From these events, many of us are recognising to the reality that succession politics is complicated and a more acceptable candidate across the board needs to be propped up,” an official said.Since no one was named as earlier planned, Muturi’s camp believes he has the skills, experience and support s to lead the region after the President retires.They cite his acceptability seen whenever he called the region’s leaders to a meeting – a recent one where he hosted Kimunya, Munya, Kenneth and other leaders for lunch. Those fronting Muturi say that being the third in command, he is best placed and well above the Cabinet secretaries.Nominated MP Cecily Mbarire confirmed that “the conversation to make Muturi kingpin started early last year and is beginning to gain traction this year.""“We are positioning him as a would-be successor but as we move along, we will be able to know where to go,"" Mbarire said.The ex-deputy Majority Whip said they will be studying the support patterns for other candidates before making the final move.“As we move along, I am sure he will be listening to what the leaders have to say. We also want to make our interests known to him. He should expect people to be talking to him,"" Mbairie said.She said Muturi is their favourite because of his wealth of experience and his good relations across the board. He is not an extremist and has not rubbed people the wrong way, she said.“He is readily acceptable. Look at how he has run Parliament, keeping members together despite the divisive politics. He stands to bring us together as a region,” Mbarire said.In recent media interviews, Muturi said he will neither run for Embu governor nor seek a running mate position. He asked, “Why not President?”Muturi and Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi are the senior most politicians from the Mt Kenya region - in the absence of President Kenyatta.However, the Meru governor is said to be keen to retaining his gubernatorial seat, leaving Muturi as the region’s most viable option in the succession battle.Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni said jostling was unnecessary as the community still has a spokesperson and kingpin.“In our region, we are not in the habit of installing people and I don’t expect that to happen this Saturday,"" he had said, referring to the conference.“Political spokespeople just naturally appear by the way they conduct themselves and the leadership they give without being called to do so,” Kioni said.Long-serving Maara MP Kareke Mbiuki told the Star, ""It is time for another region within the Gema community to offer leadership.“As we approach 2022, and beyond, we need to have groomed a leader who can negotiate stakes on behalf of the community,” he said.Mbiuki said Muturi can thus be the Gema nation representative to negotiate with other national leaders to form a government.""It is not being tribal and we continue supporting  Uhuru until he completes his term.“Mwai Kibaki took over from Kenneth Matiba, whereas Uhuru took over from Kibaki. Question is, after Uhuru, who can lead the Gema nation?” Mbiuki posed.“We have no problem engaging like-minded persons once President Kenyatta exits. We are not waiting for him to anoint anybody. We are not being selfish.”Mbiuki said they fear that beyond 2022, “The centre may not be holding for Mt Kenya.”His Kabete counterpart, Githua Wamacukuru, said, “I don’t know if there is such a plan but I can say Muturi is a good leader. “He is a man of the people. We love him, even in Parliament. He is accommodative, hence, would be easy to sell to wananchi,” the MP added.Kamau wa Njoroge of the Kiama Kia Ma Kikuyu Council of Elders said everybody in the country has a right to occupy the top seat.“One only needs to convince the people that he is able because power is with the people. And yes, Muturi is fit; very capable and is not tainted in any way,” the elder said.“People in this country want someone who is not tainted, who they feel can deliver. They want someone who is not into politics but the management of this country.”Njuri Nceke’s Makunyi Kirebu called Muturi ""a national leader who is not tainted like others"".“People want him to take the mantle of leading our country. Those others are bloated. His time is now.”Kirebu said that once the speaker comes out to declare his bid, the other bigwigs will have to listen to him.Muturi has worked with President Daniel Moi and later was  chairman of the Public Investments Committee during Mwai Kibaki’s first term.Mugambi Imanyara, a renowned lawyer, said whatever is being touted would depend on the speaker’s decision.Political analyst Dennis Nthumbi said it was time Mt Kenya backed a leader from the East.“The Kikuyu may also want to take a break and organise their internal affairs and, therefore, for the first time perhaps let the able Embians…lead them for a century.”It is not the first time a son of Mbeere, where Muturi hails from, is being considered as a possible successor in Mt Kenya politics.Jeremiah Nyaga, a longtime ally of Mzee Jomo Kenyatta was considered in the Mt Kenya succession battle even as their kins from Mt Kenya West lobbied to get one of their own appointed by President Moi as the Vice President.(Edited by V.

17,Death toll rises as eight more succumb to virus,"The country’s death toll due to Covid-19 continued to rise after eight more patients succumbed to the virus on Sunday.The new deaths reported by the Health Ministry pushed the fatalities to 1,763.Ninety eight more people tested positive for the virus from a sample size of 3,739 tested in 24 hours, representing a positivity rate of 2.6 per cent. The virus caseload now stands at 100,773.The total tests conducted in the country since the onset of the pandemic to date now stands at 1,186,951. Of the new cases, 12 were foreign nationals.“There are 471 patients currently admitted in various health facilities countrywide, while 1,408 are on home based isolation and care. Twenty five patients are in the intensive care unit, 14 of whom are on ventilator support and 11 on supplemental oxygen,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said in a statement.“Another 16 patients are separately on supplemental oxygen with 13 of them in the general wards and three in the high dependency unit,” he added.Data from the ministry shows that 52 patients recovered from the disease on Sunday, 29 from various health facilities and 23 from the home based care programme.This pushes the number of recoveries in the country to 83,907.Eighty six of the new cases were from Nairobi distributed as follows: Starehe with 48, Westlands with nine, Dagoretti North with seven, Kibra with three and Embakasi central,  Embakasi East, Embakasi West, Makadara, Mathare and Ruaraka registering two cases each.Other subcounties in Nairobi that recorded cases include Dagoretti South, Embakasi North, Embakasi South, Kamukunji, Kasarani, Lang’ata and Roysambu which had one case each.Meru had two cases all from Imenti North, same as Mombasa with two cases from Mvita while Nakuru had two cases from Naivasha and Nakuru."
18,Kenya and DRC exploring visa-free entries to strengthen ties,"Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo are working on a visa-free entry deal, according to a statement by the Interior ministry.The ministry said the move will promote bilateral trade and advance the intra-African economic integration and regional cooperation agenda.“This follows extensive deliberations between delegations from the two countries, led by Dr Fred Matiang'i and Hon Gilbert Kankonde Malamba, DR Congo's Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of Interior, Security and Customary Affairs,” said a statement released on Friday.The two countries will form an inter-ministerial team to begin the process of facilitating visa-free entries by citizens from either country.""The team comprising experts from both Kenya and the DRC will also look into areas of mutual collaboration for the good of the region,"" CS Matiang'i said.This comes at a time when DRC’s application to join the East African Community remains undetermined.President Felix Tshisekedi formally applied for admission to the six-member bloc in June 2019—three months after he assumed office.“This request follows the ever-increasing trade between the economic players of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and those of the states of the community,” he wrote on June 8.He said it was the desire of his new government to join EAC leaders “so we can work together for the development of our respective countries and stabilise this part of Africa"".DRC’s bid has, however, been frustrated by the postponement of EAC heads of state summit owing to lack of quorum. The February 2020 meeting should have made it possible to develop a timetable for the consideration of the request.The DRC accounts for about six per cent of total exports from the EAC region.During Tshisekedi's visit to Nairobi in February 2019, President Uhuru Kenyatta noted that a lot of Congolese imports pass through Mombasa port, especially goods destined for Goma and Lubumbashi in eastern DRC, and called for the deepening of trade ties going forward."
19,"Stop politicking and focus on economy, Mudavadi urges","ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has warned that the country risked sinking deeper into recession if leaders concentrate on non-productive political activities.He said the more leaders focus on politics the longer it will take the country to address joblessness and higher taxation. “We should get our country to focus on the right issues. We need a unity of purpose and then focus on turning the economy round. We must find a way of ending auctioneer businesses which are hurting everybody,” he stated.There have been heightened political activities across the country as leaders move around to drumming up support for or opposing a review of the Constitution.Kenya slid into a recession for the first time in two decades in the third quarter of 2020.Gross domestic product fell 1.1 per cent compared to a year earlier, after shrinking a revised 5.5 per cent in the second quarter, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.Measures introduced to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic have been partly been blamed for the state of the economy.Speaking on Sunday during a service at House of Grace Church in Nairobi, Mudavadi said the country’s huge public debt is burdening all Kenyans. “The debt translates into more taxation which affects the ordinary business person and everybody else,” he added.He said the country had reached a stage where the debate around the Building Bridges Initiative needs to be put to an end.“It is important that we put a closure to the BBI debate. This issue needs to be dispensed with so that Kenyans can focus on other things. We cannot have this debate on the table permanently,” he stated.He said Kenyans want changes to the Constitution but also want their economic hardships addressed urgently.“I am sure the concern of everybody beyond the BBI is the economy. We must create wealth, we must create jobs. We must move away from glorifying poverty because we all want to get out of poverty as a nation,” he added.He appealed to the media to play is role in driving the country in the right direction.“Don’t promote those who insult others and leave out people who speak sense. Call us out systematically,” he urged.Mudavadi further appealed to Kenyans to elect people who abide by Chapter Six of the Constitution on ethics and integrity.“Increase the number of good leaders during the next elections. When you vote, make sure the number of good leaders increases tenfold,” he added."
20,Ongwae praises UK for funding market project to ease congestion,"Kisii Governor James Ongwae has praised the UK for funding construction of a Sh1.5 billion anti-Covid-19-compliant market at Daraja Mbili and other projects.Ongwae said his administration will not wish away the gesture as the market will help in reducing congestion in the central business district and curb the spread of Covid.“I'm grateful to the British government for its support in starting the noble project, which is not only aimed at reducing congestion but also curbing the pandemic,” he told the Star on the phone.Kisii town, which is one of the highly congested towns, was elevated to a municipality in 2018 through a Gazette Notice Number 1236 of November 30.The pilot market which will be built under Britain’s Sustainable Urban Economic Development (SUED) programme and will support the county economy through trade and taxes.Ongwae said his administration has the interest of traders at heart, hence focussed on championing an enabling business environment.“I want to see all traders conduct their business in a friendly environment. They need to make good profits because they pay tax,” he said.During the groundbreaking ceremony, SUED team leader Duncan Onyango said the market will accommodate 2,250 traders. He said the works will be in three phases, with the first phase projected to cost between Sh20 million and Sh30 million.He said similar projects will be implemented in other areas. “The market is expected to be complete within 60 days to enable traders to move there to conduct their businesses,” he said.The market will also decongest the Daraja Mbili market, which is the second largest in the Western region after Kibuye in Kisumu. Ongwae urged the contractor to complete the project within the stipulated period."
21,Psychologist calls for mental health lessons to end school unrest,"A consultant clinical psychologist has called for the strengthening of mental health programmes in schools to curb violence and unrest.Dr Rose Otieno, also a lecturer at Kisii University, blamed attacks on teachers by students and torching of facilities on change in character.“Some of the incidents where learners attack their teachers and burn schools can be attributed to lack of mental health lessons in schools,” Otieno told the Star by phone.She urged national and county health officials to come up with a programme that will ensure learners receive mental health lessons.“I'm advocating professional counselling in schools to enable the learners to understand the situations they undergo. We need not wait until incidents occur in order to intervene,” Otieno said.The prolonged closure of schools due to Covid-19 had a negative impact on students and triggered mental health problems, she said.She noted that some children and adolescents suffered depressive disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, substance use disorders and conduct disorders.“Some children also experienced anxiety disorders, including phobias, separation anxiety disorders and sleep-wake disorders. A number of children also experienced neuro-developmental disorders, among them disorders of communication, reading and mathematics, often classified under special needs,” the don said.She said adolescents’ characters changed because of confinement at home for the nine months they were out of school, thus prompting psychological stressors upon interaction with peers and teachers.When children are exposed to a large amount of negative information, like in the case of Covid reporting, they experience a high level of stress and anxiety in the adults around them leading to psychological distress, Otieno said.She added that some parents were preoccupied with the impact of Covid-19 and failed to effectively respond to their children’s cues of distress.“Children are often attuned to adults' emotional state, including their emotional distress. If the adults displayed unexplained behaviour during the Covid period, then the children perceived the same as a threat,” she said."
22,"Covid: Israel to transfer 5,000 vaccine doses to Palestinians","Israel says it is transferring 5,000 doses of Covid vaccine to immunise frontline Palestinian health workers.Israel has one of the most advanced vaccination programmes in the world but Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza have yet to see one.UN experts say Israel has a responsibility for vaccinations there.Israel says that is not part of agreed protocols and it has not received any requests from the Palestinians. This is its first such transfer.Israel has recorded some 640,000 Covid cases since the pandemic began, and just over 4,700 deaths, Johns Hopkins University research shows. There have been almost 160,000 cases in the West Bank and Gaza, with 1,833 deaths, the research shows.Israel's special deal with vaccine supplier Pfizer - Israel is providing vital medical data in return for a quick rollout - has helped it to become the country that has inoculated more people per head of population than any other.Some 1.7 million people, almost 20% of the population, have already received both doses. More than three million people have received the first. However, the country remains under lockdown.The office of Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz confirmed on Sunday that Israel would make the transfer to the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians have not yet commented.What is the situation in the territories?Neither the West Bank, whose limited self-rule is run by the Palestinian Authority, nor Gaza, controlled by militant Islamist movement Hamas, has started vaccination programmes.Palestinian health officials say deals are being negotiated for vaccine supplies but it is unclear when they will start.The territories also hope to benefit from the World Health Organization-backed Covax scheme, to supply vaccines to poorer states and nations, but again timings are unknown.A few thousand Russian-made vaccines have arrived but is unclear who they have gone to.About 2.7 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, and another 1.8 million in Gaza.Whose responsibility is it to vaccinate Palestinians?Israel points to the Oslo accords, agreed in 1993 and 1995, which set out how parts of the West Bank and Gaza would be governed under an interim framework until a permanent peace settlement can be reached.It says these give the Palestinian Authority oversight of public health under the principles of self-determination.The Palestinians say those accords also say Israel should co-operate in combating epidemics and contagious diseases.UN experts say the Geneva Convention on occupied territories takes priority over these accords and it is Israel's responsibility to provide equitable access to vaccines for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.But international law experts disagree on this and on many other issues surrounding the occupied territories.Israel's extensive vaccination drive does include Israel's Arab citizens and Palestinians living in annexed east Jerusalem.On Friday the WHO warned against ""vaccine nationalism"", saying there was a ""real danger that the very tools that could help to end the pandemic - vaccines - may exacerbate"" global inequality."
23,"Over 107,000 students from frontier counties drop from school","Over 107,000 students have dropped from schools in ten frontier counties due to Covid-19 pandemic, with fears that the numbers could rise due to ongoing drought and insecurity.According to the Frontier Counties Development Council (FCDC), the education sector has been hardest hit in the counties with close to 1.3m school going children remaining at home or in the fields.This emerged at the end of a two day retreat for governors from the ten counties in Enashipai Resort in Naivasha.Addressing the press, the chair of the council Ali Roba, who is also Mandera Governor, identified lack of teachers as the main challenge currently facing the education sector.Of the counties, Mandera is the most affected with 265,000 students out of class followed by Garissa (255,000), Wajir (237,000), Turkana (224,000) and Marsabit with over 94,000 students.“In the ten counties over 1,295,000 students are out of school while another 107,556 dropped from classes due to the ongoing pandemic,” he said.He revisited the move by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to withdraw teachers from Mandera, Wajir and Garissa on security grounds as the biggest blow to them.“Currently we face a shortage of 3,010 teachers in primary schools and another 437 in secondary schools and we are asking the President to intervene on this,” he said.Flanked by fellow governors, Roba added that the ongoing drought had affected hundreds of families with fears that lives could be lost in the coming months.He said that they were currently feeling the pain from the dry spell adding that they faced some tough and challenging months before the on-set of long rains.“Our counties are actively trucking water to save people and animals and this requires extra funding that keeps water flowing through affected areas,” he said.On locust invasion, the governor added that the frontier counties were the hardest hit with the swarms leaving trails of destruction in farms and homes.He called on the Ministry of Devolution to extend food relief support to help plug the gaps in food security so as to complement efforts of respective county governments and partners.“We applaud efforts by the National Government through the Ministry of Agriculture and FAO in mitigating the impacts of the destructive pest,” he said.The council at the same time expressed its concern over deteriorating peace and pointed to Kapedo, Isiolo-Wajir and the Wajir-Garissa clashes as the recent cases.“We are witnessing increasing incidents of violent extremism and sighting of terror cells particularly in Mandera, Wajir and Garissa and we cannot allow this,” he said.Present during the retreat were Governors Mohamud Ali (Marsabit), Josephat Nanok (Turkana), Moses Lenool kulal (Samburu), Dhadho Godhana (Tana River) among others."
24,Take charge of your future - Uhuru urges youth,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged the youth to take charge of their future as he rallied them to support the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).Saying the country’s young people have the potential to propel the country to the next level of progress, the President cautioned them against falling prey to politicians dishing out handouts and spreading falsehoods against BBI.“Come on, be awake and take control of your future because if you don’t, the people who will suffer the most is you and you will not have anyone to blame but yourself.The Head of State spoke on Sunday at Sagana State Lodge in Nyeri County where he engaged the youth from Mt Kenya and its neighbouring Counties on issues affecting them.At the same time, Uhuru encouraged the youth to be focused and go for national leadership positions to build on the development momentum the country has gained.“Brothers and sisters, the country has a bright future. We have laid a solid foundation that has been built on previous foundations. Don’t destroy that foundation in search of false hope. Protect it,"" he told the over 700 young people.Noting that the youth represent close to 70 percent of the country’s population, the president said they deserve more opportunities as proposed in the BBI document.He asked all leaders to work together and put in place an enabling environment and the right policies to end poverty.The president said the proposed reforms contained in the BBI document will fix the constitutional gaps in the 2010 Constitution and provide permanent solutions to the challenges facing the country especially the youth.He emphasized the need for institutional change and a change of mindset that will enable the youth to be self sufficient and independent.“There are institutional problems in our country that must be resolved. If we don’t resolve these institutional problems, we are not going to resolve the problem of poverty and we are not going to meet the expectations of our young people. It is not possible,” Uhuru said.Speaking during the meeting, the youth assured the head of state that they will stand firm behind him in support of BBI.They extolled the benefits contained in the proposed changes that include exemption of youthful entrepreneurs from paying taxes for a period of seven years from the moment they register their business.The youths, who included CAS Zack Kinuthia and Commissioner Wambui Nyutu, also applauded BBI, saying it will help the country to achieve the two thirds gender rule.“We will market the document to the rest of the youth in the country because it represents our aspirations,” Commissioner Wambui Nyutu said.Earlier, President Kenyatta made an impromptu inspection visit of the new Shs 1 billion Chaka Market shortly after attending Sunday Mass at the neighbouring Arch Angel Michael Chaka Catholic Parish.Speaking to jubilant Chaka Town residents who turned up to receive him, the Head of State said the Shs 1 billion modern market which is 98 percent complete will transform livelihoods in the area by providing a conducive environment for traders to do business and farmers to sell their produce."
25,"Navalny, WHO, Thunberg among nominees for Nobel Peace Prize","Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, the World Health Organization and climate campaigner Greta Thunberg are among those nominated for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, all backed by Norwegian lawmakers who have a track record of picking the winner.Thousands of people, from members of parliaments worldwide to former winners, are eligible to propose candidates. Nominations, which close on Sunday, do not imply an endorsement from the Nobel committee.Norwegian lawmakers have nominated the eventual laureate every year since 2014, with the exception of 2019, said Henrik Urdal, Director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo. “The pattern from recent years is quite stunning.”The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.But nominators can choose to reveal their picks.According to a Reuters survey of Norwegian lawmakers, nominees include Thunberg, Navalny, the WHO and its COVAX programme to secure fair access to COVID-19 vaccines for poor countries.Thunberg was named as one of “the foremost spokespeople in the fight against the climate crisis”, with the campaigning group she co-founded, Fridays for Future, also receiving a nod.Navalny, nominated by Russian academics, was named for his “efforts for a peaceful democratisation of Russia” by Norwegian former minister Ola Elvestuen.The battle against COVID-19 is front and centre, including a nomination for the GAVI vaccine alliance.Other names are Belarusian activists Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Maria Kolesnikova and Veronika Tsepkalo for their “fight for a fair election and inspiration for peaceful resistance”, one nominator, Geir Sigbjoern Toskedal, said.Another, Jette Christensen, also named the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, and IUSTITIA, a group of Polish judges defending civil rights.“My nomination this year is ... for the fight to preserve democracy as a form of government in Europe,” Christensen said.Freedom of information is a recurring theme with nominees including the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists; former Charlie Hebdo journalist Zineb el Rhazoui; news website Hong Kong Free Press, the U.S.-based International Fact-Checking Network and Paris-based Reporters without Borders (RSF).Other nominees include former U.S. President Donald Trump, NATO and the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR).Also on the list is Aminatou Haidar, for her peaceful campaigning towards an independent Western Sahara, the International Space Station and the International Scout Movement.The 2021 laureate will be announced in October."
26,No one has my political debt - Ruto,"Deputy President William Ruto has said no one has his political debt.He said the only debt he has is that of helping President Uhuru Kenyatta unite and transform Kenya.“I supported President Kenyatta in 2013 and 2017 without conditions. The Head of State should not be pushed to backing my 2022 candidature,” he said.Ruto spoke on Sunday in Trans-Mara, Narok County, during a prayer service.He was accompanied by Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok, Narok Deputy Governor Evalyn Aruasa, David Sankok (nominated), Gabriel Tongoyo (Narok West), Lemanken Aramat (Narok East), Soipan Tuya (Narok), Johana Ngeno (Emurrua Dikirr), Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu), Gideon Koskei (Chepalungu), Florence Jematia (EALA) and Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira).Ruto said he would not allow Kenya to be taken back to ethnic-based politics that is not only risky but dangerous to the social fabric of the country.“I decline the invitation to the politics of tribe. We are one country and need to move forward together, our backgrounds notwithstanding,” he explained.He asked leaders to stop being disturbed by the so-called politics of debt.The deputy president argued that he was engaging in politics not because of the alleged debts but because of his vision to empower ordinary Kenyans.“Let us unite and work together to better the lives of millions of Kenyans struggling at the base of the wealth pyramid,"" Ruto said.He said gone were the days when leaders would look for positions through back-door.“Let us sell our ideas and policies to the people. That is the only way that they can rally behind us,” he added.This is the second time that Ruto insists that no one owes him politically.In June 2019 in Nyandarua County, he said that no community in Kenya owed him anything.Then, he said the debt leaders had was to serve Kenyans.“The only obligation that we have is to fulfill the promises we made to the people; that of transforming their lives,” he noted.The MPs said they had decided to combine efforts with the Deputy President because of his development track-record.Insisting that leaders should stop the politics of ethnicity, the MPs added that they would back Ruto in the 2022 polls."
27,98 new cases as eight succumb to Covid-19,"Kenya on Sunday recorded 98 new cases, from a sample size of 3,739 tested in the last 24 hours.This brings the total number of cases to 100,773, with the cumulative tests standing at 1,186,951.From the cases, 86 are Kenyans while 12 are foreigners, with 82 being males and 16 females.Age wise, the youngest is a 10-year-old child while the oldest is 85 years old.In terms of recoveries, 52 patients have recovered from the disease with 29 from various health facilities while 23 are from the home based program.The total number of recoveries are now at 83,907.Sadly, eight patients have succumbed to the disease raising the number of fatalities to 1,763.There are 471 patients currently admitted in various health facilities countrywide, while 1,408 are on home based isolation and care.Twenty-five patients are in ICU, 14 of whom are on ventilatory support and 11 on supplemental oxygen.Another 16 patients are separately on supplementary oxygen with 13 of them in the general wards and three in the High Dependency Unit.In terms of county distribution, Nairobi has 86 cases, Meru, Mombasa and Nakuru with two cases each, while Busia, Kajiado, Kiambu, Kisumu, Machakos and Nyeri have one case each"
28,"Russia detains over 1,000 at protests against jailing of Kremlin critic Navalny","Police detained more than 1,000 people and broke up rallies in Moscow and across Russia on Sunday as supporters of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny took to the streets to protest his jailing, despite biting cold and the threat of arrest.The nationwide rallies follow large protests last weekend that is part of a campaign to pressure the Kremlin into freeing President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent.The opposition politician was arrested on January 17 after returning to Moscow from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in Russia last summer.He accuses Putin of ordering his murder, which the Kremlin denies.Police in Moscow detained at least 100 people as the rallies began under snowfall around 0900 GMT amid a huge police presence, Reuters reporters said.OVD-Info, a protest monitoring group said police had detained 1,009 people nationwide.Yulia, a 40-year-old protester in Moscow, said she had come to the protests despite having a panic attack the night before because of worrying about repercussions for taking part.""I understand that I live in a totally lawless state. In a police state, with no independent courts. In a country ruled by corruption. I would like to live differently,"" she said.Police have said the protests were illegal as they had not been authorised and would be broken up. Authorities have said demonstrators could spread COVID-19.Crowds of protesters were scattered about in Moscow after the organisers twice changed the planned gathering point as police took highly unusual steps to seal off pedestrian access to areas of the capital and shut down metro stations.Police put turnout at the Moscow protest at around 300 people.In the far eastern city of Vladivostok, police prevented protesters from accessing the city centre, forcing them to relocate to the waterfront by the frozen Amur Bay.Video footage showed protesters chanting ""Putin is a thief"" as they linked hands and marched on the ice in temperatures of around -13 Celsius (8.6 Fahrenheit). Police detained more than 100 people in the city, OVD-Info said.In Tomsk, the Siberian city that Navalny visited before suddenly collapsing on a domestic flight last August, demonstrators gathered in front of a concert hall and chanted ""Let him go!"".Dozens turned out in the east Siberian city of Yakutsk despite temperatures of -42 C (-44 F).""This is the first time I've come to a protest. I'm just fed up with the total lawlessness of the authorities,"" said Ivan, a protester who declined to give his surname.SUPPORT TESTThe protest is a test of Navalny's support after many of his prominent allies were targeted in a crackdown this week. Several, including his brother Oleg, are under house arrest.""If we stay quiet, then they could come for any of us tomorrow,"" Yulia Navalnaya, the Kremlin critic's wife, wrote on Instagram.Navalny, 44, is accused of parole violations which he says are trumped up. A court is due to meet next week to consider handing him a jail term of up to three and a half years.The West has told Moscow to let Navalny go and his allies have appealed to U.S. President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on 35 people who they say are Putin's close allies.Seeking to galvanise supporters at home, Navalny put out an online video this month that has been viewed over 100 million times, accusing Putin of being the ultimate owner of a sumptuous Black Sea palace. The Kremlin leader has denied this.On the eve of the protests, Arkady Rotenberg, a businessman and Putin's former judo sparring partner, said he owns the property.(Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber, Anton Zverev, Polina Ivanova, Maria Tsvetkova, Polina Nikolskaya, Katya Golubkova, Dmitry Turlyun and Anastasia Adasheva Writing by Tom Balmforth Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Frances Kerry, Raissa Kasolowsky, Alexandra Hudson)"
29,PSC fails to renew contracts of Nairobi health care workers hired to combat Covid-19,"A number of health care workers across Nairobi health centres are set to lose their job after the Public Service Commission failed to extend their contracts.Nairobi Metropolitan Service has highlighted that health workers had been recruited by the PSC for a period of three and six months to help combat the Coronavirus pandemic.NMS Director for Health Service Dr Josephine Mbae in a letter to all county superintendents revealed that some health care workers were still working despite the expiry of their contracts.“As you are aware the Public Service Commission recruited healthcare workers to work on short contracts of three and six months to help combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of these contracts have expired or are due to expire soon,” reads the letter dated January 22, 2021.“It has been noted that some of the healthcare workers are still on duty despite the expiry of their contracts,” reads the letter in part.Dr Kibae noted PSC had renewed no contract therefore all the medical superintendents should ensure that the health workers whose contracts had expired cease performing their duties after the expiry of their contracts.In May last year, NMS, through the PSC recruited 225 health workers after President Uhuru Kenyatta announced last month that an additional 5,000 personnel will be hired as the country intensifies the battle against the pandemic.The recruited cadres were doctors, nurses and clinical officers. They will serve on three-year contracts.NMS noted that when they took over from City Hall there was indeed a shortage of health workers and many hospitals relied on locum.“We had to recruit more. The NMS has come up with a distribution plan so that once they get the appointment letters they know where to report,” Mbae said."
30,NMS to commission Mathare-Korogocho Level 5 Hospital in April,"Residents in Mathare North will start receiving health services from the newly built Mathare- Korogocho Level Five Hospital in May.This comes as the Nairobi Metropolitan Service aims to commission the hospital in April as construction works end in March. NMS Director-General Mohammed Badi on Saturday said that after the infrastructural bit is complete, NMS will embark on employing staff.“NMS will start employing health workers; doctors, nurses and other staff to cater for the hospital to be operational hopefully by the end of April if we receive the money to buy the equipment,"" he said.It is expected that the hospital will have more than 300 workers drawn from different cadres of health professionals.Badi revealed that the process of procurement for equipment was already ongoing after NMS following a request the National Government to set aside funds for the purchase of hospital equipment.The newly-built Mathare-Korogocho hospital will be a five-storey building with Badi revealing it will have its own Intensive Care Unit (ICU), patient admission wards, pharmacy, morgue, kidney dialysis centre and theatres.The facility will be at the same level as Mama Lucy Hospital which is also being upgraded by the Badi-led team.Works at the Mathare- Korogocho facility commenced in July after President Uhuru Kenyatta directed  NMS to upgrade it.Consequently, Sh400 million was set aside for the purpose of rehabilitating the health facility that had stalled since the early 1990s.In 2014, a report by the County Government of Nairobi revealed that there were 76 public health facilities inclusive of health centres and dispensaries.However, access to health services had been a pipe dream to many city residents living in the informal settlements.As a result, NMS pledged to build 24 hospitals in Nairobi’s informal settlements. According to DG Badi, the additional hospitals will help reduce the burden on Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Mama Lucy, Pumwani and  Mbagathi Hospitals.The hospitals are in Viwandani, Majengo, Mathare, Kayole, Soweto, Korogocho, Kawangware, Gitare Marigu, Mukuru Kwa Njenga, Mukuru Kwa Reuben, Kibera and Githurai 44.Nine out of the 24 health facilities would be built from scratch while the rest (five) would be rehabilitated.Ten of the facilities to be built will be Level 2 hospitals and the rest will be Level 3.Level-5 health facilities are known as county referral hospitals and have more than 100-bed capacities.They are run by chief executive officers who must be medical doctors.The facility should handle more than 250 patients daily and have the capacity to manage medical, paediatric, surgical and gynaecological in-patients.It should also offer renal dialysis, radiology services, tuberculosis management, mortuary and autopsy services, 24-hour pharmacy, pathology, chemotherapy and forensic services.A level 5 hospital should be built on at least 10 acres or 5,000 square metres. It should have inpatient and outpatient pharmacies, burns unit and a staff quarters for at least eight people on duty.Besides a medical superintendent, Level 5 hospitals should have at least 15 medical officers, seven anesthesiologists, two cardiologists, four general surgeons and two orthopaedic surgeons.Another requirement is that it should employ at least 90 clinical officers, 118 nurses with specialists spread across different departments, 11 pharmacists and 10 pharmaceutical technologists."
31,Bobasi residents hold demonstration over division of constituency,"Anti-riot police in Nyacheki, Kisii on Sunday dispersed demonstrators from Bobasi who want the constituency to divided into two.County Deputy Speaker David Onuso, who is also the Masige East Ward MCA was arrested by police who had erected a barrier along the road between Nyacheki and Nyangusu.Onuso had gone to plead with them to allow the demonstrations to go on when he was arrested.A few MCAs who were with him -Blansius Mature (Bassi Boitang'are Ward) and Geoffrey Ombati (Sameta Mokwerero) fled from the scene after the demonstration turned violent.Teargas canisters were lobbed into the air to disperse hundreds of protesters that had already gathered.Journalists covering the demo were also roughed up.The officers said they did not want them to cover an illegal protest.""We don't want to know if you're journalists or not, and whether you're one you cannot come here to cover something already declared illegal,"" said an officer in riot gear before he lobbed rear gas onto bodabodas and those carrying placards.Last week, Interior CS Fred Matiangi told the residents that the division of the constituency was already among the agenda being looked at the highest decision making organs.He spoke at Majimazuri Primary School."
32,Kitui veterans line up to dethrone Ngilu,"At least four Kitui politicians have announced they will seek to dethrone Governor Charity Ngilu.More than one and half years to the 2022 General Election, those salivating for the county top seat and the 474,512 votes have publicly expressed their interest in the governor seat.And now, like all good politicians, they have become regular visitors to funerals, church services and fundraisers to win hearts, souls and votes of the electorate.Like incumbent Ngilu, who is on her first term, most of those seeking to replace her are seasoned politicians and household names.They include former Kitui Governor Julius Makau Malombe, who lost to Ngilu in 2017 and ex-Senator David Musila, who abandoned the senatorial seat in 2017 to take an unsuccessful shot at the governor's seat.Like Malombe, he was trashed at the polls, coming in second. Malombe finished third.Another candidate is Julius Kiema Kilonzo, Kenya’s high commissioner to Uganda. He is a former Kitui East MP and lost his bid 2013 for the governor's seat.Former Nairobi Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke, who served under Governor Evans Kidero from 2013 to 2017, has shifted base from Nairobi and is gunning for the top job in his home county.And, although Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has not announced his intention to run, according to the grapevine, he would well be in the race.Wambua is said to be very shrewd and strategic, awaiting the best time to make his announcement.Given Malombe and Musila suffered humiliating defeats in 2017, Governor Ngilu is unlikely to suffer sleepless nights about their candidacies, which her handlers expect to be repeat losses.To Ngilu’s political advisers, Mueke’s entry into the race is not a big deal. They say he is not well-known and will have to do a lot more to sell himself  to the people and make any impact on the election equation.Senator Wambua,a former journalist, has tried to parry allegations he is interested in Ngilu's job, but he has publicly said all elective seats would be up for grabs.Some time back Ngilu alleged that Wambua was covertly undermining her administration because he wanted the seat.Wambua hit back, saying the only seat for which he would be ineligible would be that of woman representative. That was as close as he came to declaring his interest in the top county seat.Ngilu says she has effectively fulfilled her campaign pledges and five-point manifesto to the people of Kitui, despite rivals saying she has not delivered. She wants to complete the job in a second term.The pillars of Ngilu’s manifesto were ensuring enough water and food security; accessible and affordable healthcare for all, education and youth development, women empowerment and wealth creation.Late last year, Ngilu hosted Devolution CS Eugene Wamalma to commission the Kew Ndaki water project in Kitui South.During the launch, she expressed concern that some men had ganged up to remove her from office.She beseeched the electorate to protect her against the onslaught by rejecting the men and reelecting her because she has completed her part of the bargain and met her campaign pledges.Ngilu has been credited with Kitui Textile Centre, which has created jobs and played a key role in producing Covid-19 response equipment such as face masks and PPE. Last year, she launched a manmade beach on a manmade lake for boating, kayaking, jet skiing and fun in the sun. The Kalundu Eco Park in Kitui town, she said, will provide business opportunities and jobs.Among the challenges she faces is the green grams project that seems to have flopped. In October 2017, Ngilu launched what she called the Ndengu Revolution. The aim of the Sh100 million programme was to make green grams Kitui’s key cash crop to help end the cycle of hunger and create wealth for residents.But the rains were inadequate and discouraged many farmers from planting the seeds. The few who planted, got little or no yield as their crop withered prematurely.And even when there was a bumper harvest in the following season, the promised market was not available as there was a glut on the market. Ngilu also wants to exploit coal in the Mui Basin but there has been considerable local opposition; the situation remains unclear.BBI ALTERNATIVESNgilu appears, however, to be torn between seeking reelection and seeking a higher national office available, if the Building Bridges initiative referendum passes and creates an expanded Executive.Last year, she told a KTN talk show that she could seek a national seat preserved for women under BBI.However, if Ngilu seeks reelection, she will have to answer rivals who say she has not done enough to alleviate socioeconomic problems in the county.Her competitors cite water scarcity, better access to better healthcare, economic empowerment and preventing plunder of public resources meant for development.Malombe and Musila were not convinced that they lost fair and square to Ngilu in 2017. They say her performance has not been good and they are asking voters to reject her in 2022 so they can get better services.Malombe said in an interview last week that although Kitui people want him back as governor, he loathed a scenario in which Kitui was turned into an early electioneering mode long before August 2022.He said he would wait before full-out campaigning but said his development record as Ngilu's predecessor spoke for itself.Musila also cites what he calls an excellent development record when he served as Mwingi South MP for three terms and as a senator for one term.“The Kitui electorate is unhappy with the incumbent’s development record with many unfulfilled promises. The health sector is in shambles,” Musila said.He pledged to ensure balanced, countywide development and prudent spending.Youthful Mueke is banking on the support of young people to win the Kitui' governor's seat. He says it's time the voice of the youth was projected by having one of their own in the top job.“I am driven because I have have the capacity to solve the perennial water shortage and make water accessible to all. I have the experience to create jobs, especially for young people. And I know how to provide services that will better the lives of our people in Kitui,” Mueke said.Kilonzo, who served as Kitui East MP, says he is well-known across the county and could easily be elected governor.His political strategists are selling him on social media as ""the governor who is in the hearts of the Kitui people.""With such smart and experienced rivals, Ngilu has reason to worry, but too many competitors could work to her advantage by splitting the vote, leaving her the lion's share in 2022."
33,Kazi Mtaani programme extended by one more month,"The government has extended the Kazi Mtaani Programme by one more month.The PS said after the end of the programme, some of the workers will transition to other programmes carried out by other state departments and agencies, beyond March.“To all the Kazi Mtaani youth, kindly note the National Hygiene programme has been extended for another 1 month and will now come to an end on 4th, March 2021. Therefore, Cohort “A” will resume work on 3rd, February 2021,” the PS said.Hinga said he will release more information in due course.Kazi Mtaani was rolled out last April as an economic stimulus for informal settlements to mitigate the adverse effects Covid-19.The programme which started with a budget of Sh10 billion employs 280,000 youth in 900 informal settlements across the 47 counties.The work done include tree growing, access road construction, rehabilitation of public facilities, garbage collection and street cleaning.The initiative falls under the State Department for Housing and Urban Development, which was feted by VIOS during the Covid-19 Volunteers Response Recognition Awards.In October, the programme won acclaim from Volunteer Involving Organisations for its contribution to bettering the lives of youths during the Covid-19 pandemic.The World Bank also commended the Programme saying it had helped in reducing crime and drug abuse in the informal settlements.The programme, the global lender noted, has also reduced youth dependency on other people and improved livelihoods.""Cumulatively, the funds have helped spur the local economies leading to improved livelihoods for the residents of the participating informal settlements,” the WB said in a statement last October.   “The benefits accruing from this programme are essential to building the resilience of informal settlement dwellers both during the pandemic and after,” the World Bank said.The government pays the youths Sh560 million per month.Each earns Sh455 daily, while supervisors take home Sh505, according to the State Department of Housing and Urban Development."
34,Why politicians are salivating over Mt Kenya voting bloc,"With the 2022 elections on the horizon, the Mt Kenya voting bloc is attracting more political interest than ever before since the advent of multiparty democracy.The vote-rich area has turned into a battleground for outsiders seeking the presidency and for leaders from within who want to take over from President Uhuru Kenyatta as the region's kingpin.Lack of a clear successor when Uhuru retires in 2022 is seen to have triggered a high-stakes game to control a population that decisively delivered victories during the 2013 and 2017 general elections.With this in mind, politicians nursing presidential ambitions are banking on the region- Uhuru’s base- to catapult them to State House.This could be the first time since 1992 that the region will not have one of their own as a strong candidate for the presidency.And without a strong presidential hopeful, the plum prime minister's position proposed in the Constitution Amendment Bill 2020 is seen as the ultimate reward for the region in 2022.During the 2017 elections, the region had a total of 5.3 million votes, some 31 per cent of the 19.6 million registered voters.The vote bloc comprises Kiambu, Murang’a, Nyeri, Embu, Kirinyaga, Nyandarua, Laikipia, Meru and Tharaka Nithi, as well as Nakuru counties.Deputy President William Ruto, party leaders Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) have all shown keen interest in the region.Pundits observe that the region feels let down by the Jubilee administration since the residents had very high hopes when they voted in 2017.Loss of livelihoods, joblessness and poor returns from agriculture are some of the key problems residents want to be addressed.Political analyst Daniel Orogo said presidential aspirants are attracted to Mt Kenya because the region will determine who wins the elections.“The region has determined the political leadership of the country, historically. Mt Kenya has decided the presidency by either voting for or against the presidential candidates and that determines the success or the failure of the candidates,” he stated.Orogo added that region could be a swing vote in the next polls, which makes it much needed for any candidate.“While all other presidential candidates must, first of all, ensure they consolidate their own blocs, additional compact votes from Mt Kenya are additional and a springboard to ensure that one ascent to the presidency,” he said.Kariuki Ngunjiri, a political commentator, said Mt Kenya region is experiencing the scramble to win it over because of its numerical and historical advantage.“In every election since Independence the region has been a major factor, but more attractive in this one since there's likely not to be a presidential candidate,” he explained.Ngunjiri said, however, there are those scrambling for the region to scatter and divide the vote it and perhaps create an opportunity for their numbers to work.“Because once you kill the culture of Mt Kenya voting as a bloc, then there are some candidates who would rally their stronghold bases to record high voter turnouts,” he added.Deputy President Ruto has visited the region countless times and has been in touch with a cross-section of its elected leaders.He has also created a ‘hustler nation' narrative that appears to resonate with the masses in the region, resentful of elites and dynasties with their privileges.The DP seems to enjoy near-fanatical following across the region. His rallies and roadside meetings are usually well attended, more than those of any other presidential hopeful.Raila, Mudavadi and Kalonzo are proponents of the Building Bridges Initiative and have been drumming up support for the constitutional amendment as they try to win over the electorate.The ODM leader has, however, insisted that he will only talk about 2022 after the BBI referendum.Ironically, the ODM party has already invited people interested in flying its flag in 2022 to submit papers. It strongly suggests Raila will be on the ballot, even as he remains tight-lipped on the matter.Ruto, on the other hand, recently said he will focus his energy on the implementation of government projects ""because there is a lot of work to be done, I will focus on helping President Kenyatta on issues of development; others can drive the BBI agenda.""Mudavadi is positioning himself as Mt Kenya's safest pair of hands to succeed Uhuru.In August last year, he assured Uhuru's backyard that they should not worry as he has no grudges.He has built long-standing friendly ties with Mt Kenya people since he joined politics.Lately, he has also been reaching out to Mt Kenya region to popularise the BBI and his 2022 candidature.“Most businesses in Mt Kenya are being auctioned because the government has failed to manage the economy,” Mudavadi said in an interview with a Kikuyu FM station recentlyKalonzo has been also courting the region as he rallies it to support BBI. At the end of last year, he toured Laikipia and Nyeri counties. He opened a party office in Nyahururu town, Laikipia, and addressed residents at Sipii and Kinamba centres.Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura says Uhuru's promise to support Ruto in 2022 has worked in favour of the DP.“Uhuru promised at Afraha Stadium when they joined hands that ‘Ni yangu kumi na ya Ruto kumi.'He added that Raila needs to work hard since the handshake has been perceived to have a political motive to sideline Ruto, in his favour, while Uhuru comes back as prime minister."
35,Karanja Kibicho: The Tangatanga punching bag,"Dr Karanja Kibicho wasn’t known to many until the Jubilee government came to power in 2013.But since then, he has risen to be a key figure in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration, starting of as Principal Secretary at the high-ranking Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Kibicho swapped positions with Monica Juma, who was at the time at the Interior docket, when President Kenyatta reogranised government in November 2015.Since then, other than stopping his moderate drinking completely to stay alert as he told some administrators in Nyamira, Kibicho has risen to be among the most powerful figures in the Jubilee government, especially in the second termTogether with his boss, Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, they have streamlined coordination of government and often crossed lines with allies of Deputy President William Ruto.The latest case involved former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, who claimed him and Kibicho, with other individuals in the ‘deep state’, bought ODM t-shirts and second-hand cars, which they burnt on Ngong Road at the height of 2017 elections to paint the Orange party as violent.Kibicho denied the claims and recorded a statement with DCI. He also threated to sue Sonko for character assassination.This, is however, — and Kibicho noted as well — not the first time they are fighting. They have been on a warpath for more than three years.When talk of impeachment started getting louder at City Hall, Sonko claimed Kibicho was frustrating him.On October 2020, he said President Kenyatta was surrounded by the Interior duo, whom he said were misleading him and labelled them conmen .Their fight goes back to March 19, 2013 when appearing on Citizen TV, Sonko claimed Kibicho and former Gatanga MP and Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe were determined to block him from vying for Nairobi governor under the Jubilee ticket.It does not stop with Sonko.Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi has in the past said Matiang'i and PS Kibicho are working on a political scheme to undermine DP Ruto.Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has also accused a ""certaing clique of civil servants at teh Office of teh President"" or working to frustrate teh DP.Murkomen has also accused Kibicho of using his office and powers to withdraw security details attached to legislators allied to DP Ruto.Even back home in Kirinyaga, Kibicho has accusers.Last year, Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru accused him of fanning political hostility against her in the county. Waiguru said the PS was the primary catalyst of the divisive politics in Kirinyaga. This was after she spent nine hours being interrogated at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.""I learnt with consternation that ill-informed impeachment motion was carried out with your tacit support. You are the primary catalyst to my political problem,"" Waiguru said in a statement.The fight was linked to supremacy battles in the county, with speculation the PS has political ambitions. He has refuted the claims.But his defence has come from the unlikeliest of all places.When he was accused of being part of an assassination plot against DP Ruto that never was, Makadara MP George Aladwa said, “I ask leaders to desist from undermining a public officer while doing his job. The PS is an appointee of the President and his only crime can be implementing President Uhuru Kenyatta’s policy”.And who is this Kibicho?He was born of Njogu Wakibicho and Muthoni Kibicho on July 29, 1967 in Nairobi.His profile shows he is an engineer by profession, attaining Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Nairobi in 1991. Five years later, he got a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the same university.In 2006, he earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Cape Town.Kibicho began his career as an assistant factory manager at Kenya Tea Development Authority in 1992 from where took a position of lecturer at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology 1n 1993.Upon getting his doctorate he became the mechanical engineering department chairman at Jkuat in 2007, a post he held until 2010. He has also veriopusly held the position of an external examiner at the University of Dar es Salaam, visiting lecturer at the Central University of Technology in South Africa and a part-time lecturer at the University of Cape Town.He is married with three children."
36,"Tolerate, embrace divergent views for sake of peace - Ruto","Deputy President William Ruto has urged leaders to tolerate and embrace divergent views for the sake of peace and development.He said it was the responsibility of leaders to exercise tolerance for differing opinions adding that fundamental democratic principles were important to attaining long-term economic growth.Speaking in Funyula, Khwisero and Matungu Constituencies in Busia and Kakamega Counties on Saturday, Ruto said leaders should embrace tolerance to divergent views.“As leaders, we should embrace divergent views, peace and respect for each other,” Ruto said.Ruto urged Kenyans to reject politicians who want to drag the country through divisive and tribal politics.He said Kenyans are now keen on leaders focused on development agenda but not those bent on rhetoric.“It’s time, we elect leaders based on development programmes and not because of their tribes,” Ruto said.The deputy president said the country could only sustain its growth through constructive politics devoid of divisions and incitements.He said power was not about sharing positions among the elite but rather it’s about implementing policies and programmes aimed at creating wealth to be shared among the people, who are the majority.He said the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) should not be focused more on the creation of positions for few individuals but address the issues affecting ordinary citizens.“As we push for the creation of positions for few individuals at the top, we should also address the empowerment of majority of Kenyans at the bottom. This is why we want to embrace the bottom-up approach on matters of economic empowerment,” Ruto said.Present were MPs Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East), Ayub Savula (Lugari), Malulu Injendi (Malava), Caleb Kositany (Soy), former Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa and former Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale.Kositany urged Kenyans to be tolerant to divergent views, saying Kenya was a democratic country that everyone must be given the opportunity to express his or her views.MPs Injendi and Washiali urged voters in Matungu to elect a leader who was committed to addressing challenges facing them."
37,Coronavirus: WHO criticises EU over vaccine export controls,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the EU's announcement of export controls on vaccines produced within the bloc, saying such measures risked prolonging the pandemic.The EU introduced the measure amid a row with vaccine manufacturers over delivery shortfalls.But WHO vice-head Mariangela Simao said it was a ""very worrying trend"".Earlier WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said ""vaccine nationalism"" could lead to a ""protracted recovery"".Speaking at the Davos Agenda - a virtual version of the global summit - he said vaccine hoarding would ""keep the pandemic burning and... slow global economic recovery"" in addition to being a ""catastrophic moral failure"" that could further widen global inequality.What is the EU doing?The European Union is introducing export controls on coronavirus vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls.The so-called transparency mechanism gives EU countries powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them hasn't honoured existing contracts with the EU.""The protection and safety of our citizens is a priority and the challenges we now face left us with no choice but to act,"" the European Commission said.  The controls will affect some 100 countries worldwide - including the UK, the US, Canada and Australia - but many others, including poorer nations, are exempt.However the EU has been forced to backtrack on plans to impose restrictions on the export of vaccines across the border on the island of Ireland after outcry from Dublin and London.The EU insists its controls are a temporary scheme, not an export ban.Why is this happening now?The news comes with the EU in a very public dispute with drug-maker AstraZeneca over supplies, and under growing pressure over the slow pace of vaccine distribution.Earlier on Friday the Commission made public a confidential contract with AstraZeneca, the UK-Swedish company behind the Oxford vaccine, to bolster its argument that the firm has been failing to fulfil its promises to deliver to the bloc.Under the new rule, vaccine firms will have to seek permission before supplying doses beyond the EU. Its 27 member states will be able to vet those export applications.Vaccines produced by Pfizer in Belgium are currently being exported to the UK, and the EU insists that some of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in England is destined under contract for EU citizens.The EU is also in a supply dispute with Pfizer, which is set to fall short of the contracted vaccine volume for the EU by the end of March. Pfizer says the reason for that is the urgent expansion of its facility in Puurs, Belgium.AstraZeneca's shortfall to the EU is expected to be about 60% in the first quarter of 2021.As the export controls were announced, the EU medicines regulator, the EMA, gave authorisation for the AstraZeneca vaccine to be used in over-18s.Who is exempt from the export controls?The EU is allowing some 92 exemptions from the export control regime, including: vaccine donations to Covax, the global scheme to help poorer countries; and exports to Switzerland, countries in the western Balkans, Norway and North Africa. Other Mediterranean countries such as Lebanon and Israel are also exempt.Explaining the export measures, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides told a news conference they would ensure that all EU citizens had access to vaccines, and that all parties played by the rules.""This approach is built on trust, transparency and responsibility,"" she said.However the WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan said the disputes between wealthy nations over vaccines were concerning given that health workers and high-risk populations in other parts of the world faced a long wait for any vaccines at all.""It looks like fighting over the cake, when they don't even have access to the crumbs,"" he said."
38,Remove Covid measures to allow 24-hour economy flow- Thirdway Alliance,"Thirdway Alliance party is urging President Uhuru Kenyatta to rescind some of the Covid-19 containment measures which have become an obstacle to the economic recovery.The party said in a statement on Saturday that it is time to open the economy and to let Kenyans breathe and earn the sweat of their brow.It said that, “The whole nation is economically fractured and calling for the containment knee on their necks to be lifted, now, before it is too late.”“We are calling on the President to, urgently, remove this knee that is pressing hard on the throats of Kenyans. Let Kenyans breathe normally and let them do what they know best – earning an honest living free of these discriminative, impoverishing, and suffocating restrictions,” the statement reads.The party has claimed that Covid-19 containment and attendant protocols have become part of day to day living and its mortality rate can be managed.“The mortality rate of Covid-19 at 1700, as compared to that of Malaria at almost 10,000 Kenyans annually, gives us a sigh of confidence that it is containable and manageable under an even more eased environment and free economy.”Further, the party has argued that politicians continue to operate normally and in total disregard of the containment measures, yet the restrictions including a night curfew are still in place.“With the BBI and early 2022 campaigns taking a heightened political turn, we see rallies bringing thousands together without any consideration to the established protocols.”It added that the legitimate businesses must be allowed to thrive freely and like they did during the pre-Covid time.“Interestingly, bank loans and charges have also been reinstated to what they were, while other reliefs granted to the people have also been removed.”The president and his deputy William Ruto including ODM leader Raila Odinga have been at the forefront drumming up support for BBI and 2022 campaigns despite the executive order issued banning such gatherings for 60 days.Earlier this month, the president issued an executive order extending some of the containment measures.Uhuru said that all forms of public events and gatherings which may act as ‘super spreader’ events for the virus, including political and roadside gatherings/meetings, shall remain suspended for the next 60 days.The nationwide curfew will continue to be enforced between 10 pm and 4 am daily.The executive order was to ensure that the eco-system is manageable as children reopened schools."
39,112 new Covid-19 cases as two succumb to disease,"Kenya on Saturday recorded 112 new Covid-19 cases and this is from a sample size of 5,401 tested in the last 24 hours.This now brings the total number of cases in the country to 100,675, with the cumulative tests now standing at 1,183,212.From the cases, 101 are Kenyans while 11 are foreigners and gender wise, the youngest is a four-year-old while the oldest is 76 years.Recovery wise, 34 patients have recovered from the disease with 22 from the home based isolation and care while 12 are from different health facilities.Unfortunately, two patients have succumbed to the disease, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1,755.There are 481 patients currently admitted in various health facilities countrywide, while 1,370 are on hoe based isolation and care.26 patients are in ICU, 14 of whom are on ventilatory support and 12 on supplemental oxygen with 12 of them in the general wards and three in the High Dependency Unit.In terms of county distribution, Nairobi leads with 68, Uasin Gishu13, Kajiado eight, Mombasa five, Kilifi four, Busia and Kiambu with three cases each, Turkana two, while Machakos, Marsabit, Baringo, Murang'a, Nyeri and Siaya have one case each."
40,Uhuru: I owe no one anything,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has given yet another indication that he might not support his deputy William Ruto when he told a parked delegation in Sagana that he owes no one.Speaking on Saturday when he met 5000 delegates from Mt Kenya region, the President said he is only indebted to the millions of Kenyans.“Some people keep saying I made a promise to them. No, I only have a promise and covenant with the people of Kenya,” the President said.“That is the promise I am implementing. Ask your guy why he can't allow me to do my work and keeps coming back for the baton, instead of waiting for his turn.” The two leaders campaigned on a platform of Uhuru serving two terms and supporting DP for another two terms.Saturday's statement is a complete departure from his Friday’s statement when he appeared to be reinforcing his 2013 commitment of backing his deputy.On Friday, Uhuru told MCAs from the 10 counties of Central Kenya that he has never said he will not support his deputy.“I have never said I will not support William Ruto; why do you keep insulting me? Yes, I said kumi kumi, yangu kumi iliisha lini? (I said 10-10, but when did my 10 years end?).""I have been busy with work, doing what you asked me to do. The rest have been making noise.""The President has been in Sagana since Friday meeting various stakeholders as he drum support for the Building Bridges Initiative.Uhuru in another veiled attack at the DP claimed Ruto has not given him ample time to deliver and instead is concentrating more on 2022 elections.“Ask your guy why he can’t allow me to do my work and keeps coming back for the baton, instead of waiting for his turn,” he said."
41,KWS officer detained for threatening to kill girlfriend,"A Kenya Wildlife Service ranger who allegedly threatened to shoot dead his girlfriend will remain in custody after police sought a court order to detain him pending investigations. Francis Macharia, a ranger based in Malindi, was arraigned on Friday before Makadara chief magistrate Angelo Kinthinji  but he did not take a plea after police sought more days  to detain him.Police constable Morgan Mwaura attached to Mwiki police station said he was investigating a case of threatening to kill and causing a disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace among other offences.Macharia is accused of threatening to shoot dead his girlfriend Rahab Wairimu together with her child.He reportedly went to Wairimu's business and assaulted her together with her customers he accused of dating her.“After intervention by members of the public, the respondent said that he would get a gun and kill her together with her child,” Mwaura said in an affidavit filed at Makadara law courts.He said that the complainant got scared since the suspect is an officer working under KWS and thus can easily access a gun.Mwaura told the court that  Macharia was arrested but released on January 28 but he returned to Wairimu’s business premises and caused chaos again.The officer said Macharia is a threat to Wairimu and sought the court’s permission to hold him for a day. Chief magistrate Angelo Kithinji granted the orders.The matter will be mentioned on February, 1."
42,Boda boda riders reject warning from police boss,"Boda Boda riders have rejected a warning from Police Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai that putS them on notice following recent violent incidents linked to them.The riders, through the Boda boda Association of Kenya, condemned the Mutyambia notice, asking to instead engage them in constructive dialogue. There have been reports of violence, mugging, robbing and burning of vehicles in towns including Nairobi. Accident sites have, in particular, been cited as main places of such crimes where victims are robbed of their belongings and riders are accused of being the main perpetrators. There have also been complaints against the riders for acts of impunity on the roads, flouting of traffic rules and other crimes. Mutyambai on Thursday in a statement said police would would soon map out the accident hotspots and mount massive operations to restore order and smoke out the criminals. But the riders dismissed the warning, saying that a confrontational approach that condemns the riders would not work. Only constructive dialogue would, they said. The association officials rejected all the claims against their members, asserting that none of them had engaged in impunity or crime. Their members respect traffic rules, they added. The officials called on their IG to call a meeting with the association leaders and representatives of the riders to help develop regulations that should govern the sector. This will help smoke out a few of them who may be engaging in crime, they said."
43,"Anti-Mwilu court order is judicial terror and oppression, says Orengo","The court order barring Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu from acting as the Chief Justice is a judicial act of terror, Siaya Senator James Orengo has said.The High Court in Meru on Friday is barred Mwilu from acting as Chief Justice and chairing the Judicial Service Commission following a petition questioning her integrity. The petitioner alleges that Mwilu is facing corruption cases in various courts and the JSC thus unsuitable to ascend to the higher office. Mwilu has appealed all the cases before her and obtained stay orders against the DPP from prosecuting her in some cases. However, Senator Orengo on Saturday said the ruling signified that the rule of law had broken and ushered in judicial anarchy. ""The rule of law is broken and judicial anarchy sets in when judicial processes are used and abused to achieve unlawful outcomes or brazen political objectives,"" the Senate Minority leader said.""The orders obtained ex-parte against CJ Mwilu (Ag) is an egregious act of judicial terror and oppression,"" he declared.Orengo's complaint joins numerous others who have termed the ruling as outrageous and that it signified the scheme to clip the wings of the Judiciary.Law Society of Kenya president Nelson Havi, on his part, demanded that judge Patrick Otieno, who issued the order, be removed from office because of misconduct.Asserting that the order is a nullity, Havi said the lawyers involved in the petition, including petitioning advocate and his advocate, be disbarred.""The order made by Justice P J Otieno restraining DCJ and Ag CJ Philomena Mwilu from serving is a nullity ab initio (of no consequence). For good order though, it should be set aside, P J Otieno removed from office and the Petitioner Advocate and his Advocate disbarred.,"" he said in a tweet.Havi said a judge cannot bar another from acting and that a similar petition had been dismissed earlier by Justice James Mrima of the High Court in Nairobi. Other commentators have described the ruling as a coup against the Constitution and that it was perpetrated by forces whose eyes are focused on the hiring of the new Chief justice.The schemes against Mwilu, they argue, are aimed at disqualifying her from going for the job and being part of the JSC that will conduct the recruitment."
44,Kenyans to access public libraries from Monday after Covid shutdown,"Kenyans will from Monday be able to access public libraries in the country after a long time of closure due to Covid-19.The Kenya National Library Service has announced that all the 64 branches countrywide will be reopened on Monday and are set to resume normal operations.“Library customers are encouraged to follow the Covid-19 protocols provided for safe use of the facilities and resources,” the management said in a notice.The operating hours will remain between 8.00 am to 6.30 pm from Monday to Friday and 8.30 am to 5.00 pm on Saturdays.The libraries will, however, remain closed on Sundays and public holidays.“KNLS head office has relocated to Maktaba Kuu building at Community from KNLS Buruburu library premises. However, the library at Buruburu remains operational,” the management said.The new ultra-modern Maktaba Kuu building which houses KNLS headquarters was officially opened by President Uhuru Kenyatta in November last year.The President pointed out that Maktaba Kuu, which is the first multi-purpose library in Kenya, is part of his Administration’s promise to open new avenues for Kenyans to learn, obtain information, expand their intellectual horizons and promote a reading culture.“This marks an important milestone for us and for the future generations, who stand to benefit from our continued commitment to knowledge and information sharing,"" Uhuru said.Special features of the library building include a 300 capacity children theatre, a 50-capacity senior citizens section, and four auditoriums with a combined capacity of 1,200 people tailored to provide spaces for local authors and artists to showcase their work.It also has a 500-seater gallery dubbed Sanaa Centre which is available to local artists to showcase their artefacts.The new library building also has a section for persons with disabilities where books and other materials are available in different formats including Braille, audiobooks, and large print formats."
45,Why Kenya should invest in more testing for new Covid-19 variant,"Kenya will have to ramp up testing, isolation of contacts and treatment of patients, as well as enhancing proven prevention measures in the wake of the new Covid-19 variant.The World Health Organization warned that if care is not taken, the variant will fuel the country’s second wave that has been slowing down in the past weeks.The global health agency is already working to track and tackle new variants by helping countries build and boost the complex genomic surveillance capacities needed to detect and respond to new variants, shipping samples to sequencing laboratories and providing supplies and technical guidance.“Our shared goal is to get ahead of the virus. Unfortunately, the journey will be longer, harder and far more costly in the absence of consistent, all-of-society commitments to blocking infection,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti said.Moeti is the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa.The 501Y.V2 variant, first identified in South Africa, is predominant and powering record case numbers in South Africa and the sub-region.The variant has now been found in Kenya, Botswana, Ghana, Comoros, Zambia and in 24 non-African nations, the WHO has said.So far, the agency in collaboration with Africa Centres of Disease Control and Prevention has set up a Covid-19 genomic sequencing laboratory network with laboratories in several countries including Kenya.Countries without the labs will be required to ship at least 20 samples to sequencing laboratories every month to help map the fast-evolving situation and best target responses at all levels.“In addition to the new variants, Covid-19 fatigue and the aftermath of year-end gatherings risk powering a perfect storm and driving up Africa’s second wave and overwhelming health facilities,” Moeti said.“Africa is at a crossroads. We must stick to our guns and double down on the tactics we know work so well. That is mask wearing, hand washing and safe social distancing. Countless lives depend on it.”According to WHO, more than 175,000 new Covid-19 cases and more than 6,200 deaths were reported in Africa in the last week alone.Similarly, infections rose by 50 per cent on the continent between December 29 and 25 January compared with the previous four weeks."
46,"UK, US raise concern over human rights violations in Rwanda","The United Kingdom has expressed concern over “continued restrictions to civil and political rights and media freedom” in Rwanda.UK's ambassador to the EU Political and Security Committee Julian Braithwaite made the statement on Rwanda at the 37th Session of Universal Periodic Review.“As a member of the Commonwealth, and future Chair-in-Office, we urge Rwanda to model Commonwealth values of democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights,” said the statement dated January 25.But the UK welcomed Rwanda’s “strong record” on economic and social rights, and promotion of gender equality.In human rights realm, however, the UK recommended that Rwanda conducts transparent, credible and independent investigations into allegations of extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture and brings perpetrators to justice.It also called on the Paul Kagame government to protect and enable journalists to work freely, without fear of retribution, and ensure state authorities comply with the Access to Information law.Braithwaite also recommended screening, identifying and providing support to trafficking victims, including those held in government transit centres.However, Rwanda’s delegation led by Justice Minister and Attorney General Johnston Busingye denied the claims in a lengthy statement virtually.Busingye denied existence of illegal detention facilities, dismissed allegations the opposition and critical media were being deliberately targeted.He also denied the government of Rwanda is involved in forced disappearances.“There are no prosecutions that target persons simply because they are politicians or journalists or human rights defenders, and the so-called political trials do not exist, nor are trials against journalists or human rights defenders just for being journalists or human rights defenders,” the AG said.The US also said despite Rwanda’s progress in increasing gender equality and access to education, it was concerned about limited civic and political space. ""This is specifically unduly burdensome permitting requirements which inhibit the right of peaceful assembly,"" US State Department said in a statement. The US recommended promotion for the right to freedom of expression by ending detentions and harassment of members of the media and civil society for their reporting, among other proposals highlighted by  Human Rights World Report 2021 accused the Rwandan Patriotic Front of targeting those perceived as a threat to the government last year.“Several high-profile government critics were arrested or threatened. Authorities failed to conduct credible investigations into the suspicious death in police custody of well-known singer and activist Kizito Mihigo, in February,” the report said.Human Rights Watch particularly noted that arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture in official and unofficial detention facilities continued unabated.“Fair trial standards were routinely flouted in many sensitive political cases, in which security-related charges are often used to prosecute prominent government critics,” they said.State interference and intimidation have forced many civil society actors and journalists to stop working on sensitive political or human rights issues.President Kagame has in the past hit back at critics of human rights, saying their accusations are motivated by historical guilt."
47,Mudavadi calls for political tolerance ahead of 2022,"Amani National Congress boss Musalia Mudavadi has warned against political intolerance as the country nears the 2022 election.Mudavadi said the type of politics witnessed in the country this week evokes memories of 2007 when the country found itself at the International Criminal Court (ICC).“The type of politics we have started seeing where people still throw stones...I want us all to condemn such barbaric act. I was at the Koffi Annan dialogue team, we went to ICC because of dirty politics,"" Mudavadi said.He added: “Let us not allow politicians to drive any Kenyan to the grave or to injure a fellow Kenyan.”The former Presidential candidate was speaking days after goons stoned ODM leader Raila Odinga’s convoy at Githurai 45 stage on Wednesday smashing windscreen of his chase car.The opposition chief was in a BBI sensitization tour of the populous Githurai Market.The following day, Deputy President William Ruto’s rally was disrupted by pro-BBI youths at Burma Market.Mudavadi also urged Kenyans to be wary of politicians out of touch with real issues and are only interested in their selfish interests.He called on Kenyans to avoid being used by the political class and instead choose wisely their leaders ahead of the 2022 elections.Electorates - he said - should shun leaders who offer no solution to the many problems facing the common man.The Nasa co-principal said a number of politicians are out to use Kenyans as a ladder to win political seats and abandon them after elections.Mudavadi added that Kenyans need to be extra vigilant and interrogate carefully the leaders whom they want to vote to avoid a repeat of past decisions which have turned to haunt the country.He was speaking on Friday during the burial of former Nairobi Mayor John King’ori Mwangi in Kamiti, Kiambu County.Divisive politics at a time the country is headed to the referendum and 2022 elections - he said - will hurt the economy more.The economy, he noted, requires a concerted effort by all leaders to come with practical ways of reviving it to help thousands of people who lost their jobs and are struggling to make ends meet.The ANC boss also urged the vote-rich Mt Kenya region to consider a leader who will ensure their businesses thrive.“Entrepreneurs are here (in Mt. Kenya), Mt. Kenya has prime entrepreneurs. If we have political or economic instability the region is the biggest loser,” he said.“We don’t have time to experiment with our politics.”Turning around the economy – he stated – will be his first agenda if his quest to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta is successful."
48,Kenyans cannot give up on the police,"For years, Kenyans have decried the police and the horrid manner in which they continue to operate in the country.Every year, research, studies and surveys, including by government institutions, have ranked the police among the worst-performing in Kenya.For example, the National Ethics and Anti Corruption survey released by the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission in November 2019 showed the Kenya Police Service was for yet another year the most corrupt institution in the country.The report indicated that 39 per cent of instances of corruption were recorded to happen at the service. This means more than a third of all corruption in the country occurs within the police service.Another report by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights — a government agency —released in June 2020 ranked the police as the top violators of human rights in the country at 59 per cent.The study was titled “Pain and Pandemic: Unmasking the State of Human Rights in Kenya in Containment of the Covid-19 Pandemic”.The Independent Policing Oversight Authority, another state institution, reported in June 2020 that they received 87 complaints against police officers in a period of just three months.IPOA said the complaints ranged from deaths, shootings, harassment, physical assaults resulting in serious injuries, robbery, inhuman treatment and sexual assault.Two weeks ago on January 13, I spent almost the entire day at Central police station, Nairobi, after being arrested together with other activists after we attempted to read a statement to the media in solidarity with Ugandans.I saw first hand how money exchanged hands for persons to be released.I also heard from cellmates about a syndicate of officers from the same station that operates in cohorts with pickpockets around the Odeon Cinema area to rob unsuspecting Kenyans of their valuables, including phones and ladies’ handbags.The same officers also extort money from hard-working Kenyans such as touts and cart pushers who work in the vicinity.This points to a police service that is not only rogue but in dire need of reforms.Unfortunately, police reforms have over the years been resisted by those in authority, not because they think the police service is doing well but because they want to continue using it for their own selfish gains.Those in authority know that a professional, corrupt-free and people-oriented police service cannot be manipulated and misused.So they resist reforms so that the police can continue to be inefficient and rejected by the people. This situation then renders the police needful of protection from the authorities and by so doing, service remains loyal only to those in authority.It is important to note that most police officers are a committed lot, ready not only to offer Utumishi kwa Wote but also to give up their lives for the safety and security of Kenyans.However, these officers are working in a system that hampers them from delivering their best to Kenyans.At the same time, there are the few rogue officers who commit crimes and violate the rights of Kenyans with impunity. These rogue actions are then highlighted and the sum total of it becomes that the entire Police Service is rotten.This is far from the truth and is demoralising to the many officers who have dedicated their lives to serve Kenyans and security.For the sake of the majority officers who are committed to police work, Kenyans cannot give up on the police.Every Kenyan has a patriotic duty to rid the police of the rogue officers whose actions are tarnishing the image of the service.There are champions in government who have shown a commitment to police reforms.These include Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i. The champions, together with human rights groups such as the Police Reforms Working Group must work together to force through police reforms.More importantly, Kenyans, you and me, must continue to demand accountability in the police service. It is also by us working together can we achieve a world-class police service. Polisi bora, haki yetu."
49,"Joho seeks Nyanza, Western support for presidency","Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has said the time has come for people in ODM strongholds to return his favour and support him for the presidency.Joho has expressed interest in vying for the top job at State House and will battle it out with his Kakamega counterpart Wycliffe Oparanya, and, as widely believed, ODM leader Raila Odinga, to be ODM’s flag bearer in the presidential race.On Thursday, Joho said he will prove doubting Thomases wrong in 2022, after having done so in 2007 when he first became Kisauni MP, and in 2013 and 2017 when he was elected governor.However, he said he will need support from ‘the brothers he has supported for long’.“I have supported ODM and Raila for long...It is time for you to support us now,"" said Joho.He spoke at Uwanja wa Mbuzi where he issued 2,979 title deeds to families in informal settlements and settlement schemes across the county.Joho said the Coast region has been a loyal supporter of ODM, which has dominated the region for over a decade.He noted time has come for the region to also produce a president, adding there is no better candidate than himself.He said time has come for the region, which houses minority communities, to have the national cake.“We have supported our brothers for long. Now it is time for them to support us,” Joho said.Jomvu MP Badi Twalib said Joho is the undisputed Coast political kingpin and that he is the best chance the Coast region has of producing a president.He said just as Raila has the support of the Nyanza region and Deputy President William Ruto has the support of Rift Valley region, Joho must get the support of Coast region to propel him to State House.“In Coast, we look at Joho with our two eyes,” Twalib said.He noted the Msambweni defeat of ODM was an isolated case and that one cannot always win, which he said is only human.He said the defeat did not demean Joho in any way.He said leaders must have the support of their people both in high and on low moments.“We will and we must support Joho at all times,” he said.He said a leader who unites people is a true leader who must be supported.He said Joho has started a unity campaign at the Coast starting with Garsen in Tana River county.“That is a sign of a good leader,” said Twalib.Likoni MP Mishi Mboko said all Coast leaders must support Joho.She said Joho has climbed the steps slowly in his political career and is now on the 10th floor, just about to reach the presidency on the 11th floor.""We can't reach the 10th floor then come back to the first floor,"" said Mboko.She was referring to speculation that Joho would run for a parliamentary seat, presumed to be Nyali, so as to meet the requirement for one to be appointed a Deputy Prime Minister.It was widely speculated that Joho was eying the DPM position after completing his constitutionally allowed two terms as governor in 2022.This, however, was dependent on the BBI passing in the upcoming referendum.""Once he becomes president, the biggest beneficiaries will be Mombasa and Coast residents,"" he said, his sentiments echoed by Mboko.Mboko said the Coast now has its eyes on the national cake.""Our eye is Ali Hassan Joho,"" she said.The Mombasa governor said the presidency is not a seat set aside for certain people only.He said the time has come for leaders from the minority communities to lead the country.He, however, said there are, unfortunately, those from Mombasa and the Coast region who still doubt him insisting that they will not discourage him.In fact, he noted, they give him the fuel to move forward.""If you cannot (be president) that is you. I will be in the presidential ballot,"" he declared.He said he has the ability to mount a countrywide political battle with anyone.He called on Coast residents to remove the mentality that Mombasa, Coast or minority communities cannot produce a president.""We have supported our brothers for long. Now it is time for them to support us because we can do it,"" said Joho.He said his presidency will send a message that Kenya is an equal opportunity country where equity is highly regarded.""We want a Kenya where all people have the same rights,"" said Joho.He also hit out at the supporters of the 'Hustler Nation' movement saying they are polarising the country.A good leader, Joho said, should be able to unite the country, not divide it, warning Kenyans not to allow themselves to be radicalized.""Don't divide the country into two classes - the poor and the rich,"" he said.He said a leader must be a symbol of unity not a symbol of division.""If you can't unite people you have no business leading the country,"" Joho said.He said organizing rowdy youth to disrupt rival politicians’ meetings is archaic and has no place in the modern-day.“Don’t think you are the only one who has followers. Every leader has followers, no matter how small,” said Joho.Mboko said those blaming Raila for their failures are only seeking a hiding place.She said Raila is not in government and therefore cannot be blamed for the government failures.""If it was blundering you did, carry your own cross. Don't blame Raila for your failures,"" she said in a message believed to be directed at Ruto and his allies.She said Ruto allies are spreading all kinds of propaganda against BBI because they are hiding from the truth.""Those who oppose (the BBI) are those used to strangling. They can't manage those to be knifed,"" said Mboko.She said Joho is the only Coast leader capable of leading the region on the national platform."
50,Raila convenes Kisumu BBI summit days after Uhuru's Sagana meeting,"President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga have retreated to their backyard to drum support for Building Bridges Initiative days after it got the green light from the electoral body.The ODM leader is planning a major meeting with stakeholders from the four Luo Nyanza Counties on February 8 where BBI will be the main agenda on the table.Raila’s meeting comes almost one week President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Sagana meet to rally the 'reluctant' Central behind the proposed constitutional amendments.Uhuru has been in Central Kenya since Friday in what State House said is inspection tour of government projects and meeting with elected leaders from the region to discuss among others the BBI.In Kisumu, Raila will be meeting all Governors, MPs, Professionals and Members of the four County Assemblies of Migori, Homabay, Kisumu and Siaya.The meeting will also bring on board representative of Kisumu business community and Luo Council of Elders.Already invitation has been sent to almost 800 participants to the Nyanza regional Consultative meeting.According to the letter dated January 29, each of the four counties will be represented by 200 delegates.“You are hereby notified of a consultative meeting bringing together elected leaders, Council of Elders, professionals and Business people in the four counties specified above to be held on Monday, February 8, 2021, to be chaired by Party Leader Raila Odinga,” read part of the letter signed by ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna.He added: “It is expected that each County delegation shall consist of not more than 200 people. The office of the Host Governor, Hon Peter Anyang’ Nyong’o shall be in contact with each county delegation through the respective Governor to provide further details on the meeting.”On Tuesday next week, Raila will be hosting all ODM MCAs across the country in Nairobi to a BBI meeting.There have been calls to the Assemblies to pass the BBI in record time and the two principals are in a push to have the MCAs approve the same at the earliest opportunity.During the Sagana meeting, 10 county assemblies from Central Kenya vowed to pass the referendum Bill.Kisumu Assembly has cut short its long recess and will resume sittings next week to deliberate on the Bill.Sifuna confirmed the Tuesday meeting saying invitation had already been sent to all MCAs elected on ODM ticket in the 47 counties.“Next week I have invited all my 56o MCAs to talk about the Building Bridges Initiative. They will meet experts who will take them through the documents,” Sifuna said on phone.The meeting will also deliberate on the party’s way forward including the pending harmonization of the vacant seats set to begin soon."
51,Kisumu's Shivling Supermarket razed in morning inferno,"Firefighters are currently battling to control a fire that engulfed Shivling Supermarket Limited in Kisumu City that started early Saturday morning.The cause of the fire still remains unknown.It is said the fire started at about 6.30 am when the security guards manning the premise noticed smoke coming from the supermarket.The retail outlet is located at Reinsurance Plaza on Oginga Odinga Street.A staffer at the supermarket said efforts to contain the fire when it started was a challenge because the doors were still closed.Goods worth millions of shillings are said to have been consumed in the inferno according to preliminary reports from the supermarket management.It is the second outlet in Kisumu city after moving into space formerly occupied by Choppies Supermarket at Reinsurance Plaza.The store’s first outlet located in Kondele on the Kisumu-Kakamega Road was opened on March 25, 2020.Chain director Rajesh Patel said customers had accepted them in the Kisumu market.He hinted at plans to expand to wholesale and more stores in the county and create more jobs.He said Kisumu was good for doing business following the existing peace.“We look forward to having the relative calm beyond the handshake,” Patel said.Retailer’s operations manager Sammy Wawire said they are focusing on satisfying the needs of clients.He said the branches are in line with their strategic growth in the next five years.“We have realised that the market is vibrant as there is peace and tranquillity in Kisumu,” Wawire said, urging residents to take advantage of the outlets to increase their income.Shivling is 20 years old. It has branches in Migori, Homa Bay, Kericho, Kisii, Nyamira and Kisumu.Wawire said they hope to get into the market and take advantage of the positions left after Choppies’ exit.He said despite financial constraints due to Covid-19 and slow economic growth, the retailer has seen it necessary to invest as per its expansion plans."
52,Why Mwilu could be knocked out in Maraga succession,"Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mbete Mwilu has been dealt a staggering blow in a landmark ruling that could potentially knock her out from the David Maraga succession battle.In a single ruling, the High Court made four decisions against Mwilu, effectively suspending her as Deputy Chief Justice, Judge of the Supreme Court, a member of the Judicial Service Commission and Ombudsman of the Judiciary.This also means that Mwilu will cease to act as CJ and chairperson of the JSC, twin powerful roles she took over following Maraga’s retirement a fortnight ago.“A conservatory order be and hereby issued against the 1st respondent [Mwilu] restraining her continued occupation of the Deputy Chief Justice of the Republic of Kenya, Judge of the Supreme Court of Kenya, member of Judicial Service Commission and ombudsman of the Judiciary pending the hearing and determination of the Application,” Justice Patrick Jeremy Otieno ruled on Friday.The decision to bar the DCJ from sitting in the JSC stops her from participating in the process of selecting the next CJ to succeed Maraga, which is expected to begin after applications close on February 10.Sources said Supreme Court Judge Mohamed Ibrahim who is the senior most Judge at the apex court is tipped to take over as the new acting CJ.Mwilu who has been acting as President of the Supreme Court was seen to be in pole position to succeed Maraga.The conservatory order issued in Meru was made following an application by one Isaiah Mbiti who cited four abuse of office charges pending against Mwilu at the JSC.In court, Mbiti argued that Mwilu’s continued performance of any constitutional duties while facing graft allegation reeks of favoritism and offends the tenure, ideals and spirit of Chapter Six of the Constitution.“She ought not to then enjoy preferential treatment because she is a Judge. The standard applicable to Mwilu in as far as Chapter Six of the Constitution is concerned is the standard applicable to all Kenyans. To this end, Chapter Six of the Constitution considers integrity beyond the extra-legal context into the realms of public perception, respect and honour,” he statedHe termed absurd, Mwilu’s continued stay as a member of the JSC, hearing and determining complaints against other Judges when she also has pending petitions against her.“Similarly, it is unethical, absurd and drudgery to Chapter Six of the Constitution for Mwilu to continue sitting as the Judiciary’s ombudsman in light of the complaint against her pending before the JSC,” he statedHis lawyer,  Marius Maranya made reference to Justice Mumbi Ngungi’s ruling that has compelled governors facing graft prosecution to step aside from office.“The institution of the Judiciary cannot be seen to apply different standards of integrity for judicial officers such as the 1st Respondent [Mwilu],” they argued.“The standard of moral and ethical probity required of Mwilu is that required of a constitutional office holder in respect of whom a criminal prosecution has been commenced. This standard requires that a constitutional office holder the subject of a criminal prosecution is either suspended or steps aside and does not discharge the function of the constitution office until the criminal prosecution is concluded,” they addedMwilu has four pending petitions against her at the JSC, including one filed by the DPP and the DCI.In 2018, DPP Noordin Haji moved to court to charge Mwilu for abuse of office, obtaining security by false pretense, failure to pay tax and forgery.However,  a five-judge bench terminated her prosecution saying charging her with abuse of office and forgery counts violated judicial independence, and that evidence in another five counts had been illegally obtained.It was after the court battle that the case was referred to the JSC.However there have been many intrigues at the JSC with Mwilu alleging that the executive was determined to kick her out because of her role in the nullification of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s election in 2017.Mwilu has publicly accused two JSC commissioners - Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and LSK representative Macharia Njeru - of being the architects of her woes.She said there is a scheme by her detractors to not only block her ascension but also to kick her out of the Supreme Court.Mwilu said the AG had been arranging meetings with other commissioners to discuss how to remove her from office.""I am aware of three such meetings separately attended by influential state operatives, who implored certain commissioners to fast-track the process of my removal from office,"" the DCJ claimed in court papers.Remaining JSC members who will recruit the country’s next CJ include  judges Mohammed Warsame and David Majanja, Attorney General Paul Kihara, Prof Olive Mugenda, Macharia Njeru, Felix Kiptarus and Everlyn OlwandeLSK is yet to elect a new representative replace Mercy Deche.The JSC will also recruit two Supreme Court Judges to replace Jackton Ojwang and Philip Tunoi who have since retired from the seven-member bench."
53,Sonkoleaks: Is this a case of Samsonic suicide or whistleblower?,"“Let me die with the Philistines!” These were the last words spoken by Samson, who was one of the judges who ruled over Israel before the time of kings.Samson was a Nazarite, who God had gifted with incredible strength. Yet he broke many rules of the Nazarite vows, including loving a Philistine woman called Delilah.The Philistines used this love affair to their advantage and bribed Delilah to entrap Samson to divulge the secret to his strength so that they could defeat him. He gave in to Delilah’s incessant curiosity and leaked his secret.The Philistines cut off his hair as he slept, draining him of all his strength. They then captured him, gouged his eyes out and put him to work grinding at the mill in the prison. Meanwhile, his hair started growing back.One day in one of their sacrificial rituals, the Philistines brought Samson out of the prison and made him stand between two pillars to entertain them.Samson braced himself with each hand against each pillar, and pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it.Thus, he killed many more when he died than while he lived. The leaking of his secret caused his death and that of five kings and more than 3,000 people. This has since been known as the Samsonic suicide.This week, a secret was leaked by ex-Nairobi governor Mike Sonko during a rally in Dagoretti South.He disclosed that in 2017, himself, Interior PS Karanja Kibicho, and the State machinery aka ‘system’ printed ODM party t-shirts, bought second-hand cars and burnt them on Ngong Road to make it appear that opposition supporters were violent and responsible for the destruction of private property.Kibicho and Sonko have since recorded statements with the DCI and defamation suits have been threatened by both parties.This is not the first time Sonko is leaking information to the public.He is known to notoriously reveal private information of the deceased and mourners in funerals, and to leak recorded phone conversations with prominent personalities on social media.As a rule of thumb, governments withhold information from the public and this is not likely to ever change.They do so to protect their power and do things we will never know, ostensibly in exchange for keeping us safe and acting in a way that preserves our shared values while advancing our interests and national security. Hence national secrets are legion.Accordingly, the public seeks and itches to learn that information, either directly through legal provisions such as the Access to Information Act, or indirectly through sensationalised newspaper stories, or through loose cannons like Sonko.Few people dispute that certain secrets are necessary to maintain national security, peace and national cohesion, but not all secrets serve this purpose.The line separating the two is hard to define, and what’s more difficult to determine, is who gets to draw that line.But eventually, all secrets leak. They develop a motive force of their own, particularly when it is in one of the insider’s interest to let it out. There are good and bad leaks, based on why the secret bearer lets them out.Whistleblowing is generally considered to be a good leak because it is a way to expose illegal of self-evident unethical, immoral or illegal activities.But this is often at the risk of the whistleblower’s career or livelihood. Bad leaks on the other hand are often done for some kind of gain, for revenge, to impress the populace or for political mileage.They give the enemy the playbook, and whether accurate or not, they provide leverage to manipulate the information for use against the secret bearers.They say timing is everything in politics. And this may be what we witnessed with Sonko. It is clear to all and sundry that after his impeachment, Sonko has become very indignant.Like Samson, he feels betrayed by those he trusted and did unorthodox acts for, to ensure they remain in power. Through the revelation in Dagoretti South, he implicated himself and threatened to table all evidence to substantiate his claims.Begs the question, is Sonko on a Samsonic suicide mission? Did he spill the beans because he is a whistleblower, or was he cutting off his nose to spite his face? And how much damage will he need to do before the secret bearers say enough is enough?I submit that Sonko’s buffoonery is a façade. You do not garner close to a million votes simply because of your theatrics. Beneath that façade is a very shrewd politician who knows how to read the times and the masses. And anyone that dismisses him as a mere clown, does so at his own peril.Sonko is aware of the disaffection many Kenyans are presently having with the state and particularly with the handshake duo and their BBI product.And he has no qualms about adding insult to injury by driving that wedge further even though it means incriminating himself in the process.But what he is more alive to is that the power and attraction of a secret lie in the possibility that it may be disclosed, either as a favour to the uninformed who seek to learn it or as a betrayal of the secret bearers. And more importantly that secrets give power to those who know them.Undoubtedly, in days past, Sonko has been part of the system and hence is privy to some unsavoury activities.Like Samson, he is willing to brace himself between the two pillars of very bad and even worse state secrets and bring the whole house down. Who will blink first? Is Sonko inaudibly saying “Let me die with the system?”Finally, my unsolicited advice is to the secret bearers. If you cut out a man’s tongue, you don’t prove that he is a liar. You only prove that you are afraid of what he might say.Beware of little expenses. A small leak will sink a great ship – Benjamin Franklin"
54,"Go where?: Joho, Junet clash over ODM presidential ticket","The Orange party recently announced it was starting the process to identify its presidential candidate for the 2022 presidential election.The party's National Election Board was tasked with running an advertisement in local dailies to invite applications from interested candidates.The advert urged ODM members interested in the presidency to send their applications to NEB and pay a Sh1 million non-refundable fee to ODM's account.Among other requirements is that a person must be a Kenyan, registered voter, a life member of ODM, and hold a degree from any university recognised in Kenya.ODM party deputy leader Hassan Joho is among the members who have openly said that they are ready to contest for the ticket.Joho, who is serving his second term as Mombasa County Governor, said he has been a loyal member of the party and has fought for party leader Raila Odinga on many occasions, hence is a suitable candidate for the ticket.But Joho’s remarks did not go well with Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, the party’s Director of Elections.“Go where”, the Suna East MP asked Joho, adding that they will meet on the ballot.Through his Twitter account, Joho responded; “My friend where else did you expect us to meet if not the ballot?”The spat continued as Junet challenged Joho to table the requirements before being cleared.“Governor, they say when a hyena wants to eat its children, it first accuses them of smelling like goats…weka kadi zote juu ya meza (place your cards on the table),” Junet said.This comes as pressure continues to mount up in the Coastal Region to form their political party, where ODM has reaped for many years.Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi is among the leaders from the region who have openly declared that the Coast region must settle on its own political party by June this year.“The people in the region are tired of being treated like second-class citizens during every poll and we demand to be recognised as we have more than 1.7 million registered voters,” Kingi said.Other leaders allied to the Deputy President William Ruto have drummed up support for the regional party, claiming that they have been enslaved by other parties for years."
55,Suspect in custody over death of eight-year-old son - DCI,"A man suspected to have murdered his eight-year-old son by pouring boiling water on him, is in custody following his arrest on Thursday by detectives based at Sigor, West Pokot County, DCI has reported.In a tweet posted on Friday, DCI stated that Madangure Chelonges, was reported to have savagely dealt with the boy over an unestablished issue on January 17, where the latter later succumbed to the severe burns at a local hospital. ""As further investigations continue, the suspect remains in custody pending arraignment,"" DCI said.Last week, a man was arrested for repeatedly defiling his 13-year old daughter before impregnating her.The 35-year old was arrested by detectives in Murang'a county.DCI Director George Kinoti said after noticing the condition of the class five pupil, the head teacher took the child to a local hospital, where she was confirmed to be six months pregnant.""Inquiry into the odious situation revealed that the father was responsible,"" Kinoti said.The girl narrated to the detectives that the man had been defiling her severally since July 2020.This was the period in which schools were closed due to coronavirus."
56,Pro-BBI governors sweep top CoG positions,"Governors friendly to the Building Bridges Initiative process grabbed top positions during the Council of Governors elections on Friday.Embu county boss Martin Wambora was elected - through a consensus – the chair of the council. He replaces Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who served two terms.Kisii Governor James Ongwae was picked the vice chair while Elgeyo Marakwet county chief Alex Tolgos was elected whip.Wambora, Ongwae and Tolgos are ardent supporters of the constitution amendment drive being spearheaded by President Uhuru Kenyatta.The majority of the new committee chairs are proponents of the Constitution Amendment Bill, 2020, which is before county assemblies awaiting debate.Governors Anyang' Nyong'o (Kisumu), Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga) and Kiraitu Murungi (Meru) were elected chairs of Health, Trade, Gender, Legal committees respectively.Others were governors Kahiga Mutahi (Nyeri), Wilber Ottichilo (Vihiga), Ali Korane (Garissa) and Lee Kinyanjui of Nakuru. They were elected to serve as Education, Climate, Intergovernmental, Housing committee chairs respectively.In their maiden speeches Wambora, Ongwae and Tolgos pledged to drum up support for the BBI, saying it would entrench devolution.“We cannot turn a blind eye on the BBI. We shall promote it as we continue with our duties as governors,” Wambora said.There were reports that President Kenyatta would throw his weight behind a governor who supports the BBI process to succeed Oparanya.The CoG chairmanship is a powerful post that serves as a link between the county governments and the National ExecutiveThe head of state has enjoyed a good working relationship with Oparanya during the latter's tenure. Their camaraderie blossomed further with their BBI agitation.Wambora pledged to push for timely disbursement of funds from the National Treasury to counties.He also promised to work closely with investigative agencies to fight corruption in devolved units.“I’m going to collaborate with investigative agencies and other stakeholders to eliminate graft,” he said."
57,MCAs from 10 counties promise Uhuru they'll pass BBI bill,"Ward representatives from 10 counties on Friday assured President Uhuru Kenyatta that they will pass the Building Bridges Initiative legislation within the required legal timeline.The assurance by Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Embu, Kirinyaga, Nyeri, Murang'a, Nyandarua, Kiambu, Laikipia and Nakuru MCAs was made on Friday at Sagana State Lodge in Nyeri County.This was during a meeting between the President Uhuru and 550 MCAs and their respective leadership teams.Led by their County Assembly Speakers and House Leaders, the MCAs said they back the BBI process because it will allocate more development resources to the grassroots and help solve challenges facing wananchi such as inadequate bursaries.The head of state thanked the county legislators for endorsing the BBI process saying the reforms will strengthen devolution thereby accelerating Kenya's socioeconomic transformation.He said contrary to the misleading narrative propagated few selfish individuals opposed to BBI, the reforms will help unite the country by ensuring equality and fairness in the distribution of national resources.Uhuru observed that the current national resource sharing architecture works against populous regions noting that BBI seeks to rectify the imbalance.He questioned the motive of those opposed to equal allocation of national resources to all parts of the country and cautioned Kenyans against politics of deceit perfected by some leaders.“It is our responsibility as leaders to ensure we do justice and not to threaten or insult others. We need to ensure justice and development for those who elected us,” the president said, adding that his biggest wish for Kenya is unity and progress.“What I never want to see in our country is bloodshed because of politics and leadership. Since I would never want to see incidents that occurred in 2007, I said it’s better I humble myself for our citizens to live in peace,”Uhuru rallied the county leaders."
58,141 new cases of Covid-19 as 64 recover,"Kenya on Friday recorded 141 new Covid-19 cases from a sample size of 5,644 tested in the last 24 hours.This now brings the total number of cases in the country to 100,563, with the cumulative tests at 1,177,811.From these cases, 124 are Kenyans, while 17 foreigners and as for the gender, 71 are females while 10 are males.Age wise, the youngest is a two-month-old infant while oldest is 100 years old.In terms of recoveries, 64 patients have recovered, with 44 from home based isolation and care and 20 from various health facilities.This now brings the total to 83,821.No deaths have been recorded, with the number of fatalities remaining at 1,753.There are 477 patients currently admitted in various health facilities countrywide, while 1,368 are on home based isolation and care.27 patients are in ICU, 14 of whom are on ventiltory support and 13 on supplemental oxygen.Another 16 patients are separately on supplementary oxygen with 11 of them in the general wards.Five patients are in the High Dependency Unit.Distribution of the cases by counties is as follows; Nairobi 81, Kilifi 14, Kiambu, Kajiado and Siaya with six cases each, Kisumu five, Uasin Gishu four, while Mombasa, Lamu and Nakuru have three cases each.Busia, Garissa and Bungoma have two cases each while Machakos, Nyamira, Kirinyaga and Turkana have one case each."
59,"Somalia dismisses IGAD report, says it will move to AU in row with Kenya","The government of Somalia has yet again dismissed the findings of IGAD which dismissed its allegations against Kenya as baseless.In a statement, Somalia said it reserves the right to seek redress through diplomatic means via the African Union and if necessary, the United Nations Security Council.“The federal government of Somalia will continue to exercise considerable restraint, call on IGAD to rescind this frivolous report, and to commission a multinational fact-finding mission.”Somalia claimed that the government of Kenya fabricated the IGAD report, in order to absolve itself from the illegal actions it has undertaken to undermine her  sovereignty .“The federal government of Somalia further condemns the government of Kenya’s direct interferences in the fact-finding mission report in order to absolve itself from the illegal actions it has undertaken undermining the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of the federal republic of Somalia,” the statement says.According to Somalia, the report has undeniably damaged and undermined Djibouti's impartiality and status as an entrusted partner in the region.It has also claimed that the militia along the border fighting with its military and terrorising its civilians have been supported and sponsored by the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF).The government of Kenya has however dismissed the allegations from Somalia, saying that it will not be involved in its internal skirmishes.During the press address on Thursday, Kenyan Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said Somalia should desist from dragging Kenya into its domestic issues.Oguna said the events being witnessed around Mandera have their genesis in domestic political activities in Somalia.""Allegations by Somalia that Kenya is sponsoring and harbouring militia with the objective of destabilising Somalia are not based on any merit,” Oguna said.But Somalia has continued to allege that the Kenyan troops in Somalia have supported instability and are equally  instigating insecurity by aiding militia.“Somalia has lost its confidence in the KDF’s ability to support the effort to stabilise and bring about long-term peace and security given the overt manner that the government of Kenya has sought to exploit its presence in the country as a pretext to further its national interests.”Somalia claimed that on January 25, the very militia supported by the KDF with mortar rounds, attacked Balad Hawo, resulting in the death of 14 civilians, including women and five children, from the same family. “This wanton disregard for international norms by the Republic of Kenya followed shortly after the fact-finding mission deliberately chose to limit its visit to Somalia and renege on the agreement to meet with ministers and visit Balad Hawo.

61,"Three jumbos die in Taita Taveta, says KWS","Three elephants have died in Sagala area of Taita Taveta county, the Kenya Wildlife Service said on Friday. They died on different dates.""All the deceased jumbos had their tusks intact, implying the deaths were not as a result of attempted poaching,"" KWS said in a statement.The Sagala area is a human-wildlife conflict hotspot, and initial indications point to a possible case of retaliatory poisoning.The suspects are yet to identified.""Investigations are however underway to establish the actual cause of the deaths and to bring perpetrators to book,"" KWS said.The agency appealed to the communities living adjacent to the parks and reserves not to take the law into their hands. They were urged to report any cases through toll-free number 0800597000.In 2019, authorities announced that poaching had been reduced following the introduction of tough wildlife laws.KWS director-general John Waweru said the country has also put in place various strategies that have seen poaching of wildlife sharply decline.""The application of strong and deterrent prison sentences has worked well to reduce poaching in the country. Nonetheless, illegal trafficking of ivory, rhino horn, pangolin scales, among others, still persists through various sea and airports,"" Waweru said.Thirty rhinos were poached in 2012. The figure was 59 in 2013 and 35 in 2014.Only 11 were poached in 2015 and 10 in 2016. Comparative numbers for 2017 and 2018 were nine and four respectively.The number of elephants killed in 2018 was 38.A KWS report shows an 85 per cent reduction of rhino poaching in 2017 compared to 2013 when poaching was at its peak.In 2012, 384 elephants were poached. The number reduced to 302 in 2013. The decline continued in 2014 to 164 and 96 in 2015.Some 86 elephants were poached in 2016 and 80 in 2017."
62,Delayed referendum law spells trouble for BBI - ELOG,"Poll experts have warned of a looming crisis in the wake of no solid law to define timelines for MCAs to dispense of the BBI bill.Election Observation Group cited the lack of clear public participation provision in the bill process.The team further cited the lack of unclear timelines on the submission of the respective county assembly decisions on the bill.“A clear referendum law will go a long way in addressing these concerns,” Elog said on Friday in a statement to the press.Two bills to guide the awaited referendum, and critical to defining the timelines, are yet to be legislated by Parliament.National Assembly’s Justice Committee and that on Constitutional Implementation Oversight have harmonized the two bills but the same is yet to be adopted by Parliament.ELOG said the gap in law accosted the Ekuru Aukot’s Punguza Mizigo Initiative county debate process.“Noting that there are critical legal gaps in guiding the referendum process, we urge the National Assembly to fast-track the processing into law of the two referendum bills already on the floor of the house.”“We have also recommended that the two bills be harmonized to enhance clarity and coherence to the process,” ELOG said.The poll observers want early campaigns stopped saying they are illegal, considering the IEBC is yet to issue a notice of a referendum on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.The team said early campaigns was the cause of the rising political temperatures and intolerance witnessed lately in the country.“The public need to know that our election laws have clear provisions on when campaigns can be conducted either for referendum or general elections.”ELOG has asked the police to probe the incident where youths attempted to disrupt ODM leader Raila Odinga’s rally in Githurai with a view to arresting the perpetrators.“We request the relevant authorities to take action against those found violating the law.”“We also request the DCI and police to conduct speedy investigations and apprehend those behind the spate of violence that is threatening to get out of hand,” ELOG said."
63,Elog lauds IEBC after BBI signature verification,"Election Observer Group has lauded the manner in which IEBC handled the BBI signature verification, saying it incorporated a recommendation to publicly publish the verified signatures.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission said it had verified 1,140,845 signatures.In a statement on Friday, Elog said IEBC was free to initiate the next phase of the process since the constitutional requirement was met.The group said that in the future, the commission still needs to find a way of verifying the support of popular initiatives since they do not have a repository of voter signatures.“However, we acknowledge the fact that this time around the commission published the list of processed records for confirmation by those who had signed the petition. This is in line with the recommendation that Elog made after the Punguza Mizigo signature verification process,” Elog said.The observer group expressed optimism that such a move will build confidence and enhances transparency in the process.It also said that there were no critical incidents reported during the observation period and that the Covid-19 measures were adhered to.The group has asked IEBC to fast track the initiation of a countrywide voter education campaign as the constitutional amendment process through BBI moves to the counties where public participation will be required.It said the copies of the draft constitutional amendment bill should be made available to the public.At the same time, the group said it had noted with concern the rising political temperatures and intolerance.“The violence witnessed this week in Githurai during a BBI campaign rally is strikingly similar to an earlier one where two people were killed in Kenol, Murang'a during a political rally. The NCIC and other stakeholders have gone on to warn politicians against inciting their followers.”Elog asked politicians to remember that early campaigns were illegal and should therefore be stopped."

When such an incident happens, report to the nearest police station or security office,"" he said.He directed police to be on the lookout and take necessary measures against any rider found to be taking the law into their own hands.""The police will map out the hot spots where such incidents have or are likely to occur and undertake a major operation to address the problem,"" he said.Mbadi said not all riders were boda boda operators. He said there are those who buy motorcycles for criminal activities.""There should not be blanket condemnation on all the over 1.2 million riders,"" he said.Mbadi said his organisation will work with the police to restore order in the sector.He said boda boda riders are sometimes not given justice whenever they approach police officers.The Federation of Boda Boda Association echoed Mbadi's sentiments.Chairman Kimani Wa Nduthi in a statement said his association strongly condemns the few bad elements in the sector.""We strongly condemn the few bad elements within the boda boda sector who are engaging in unlawful activities, causing harm to others and the destruction of property,"" Kimani said.He said such people are criminals who should face the full force of the law.He thanked the honest hardworking and law-abiding riders in the country and encouraged them to continue maintaining law and order."
65,Big win for Kidero in Sh58 million graft case,"Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has pulled a win after the High Court agreed with his application that the trial court unfairly dismissed issues he had raised after the prosecution amended the charge sheet in his Sh58 million graft case.Justice James Wakiaga said trial courts should be slow in advising or making suggestions to the prosecution so as to be seen to be a neutral arbitrator in disputes taken to court. Kidero had filed for a review challenging orders by chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti requiring the Director of Public Prosecutions to present and prepare new charge sheets against the former governor and his co-accused persons. Ogoti had on December 4, 2019 issued a ruling directing the prosecution to amend the charges facing Kidero and others in the Sh58 million corruption case. The prosecution subsequently presented before court a fresh charge sheet which amended the period of the alleged commission of the offence among others.  But Kidero and his co-accused declined to plead to the charges and instead raised several objections. One of them was that the prosecution had amended the period of the charge sheet through the backdoor. Kidero said the trial court did not determine the question of the defective charges but dismissed it on the basis that it was incompetent. On Friday, Wakiaga said the issues raised by Kidero were new and had not been dealt with in another application by Justice Mumbi Ngugi as earlier claimed by the prosecution.He said Ogoti failed to accord them right to fair hearing when he dismissed the issues on the charges being defective without giving satisfactory reasons. “My understanding of Kidero's complaint was that the trial court casually dismissed their objections without giving reasons but only ruling that it was “incompetent and annoying and deserves to be dismissed”, Wakiaga said.The issues raised by Kidero which required the courts determination touched on whether the fresh charge sheet was amended or substituted and whether it was defective among other things. Wakiaga said whereas the trial court had the right to dismiss those issues as raised by Kidero, they were still entitled to be given reasons for such a decision.“A judicial officer is under a general duty to provide reasons for his or her decision, to allow all the parties to see the extent to which their arguments had been understood and accepted or rejected by the court.”He said the court did not take into account the specific fresh issues raised by Kidero, neither did the magistrate give reason for rejecting or dismissing their objections.“The trials court finding that the objection raised by Kidero was ‘incompetent’ and ‘vexatious’ was improper and did not ensure the fair administration of justice as required under the Constitution,” Wakiaga said.The High Court said issues raised by Kidero were not properly handled by the trial court and that the reasons given for dismissing the same were inadequate. Wakiaga overturned the decision and sent the file back to the trial court to make a determination on all the issues raised by Kidero. “This being a revision application, the only logical conclusion is to remit the matter to the trial court, for fresh consideration and further proceedings taking into account the issues raised in the objection,” he said. Kidero was charged alongside former chief of staff George Wainaina Njogu, former Nairobi mayor John Ndirangu Kariuki and former councillor Paul Mutunga Mutungi for conspiring to defraud City Hall of Sh58 million in 2014.  Edited by P.O"
66,Uhuru arrives at Sagana State Lodge for four-day Mt Kenya visit,"President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday arrived at Sagana State Lodge in Nyeri county for a four-day tour of Central Kenya, State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena Mararo has said.On Saturday, Uhuru will meet with leaders from the region at Sagana State Lodge, Dena said in a statement.The closed-door meeting, whose main agenda is development, will be open to all invited Central Kenya leaders.""The head of state will also hold meetings with the leadership and residents to discuss national programmes among them, the Big Four agenda, the Building Bridges Initiative, curriculum reforms and the fight against Covid-19,"" Kanze said.Dena said Uhuru will also launch several complete national government development projects and inspect ongoing programmes. The President's itinerary on the inspection of projects and the meet-the-people visits will be shared with the media by the office on a rolling basis. Uhuru's engagements during his working visit have been planned in strict compliance with the national Covid-19 containment protocols. Uhuru will also be looking into education matters. He has praised parents who took their children back to school at the beginning of this month after a nine-month break brought about by Covid-19. ""As children settle in school after a long period of absence, the head of state would like to assure all parents that the government is committed to ensuring that learning continues uninterrupted,"" Dena said.Uhuru has also issued instructions to the Ministry of Education to devise ways of reintegrating children who became pregnant during the long break back to school. On schools fires, Uhuru warned those behind the destruction that the National Police Service is working with the Ministry of Education to deal decisively with anyone found culpable."
67,Court declines to lift orders seizing Akinyi's vehicles,"Controversial businesswoman Joyce Akinyi has lost a bid to have orders seizing her two motor vehicles set aside. Her vehicles were seized after an order by Justice Mumbi Ngugi following an application by the Assets Recovery Agency. The agency told the court they had reasons to believe that the vehicles are proceeds of crime. Akinyi filed an application seeking to set aside those orders. She contended that the preservation orders had heavily deprived her of means of reasonable living and caused her hardship.She said the order had greatly prejudiced her business, family and personal affairs. She contended that the Assets Recovery Agency had not availed or demonstrated any reasonable grounds to believe that the vehicles were obtained through illegitimate trade in narcotics. Justice James Wakiaga on Friday said Akinyi failed to show the court any hardship she had suffered or would suffer as result of the orders Ngugi issued.“She had an opportunity to disclose the nature of the hardship but she failed to do so. She further failed to show any link between the use of the said motor vehicles for business, family and personal purposes,”“The absence of that entitles the court to draw adverse inference in favour of the agency, that having been charged with the offense of trafficking in narcotic drugs, Akinyi will have to explain the source of her funds at the second stage of the proceedings,” Wakiaga said.The court said Akinyi could have easily explained in her affidavit how the preservation order has caused her hardship but she did not. “The court has only been asked to speculate about the hardship that Akinyi has suffered by the preservation order which could have been easily explained in her affidavit if any, leading me to conclude that she failed to prove hardship,”Wakiaga also said Akinyi failed to demonstrate to court how she relied on the motor vehicles in providing for her reasonable daily living expenses. Edited by P.O"

69,State House steers clear of Ruto allies' stern letter to Uhuru,"State House has steered clear of a letter by Mt Kenya MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto protesting their exclusion from President Uhuru Kenyatta’s meeting in Sagana on Saturday.State House spokesperson Kanze Dena declined to comment on the matter following questions fielded by journalists seeking the President’s response to the 11-page letter.“I will not be able to answer that question for now,” Dena said during a press briefing at Sagana State Lodge in Nyeri on Friday.Ruto allies, pitching their concerns as the President shifts base to Nyeri from Friday, cited the dire state of the economy, Ruto’s betrayal, and the President’s handshake with ODM leader Raila Odinga.They also lamented that the BBI had swept away Jubilee development plans under the Big Four agenda and further took issue with the President’s call to allow other communities to ascend to the presidency.The 41 lawmakers said they chose to raise the issues through the letter as they were not invited to the weekend meeting.President Kenyatta arrived at Sagana on Friday for his four-day engagements with the region which is restive following the heated 2022 succession politics and BBI referendum quest.But Dena, in her speech, addressed matters education – teen pregnancies and school fires; and government’s intervention to combat Covid-19 effects on the economy.Uhuru will hold a meeting with area leaders – invited - before embarking on a tour of complete and ongoing national government projects in Mt Kenya region, Dena said.State House said the meeting will discuss the Big 4 agenda, the Building Bridges Initiative, Curriculum Reforms, and the fight against Covid-19.“The closed door consultative meeting whose main agenda is development will be open to all invited Central Kenya leaders,” Dena said.“The President's engagements during the 4-day working visit have been planned in strict compliance with the Covid-19 containment protocols,” she added.She further stated the President’s commitment to safety of children in schools in the face of the rampant fire incidents reported across the country.“The President notes with great concern the increasing cases of arson in schools across the republic and would like to remind the perpetrators of the serious crimes that the National Police Service working with the Education ministry are under his firm instructions to deal decisively with anyone found culpable.”The President thanked parents who managed to take their children back to school at the beginning of the year despite the disruptions caused by Covid-19.“As the children settle in school after a long period of absence, the Head of State would like to assure all parents that the government is committed to ensuring that learning continues uninterrupted throughout the country,” Dena said.The President reiterated his directive to schools to readmit school girls who ‘regrettably fell pregnant during the long break’.“The President has issued instructions to the Education ministry to devise a mechanism for re-integrating them back into the school system,"" Dena said. Edited by P.O"
70,Mandera ordered to pay millions in salaries to sacked CECs,"Mandera county has been ordered by a court to pay salaries to four county executive committee members whose contracts were terminated by Governor Ali Roba's administration.Employment and Labour Court judge Onesmus Makau said the county had not paid the salaries and outstanding arrears as had earlier been directed by his court.Last year, the court ruled in favour of the four CECs and quashed their termination by the county government. The county was directed to pay them gratuity earned as at the date of termination plus salary for the remainder of their term.However, the county did not heed the directive prompting Abdiazizi Sheikh Maad, Shamsa Mohammed Haji, Johora Mohamed Abdi and Hassan Mohamed Ahmed to move to court.Makau said the county had not paid the CECs all their salaries for the unexpired term of the respective contracts of service even after issuing orders to that effect.“I have further found that the judgment dated April 29, 2020 did not give the county the option of withholding or investing the petitioner’s gratuity until they clear with the county government.”Makau ordered the county to compute the outstanding salary payable to each of the former CECs with less PAYE within the next 30 days.The court ruled that the the petitioners are entitled to salary set by SRC being Sh259,875 multiplied by the 32 months outstanding in their contract which comes to 8,316,000 each.The CECs argued that their salary for the remainder of their contract term should include all their allowances. The county however says only basic pay should be used to compute their salaries for that period.Justice Makau said he had considered both arguments and to him it was clear that the first three CECs salary was consolidated and SRC did not wish to give details of the allowances which constituted 40 per cent of the consolidated salary.“It is also clear that the said petitioners were entitled to other allowances and benefits by reason of their actual service to the public and the performance of their contract including airtime, official transport, daily subsistence allowance, medical insurance, other insurances and mortgage,” the court ruled.The allowances above should be excluded from their salaries and will not be used to compute their salaries for the unexpired period of the contract term.However, the fourth CEC salary is different because the component of his remuneration to be considered in computing his gross salary is the basic salary plus house allowance.According to court, his monthly basic salary was not fixed like for the other CECs noting that in 2020/2021, it was Sh138,400, in 2021/2022 Sh145,150 and from March 2022 was Sh152,010.The CECs had claimed that the county owed them Sh14.529,993.75, Sh. 12,033,021,4, Sh13,253,678.09 and Sh10,878,978.06 respectively. Edited by P.O"
71,Maina Kamanda: Last man left standing in Raila's Mt Kenya army,"They say in politics there are no permanent enemies, and no permanent friends, only permanent interests. The story is true of Raila Odinga’s once fierce critic turned bosom friend Maina Kamanda, a one-man army seeking to turn Mount Kenya in Raila's favour Kamanda, a veteran city politician is today the only trusted Raila’s commander in the vote-rich Central Kenya at a time a number of his colleagues from the area appeared to be developing cold feet.The lawmaker whose relationship with Raila over the years has been marked by strong loathe is now winning the heart of the opposition chief which has put him in Raila’s inner circle.In 2019, the politician broke ranks with his Jubilee party and successfully supported Raila’s candidate in the Kibra by-elections.Not long ago - before the handshake - Kamanda and Raila were not seeing eye-eye and on several occasions at crossroads over Nairobi politics.On Thursday, Makadara MP George Aladwa who jointly chairs Nairobi BBI team described Kamanda as a reliable team player.“He is good man, he is 100 per cent loyal to our course and to the two principals,” Aladwa said.He added: “He has served both Kibaki and Uhuru’s administration with great commitment and he is a top city politician who knows how to navigate the murky city politics. His loyalty is not in doubt.”Kamanda came to the political limelight in 1979 when he was elected a Councillor representing Ngara Ward. He retained his seat at the City hall in the 1992 polls.In the 1997 elections, he successfully contested the Starehe Constituency and served for two terms before losing to Margaret Wanjiru in 2007 elections.Between 2004 and 2005 he served as Assistant Minister for Local Government in retired President Mwai Kibaki’s administration before he was appointed Cabinet Minister for Sports and Gender from 2005 to 2007.He bounced back in the 2013 elections and served for another term as Starehe representative, losing the seat in the 2017 election to the current MP Charles Kanyi.He has not only supported the opposition chief from his comfort zone but even braved the recent skirmishes in Githurai market where Raila was met by anti-BBI youths who attempted to disrupt his entourage.Just like Jubilee Vice Chairman David Murathe, Kamanda has on several occasions endorsed Raila’s 2022 candidacy.From the long list of Raila’s Mt Kenya troop, only Kamanda has remained steadfast and is fashioning himself as the face of the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga in the vote-rich region.Last year, the former Starehe MP hosted Raila at his rural home in Ol Kalou, a meeting that was attended by bigwigs from the Kikuyu community.Among the high profile attendees were Governors Francis Kimemia (Nyandarua), Kiraitu Murungi (Meru), Martin Wambora (Embu), James Nyoro (Kiambu), Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga), National Assembly Majority leader Amos Kimunya, former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth, Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe and a host of MPs and Senators.The veteran politician was again at Raila’s Opoda home in Bondo when over 500 Kikuyu elders paid a visit to the opposition leader late last year."

73,Machakos Boys where charity is a daily lesson,"To one principal, teaching is not just imparting knowledge, it is a knighthood. And a school is more than a learning institution, it's a  community, a family.When Indimuli Kahi took the reigns at Machakos Boys in2018, he noticed a familiar scenario: an enormous number of bright and needy students who drop out without support.This pushed him to build a revolving fund with teachers and learners  voluntarily contributing to create a kitty that has since been the saviour for many students from poor backgrounds. It was not a new idea for him, having spent 35 years in the teaching fraternity and rising through the ranks to be a school head.Kahi told the Star in an interview most of the support given to needy students joining secondary school is short-lived.Challenges start as early as second term and you realise they cannot raise fees and they are disturbed. Some are courageous enough to come and tell the truth but others suffer in silence,” Kahi said.So when he joined Machakos Boys and found a similar situation, he gathered his colleagues, the teachers, to address the problem.His plan is simple, it's pegged to dedication and free will from the school community.This had already proved successful in two schools he headed, Vihiga and Chavakali Secondary.First, he proposed a monthly contribution of Sh200 from teachers through a kitty set up and managed by the school. The account was also circulated to other members of staff and parents.“Teachers and workers in school hold the institutions and students very close to their hearts. In fact, they turn out to be a family with compassion and empathy.""If well rallied, they live like a community, supporting each other,” Kahi said.He also mobilised learners to spare at least Sh50 from their pocket money when schools reopened. It was collected by teachers and given to the chairman of the kitty.Last year alone, the school fraternity supported 40 students by paying their school fees, having collected Sh580,000.The kitty is run by a committee with representatives from parents, the BoM and class teachers who identify the needy students to be supported. Kahi is the patron.Where need be, the committee visits  learners' homes to assess their financial situation.The school also holds harambees for the kitty during the school's thanksgiving day.Kahi said when he left Chavakali Secondary School, its kitty had about Sh2 million.""We have witnessed great support from parents as well, others donated more than the Sh200 we requested; others even ask to sponsor individual students in the institution,"" Kahi said.Requests are made of parents with ability to pay, but not everyone is able.Currently, the kitty has Sh280,000 available, the rest having been paid out.He says one of the biggest challenges is that the number of needy cases is increasing but the kitty does not grow at the same pace.They also have to remind some members to contribute and some learners are left out, crying foul.Kahi encourages other schools to create projects to help other children.""I would like to see the kitty grow and call the old boys to come back in and take the project as their baby, to grow the kitty and help others.""(Edited by V.

74,"Politicians on the loose, will cause anarchy - clergy","The Church and Clergy Association of Kenya (CCAK) has decried rising political temperatures and warned that the trend could lead the nation to anarchy.CCAK, an umbrella body that brings together churches and over 1,000 religious leaders said verbal exchanges being witnessed in rallies organised by top politicians risked causing divisions in the country.  “The political class is on the loose and could lead this nation to anarchy if the trend does not stop,” said CCAK chair Hudson Ndeda.He said the country is emerging from the rubbles of a pandemic and leaders must be watchful of what they say in public.“We demand civility in our politics, tolerance to divergent opinions and fidelity to the rule of law,” Ndeda said.Speaking at a press conference in Nairobi, Ndeda said the referendum debate and eventual general elections next year should not obscure Vision 2030“The level of energy being witnessed if directed to meaningful development could lead this nation to higher levels. The political noise is so loud that Kenyans hardly make sense of what the leaders are saying,” he stated.Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga have lately been trading barbs over the performance of Jubilee administration as they address their supporters in rallies.On Wednesday, Raila’s rally in Githurai, Nairobi, was disrupted by stone-pelting youths who chanted pro- Ruto’s hustler slogans.Traders in the area were forced to close down fearing looting and destruction of property.CCAK secretary-general Geoffrey Gichuki said it was regrettable that politicians from both divides are disregarding a presidential directive banning all political gatherings.“This could erode the gains made in the fight against Covid-19. Churches had to forego New Year night vigils. How come the government is unable to obey its own directives and demands Kenyans to comply,”  Gichuki said.Ndeda said the church will not be silent on the affairs of the nation that affect peaceful coexistence of the people.“The church is ready to assist the government to inculcate value system that strengthens the social, economic and political fabric of the nation,” he said.He added: “Mr President, guide the nation through what appears to be stormy political waters”On the BBI, CCAK urged members of county assemblies to rise to the occasion and debate the Constitution Amendment Bill 2020.“The bait in the document giving you control of five per cent of the devolved funds should not compromise your integrity on the way you vote,” Ndeda said.He maintained that the views of the church were not included in the document.“Until all Kenyans are included, the BBI will remain a document and not a guide,” he said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
75,Raila backs Maendeleo Chap Chap candidate in Machakos by-election,"The Maendeleo Chap Chap candidate in the Machakos senatorial by-election John Katuku has gotten a boost after ODM declared its support.ODM Machakos county branch chairman Peter Mutuku announced they will rally their members to campaign for Katuku and ensure he wins in the poll on March 18.“Today we had a special meeting convened to make our own decision on the by-elections in Machakos county,” Mutuku said.Mutuku said as a party they had met several times in their Machakos office and analysed all the candidates.“We have found a better replacement for Senator Boniface Kabaka and this is Katuku. We are proposing that Katuku be supported by all Machakos county residents,” he said.He said the decision by the ODM Machakos branch to support the MCC candidate was reached after several meetings involving the party’s county coordinating committee and its eight subcounty committees.Mutuku said they were supporting the MCC candidate since Jubilee had thrown its weight behind Wiper candidate Agnes Kavindu.“We have concluded Katuku will be our candidate as Jubilee is supporting the Wiper candidate,” he said.He said they hadn’t defected from former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s ODM but just joined their colleagues in Maendeleo Chap Chap.Mutuku said MCC also supported ODM's candidate in the Kibera by-election after former MP Kenneth Okoth died.“This is the time to repay and thank MCC for supporting us in Kibera. This friendship between us will not end after they win. We will put in more efforts so Katuku wins.”Katuku thanked ODM for endorsing him. He said he won’t let Machakos residents down.“I have what it takes. I have been a minister, assistant minister, MP alongside holding several other professional leadership positions. I will use my experience to source for funds for the county’s development,” Katuku said.He criticised those slamming his candidacy and calling him Governor Alfred Mutua's ""stooge"". Mutua is leader of MCC.He said his political rivals were trying to finish him politically and keep him from winning.“It is the role of MCAs to question ministers and governors on any misappropriation and corruption in county governments, not senators. President Uhuru Kenyatta is from Kiambu county and was elected on a Jubilee ticket. The Kiambu governor was also elected on Jubilee, senator and MCAs too,” Katuku said.Katuku said the narrative that he won’t be able to deliver since he belongs to the same party with the Machakos governor was incorrect.He said in Makueni county, the governor was elected on a Wiper ticket, as were the senator and majority of the MCAs.Katuku also got political support after Lawrence Mathuki, father of the acting Wiper secretary general and former EALA MP Peter Mathuki, endorsed him at Mutua’s office in Machakos town.(Edited by V.

76,"Is Ruto changing strategy to drive wedge between Uhuru, Raila?","Edged out of government power, Deputy President William Ruto seems to be changing his strategy to drive a wedge between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his handshake partner, ODM boss Raila Odinga.Could he possibly aim to win back the President's favour?In an apparent effort to set the two handshake partners on a warpath, the DP appears to have devised a new plan to gain favour with the President and portray Raila as the enemy within.Ruto – who has set his eyes on succeeding President Uhuru – has not been at ease since the two erstwhile political rivals closed ranks and shook hands on March 9, 2018. Ruto and the Nasa trio were excluded.The DP and his troops have perceived the handshake as a political arrangement aimed at stifling his ambitions of becoming the country’s fifth President in favour of Raila.Ruto has suddenly made an about-turn in his criticism of the Jubilee administration's performance as his ally- former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko make sensational allegations on the government on the 2017 election chaos that have the potential of dividing the ‘two brothers'.At a church service in Dagoretti South last Sunday, Ruto strongly supported the President and his administration’s development record and went ahead to list projects he and the President have completed since 2013.“The government of Uhuru and Ruto has built a railway line from Mombasa to Naivasha, almost 700 kilometres. We have built roads of 7500km, connected electricity to five million Kenyans, and built technical training institutes,” he said.The apparent change of heart - or strategy - came a day after he admitted Jubilee administration’s failure to realise its development agenda but blamed it on Raila for ""infiltrating and diverting"" the government priorities.Ruto scathingly attacked the former Prime Minister, accusing him of despising, humiliating and embarrassing the head of state with his constant attacks attack on Jubilee’s output.“If you have a problem with the performance of Jubilee government, I want to tell you to stop despising and humiliating President Uhuru. Stop talking to him in rallies,” he told Raila.He added, “You are saying Uhuru is your brother. Why  are you embarrassing him in public, saying the government has not done this or that?”Raila and his allies have lately criticised the government’s development record in their BBI and 2022 election campaigns.The ODM brigade has painted Ruto as the face of Jubilee's failures and accused him of trying to run away from his own government’s failures.They cited the laptop project, stadiums and creation of at least one million jobs for the youth every year as among the pledges Jubilee has failed to deliver.Of course, Raila has his own problems of being seen to be too close to Jubilee, no longer the champion of the poor and not a meaningful alternative, especially for those who don't remember the Second Liberation struggle.“Mr Six Months! The youngsters you promised laptops to 8 yrs ago are now old enough to see through your lies. The youth you promised 8 million jobs in eight years can see through the wheelbarrow lie you are now peddling. It has been 8 yrs, Mr 6 months and not 3yrs. No, Mr 6 months!” the ODM boss tweeted on Saturday referring to Ruto’s campaign promises to Kenyans.Political analysts Elias Mutuma and Mark Bichachi observe Ruto as a man out to exploit every opportunity that may create a rift between Uhuru and Raila.“The friendship between Uhuru and Raila is costing the DP...so he would ensure that the two go their separate ways so that he can have a better chance of succeeding his boss,” Mutuma said.He added that Ruto is wounded and feels his space was taken over by Raila and thus will be keen to take advantage of any scenario that would see them apart.""If he gets an opportunity to edge Raila out, he would not hesitate. He is taking advantage of the fact that there has been a bit of some discomfort within ODM circles [over the handshake],” he said.“Ruto understands everyone loves anyone who opposes the sitting government. That is why is roping in Raila so that he can increase his chances,” Bichachi saidAnd in what appears  part of the wider plan to split Uhuru and Raila, former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, a close ally of the DP, sensationally claimed  Interior CS Karanja Kibicho and other influential people in the Jubilee administration planned the 2017 election chaos, which was then blamed on ODM.Making the claims in the presence of the DP, Sonko alleged that he and influential people in the Jubilee administration, otherwise known as 'the deep state', printed ODM branded T-shirts.“We then bought second-hand vehicles in the showrooms and burnt them on Ngong Road so people would say it is ODM. It was 'the deep state' and 'the system',” Sonko said at the event in Dagoretti attended by the DP.Kibicho has denied Sonko’s claims and has already recorded a statement with the DCI. He has threatened to sue the ex-city county chief.Sonko’s assertions, however, triggered anger in Raila’s ODM and threatened to sever the cordial relationship the outfit and the President’s Jubilee Party enjoy.“ODM demands a full inquiry into the matter to establish the motives and extent of these mafia-like covert criminal acts as well as all persons and institutions involved,” secretary general Edwin Sifuna demanded.Uhuru and Raila – the main antagonists in the 2017 polls – have had a cosy relationship since they shook hands on the steps of Harambee House in March 2018.So close are the two leaders that during one of his allies in Kisumu, a place where he could not set foot before the handshake, Uhuru said Raila ""is now fully"" in government.  They have been calling each other brothers.The famous handshake has been credited for the restoration of peace and normalcy after the deadly and chaotic 2017 General Elections.The DP’s latest attacks on Raila for ""despising"" Uhuru can thus be interpreted as a change of tack in an apparent attempt to put the two leaders at loggerheads and scuttle the handshake.Ruto and his troops have been critical of the cooperation between the two leaders, terming it a plot to edge out the DP from succeeding Uhuru in 2022.On Friday, Ruto told Raila to take responsibility for the government’s failure to meet its development agenda.“They pushed their way into the government through the handshake, they took over committees in Parliament, they took over the running of government. They  now want to run away from their own failure,” the DP said.However, Raila has argued has argued he is not in government and took the blame to the DP’s doorstep for attempting to run away from Jubilee’s failures."
77,"DP Ruto trashes BBI as waste of time, money","Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday tore into the Building Bridges Initiative, saying Kenyans do not need it at all.In blatant defiance of his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta, Ruto said the Constitution Amendment Bill 2020 - currently before county assemblies - is a waste of time.It's a waste of time and money and does not demonstrate how the common man and woman will benefit.“Before they bring the referendum, can they explain to the common man how the position of Prime Minister and his two deputies and some 200 additional MPs will put food on the table for the ordinary Kenyan?"" the Deputy President asked.Ruto blamed the handshake between the President and ODM leader Raila Odinga for the failures of Jubilee administration.Ruto had pushed for several changes to the draft bill, some of which were included in the final draft launched in November last year.After the launch, Ruto pushed for a consensus among the top leaders before the plebiscite. He failed.But he has now come out guns blazing to oppose changes to the Constitution.The referendum is considered an early contest between Ruto and Raila to succeed the President.Addressing a roadside rally in Burma, Nairobi, Ruto said proponents of the constitutional amendments should stop lying to Kenyans that the law review would change the fortunes of the country.“We want them to speak the truth. You do not need to change the 2010 Constitution to give the youth interest-free loans. Just put money into the Uwezo Fund. A referendum is not needed for that,” Ruto said.The DP said supporters of BBI should not lie to Kenyans that the national government will increase its allocations to counties from 15 per cent to 35 per cent with new laws.“At the moment, the government owes counties Sh100 billion. If the national government cannot pay 15 per cent, why should we expect it to pay 35 per cent,” he asked.With the DP were MPs Isaac Mwaura (Nominated), Senator Millicent Omanga (Nominated), MP Mohammed Ali (Nyali), John Kiarie (Dagoretti South) and former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.Raila, on the other hand, has been holding rallies and meeting various groups to drum up support for the BBI.His counterparts Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Gideon Moi (Kanu) have also been going round popularising the BBI.The rallies have lately seen leaders from across the political divide brutally insult each other.In his address to traders in Burma, Ruto said his hustler narrative is not a war pitting the rich against the poor. “The hustler movement is about fighting poverty and negative ethnicity,” he added.He stated that his rivals had sensed defeat and resorted to saying that he is inciting the poor against the rich.“We have outsmarted them. That is why they are just talking about hustlers and wheelbarrows. People are enlightened and want to know how they will be empowered economically,” he added.Ruto further said Raila should stop talking about the failures of the Jubilee administration since he is now part of the government.“When you came to Jubilee and said Uhuru is your brother, didn’t you realise that there were no stadiums and millions of jobs were not there? If you want to leave, do it without causing so much commotion,” the DP said.He expressed confidence that the next government will be formed by hustlers.“Do not worry about what they are planning. They might have the system, they might be 'the deep state' but I have God and the people,” he stated.Ali and Sonko said the hustler movement will liberate the country from poverty and negative ethnicity.(Edited by V.

78,Ruling on case challenging transfer of meat commission delayed,"The High Court on Thursday adjourned the judgment of a case in which the Law Society of Kenya challenged the transfer of the Kenya Meat Commission to the military.Justice Antony Murima said the judgment was not ready because he was overwhelmed with work. He said he had no legal researcher to help with writing rulings.The judge said he had been informed the researcher would resume in February. In the case, the court is set to determine whether the state was right to transfer KMC to the Kenya Defence Forces.The LSK wants a declaration that the transfer is unconstitutional and an order quashing the President’s directive issued on September 7, 2020. It said the Executive order has ramifications as it would transfer associated budgets for the next schedule's supplementary budget to the Ministry of Defence.The society wants the court to quash the transfer and revert all the functions to the commission. It terms it unconstitutional, saying both the Defence and Livestock ministries have their functions spelt out.The LSK argued that the commission’s powers and functions are absolute and non-transferable.Section 8 (1) (b) of the Kenya Meat Commission Act assigns the functions of the commission to include carrying on the business on a wholesale basis of butchers, dealers and merchants in livestock and carcasses, fresh products, hides, skins and offals thereof and in poultry, ice and any other chilled, frozen or fresh foods, and of manufacturers and general dealers.“The Executive order amounts to the commercialisation of the KDF, which is inconsistent with the provisions of the Forces Act,” the LSK said.""The effect is KMC, which is a creature by Parliament, is a body corporate with its own functions and mandate that cannot be transferred or interfered with.”"
79,99 test positive as Kagwe warns of third wave,"Two more patients succumbed to Covid-19 on Thursday, raising the fatalities in the country to 1,753.This comes even as the Health ministry warned of a third wave should Kenyans throw caution to the wind amid reemerging political rallies that are pulling large crowds.“Most of the countries that have gone through elections and so on where people have flouted the rules, we have seen the impact and Kenya today is just on the verge of actually flattening the curve,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said on Thursday.“Even as the rest of the world is having all the issues that they are having we are in that comfortable position but, of course, if we are not careful we can start a third wave very easily and then we will have a tough time.”The CS confirmed that 99 more people had tested positive for the virus from a sample size of 4,758, representing a positivity rate of 2.08 per cent.According to data from the ministry, 476 patients are admitted in various health facilities countrywide while 1,363 are on home-based isolation and care.Twenty eight patients were in the intensive care unit, 14 of whom are on ventilator support and 13 on supplemental oxygen. One patient is under observation.Another 16 patients were separately on supplementary oxygen with 11 of them in the general wards and five in the high dependency unit.“My appeal to our people is that even if you are caught up in a situation where there is a crowd of people, at the very least ensure you have got a mask. You have less of a chance because you haven’t kept your distance but at least you have a chance to wear your mask,” Kagwe said.On a positive note, 66 patients recovered from the disease, 34 are from the home isolation and care while 32 are from our various facilities, pushing the total recoveries to 83,757."
80,Murang'a leaders form team to lobby for BBI,"Political leaders from Murang’a county have formed a committee that will lobby for the Building Bridges Initiative.The committee made up of eight elected MPs, county assembly speaker, chief whip and Governor Mwangi Wairia seeks to get overwhelming support for the BBI report.Each of the MPs will chair a sub-committee in the constituencies that will constitute all elected MCAs and representatives of teachers’ unions, women's groups leaders, clergy and farmers’ cooperatives.This comes amid growing concerns that the BBI reception in the county and the Central region is lukewarm.A section of the ward representatives pledged their support for the document while another said they needed to fully understand the document before they endorse it.Muthithi MCA John Mwangi  said his support for BBI will not be blind and he will  read the document before he makes a decision.His statement was endorsed by Mbiri MCA Muturi Mukwai who also reiterated the need for MCAs to understand the document to make informed decisions.Ichagaki MCA Charles Mwangi expressed confidence that Kenyans will endorse the document once they are well-informed about the content.Last week, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria held a meeting with a section of MCAs from the region during which they demanded to be incorporated in national politics.The MCAs said they have for a long time been ignored despite being closest to voters.But Wairia told the leaders that the document will be good for the county as it would see an extra constituency created and consequently channel more resources.“Why would we reject a document that will give us an extra Sh100 million in CDF allocation?” the governor asked.The county will also get an additional Sh6 billion should the BBI go through, Wairia said, adding locals should support it whole-heartedly.The meeting was attended by MPs Nduati Ngugi (Gatanga), Peter Kimari (Mathioya) Muturi Kigano (Kangema), Mary Waitehra (Maragua) and Woman Represenative Sabina Chege."
81,"Wildlife resources declined by 68% in 40 years, says report","Wildlife resources in Kenya have declined by 68 per cent over the last 40 years, a new report says.The State of Wildlife Economy in Africa report, a case study of Kenya by Africa Leadership University's School of Wildlife Conservation, says the decline has a negative impact on the economy.“Wildlife in Kenya has declined by an average of 68 per cent in the last 40 years, threatening the viability of the wildlife economy,"" the report says.Agriculture and tourism are the key drivers of the economy contributing 30 per cent and 12 per cent of GDP respectively and employing the majority of the populationThe report says Kenya needs to improve management of its wildlife resources to stem the decline and safeguard the flow of biodiversity and socio-economic benefits to the country.The report encourages more public and private investments in protected and conserved areas to improve biodiversity outcomes and support economic development.There are at least 7,500 plant species, 393 mammal species, 260 reptiles and amphibian species, 1,105 bird species and 769 fish species.Many of the species are globally significant, rare, endemic, endangered, and or threatened.The 2020 International Union for Conservation of Nature list of threatened species shows that Kenya has 456 threatened plant and animal species, with 75 protected through national and international law.Kenya has created an extensive network of protected and conserved areas to protect its species, including 23 national parks, 31 national reserves, four marine national parks, six marine national reserves and four sanctuaries.More than 60 per cent of Kenya's wildlife are in protected areas on community and private lands in the rangelands, making them important for future expansion of wildlife management areas.""Despite an extensive protected area network and heavy investment in wildlife conservation and management, there have been extreme and widespread losses of wildlife,"" the report says.Kenya has created 160 community and private conservancies covering 63,600, representing 11 per cent of the total land area.These conservancies host some of the most endangered species of global importance such as Grevy’s zebra and hirola, support livelihoods of over 707,460 households, and directly employ about 5,000 people.There are also 257 natural forests categorised as community forests, forest reserves and trust lands that cover 4.2 per cent of the total land area.These provide important habitat for wildlife and protect water and soil resources.Six protected areas have been designated natural World Heritage sites, while six have been designated Ramsar sites."
82,35% of Kenyans avoided hospitals for fear of contracting Covid,"Thirty-five per cent of Kenyans could not visit health facilities out of fear of contracting Covid-19, a report shows.The report, ‘Epidemic/Pandemic Response in Africa: Covid-19 in Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa’, was released by the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the Columbia University.The study shows 32 per cent could not afford to visit a health facility, five per cent said the nearest facility was too far, while 10 per cent said healthcare facilities were either too busy or they couldn’t get an appointment with a doctor.Only four per cent felt their healthcare needs did not seem urgent, thus decided to free up facilities for those who may need it more.Surveys from the Partnership for Evidence-Based Covid-19 Response (PERC) collected responses from 24,000 individuals in 18 countries across Africa, including the five under consideration in this study.The study examined actions taken in response to Covid-19 in the five major economic and cultural hubs in Africa. According to the report, initial contact tracing, quarantine, emphasis on personal hygiene, and social distancing all seem to have contributed to slowing the spread of the virus in Kenya.However, it faults Kenya for conducting very little emergency preparedness and response planning at just 12.5 per cent.“The lack of clear public health emergency legislation and the slow pace of establishing multi-functional public health institutes resulted in many problems and posed some serious challenges for all five countries,” the report states.“One of the more compelling problems is poor coordination between the health and security sectors and the failure on the part of the police and military to understand their roles and functions during a public health emergency.”It says many, if not most, of the conflict episodes between citizens and the police/military could have been prevented through better training and leadership, adding that when the police and the military overstep the mark, they undermine citizen trust in the state institutions that are responsible for their health and security.Some 72 per cent of Kenyans said they were satisfied with the government’s response to Covid, with the level of satisfaction being higher in the rural areas at 73 per cent.Similarly, five out of 10 Kenyans feel foreigners tend to discredit African indigenous medicines.“In terms of zoonotic exposure, Kenyans, whose country has great expertise in animal health, do not fear animal contact as much as Egyptians and Ethiopians do.”The report, however, lauds Kenya for launching direct communication systems for frontline healthcare workers two weeks before the pandemic landed in the county.“In Kenya, hotline #719, designed to field calls related to Covid-19, came into being and all calls were filtered through three call centres.  This was swift, by any standard.”It warns that the pandemic threatens to undo decades of progress made in reducing disease and increasing life expectancy, especially in the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases.For instance, access to outpatient care for childhood infectious diseases and treatment for Malaria, TB, HIV experienced between 50 and 74 per cent drop in the country.Routine vaccinations had between 10 and 24 per cent drop, while testing for mothers in antenatal care and HIV-exposed infants dropped by between 10 and 24 per cent during the period.Given the magnitude of the ongoing pandemic, the WHO has called upon all nations to prepare for the purchase, distribution, public health messaging and administration of Covid-19 vaccines as they become available."
83,New stents deal to end agony of throat cancer patients,"For people with end-stage throat cancer, mealtimes are terrifying moments.This is because as the tumour grows, it progressively blocks the food pipe. Eating bite-sized food feels like one is choking, or like something is stuck in the throat or the chest.To help the patient, doctors often insert a tube or (stent) in the oesophagus to keep it open to allow food and liquids to pass through into the stomach.However, the self-expandable stents are routinely unavailable in Kenya, not even in referral hospitals.Researchers say 90 per cent of oesophagus cancer patients in Kenya are diagnosed late and without the stents, they die prematurely of malnutrition.Two partners have now struck a deal with a US-based manufacturer of stents to acquire them at subsidised prices and train medics in the same.The collaboration brings together the Clinton Health Access Initiative, African Oesophageal Cancer Consortium (AfrECC) and manufacturer Boston Scientific Corporation.“Boston Scientific Corporation announced its commitment to launching an access programme to provide oesophageal SEMS (self-expanding metal stents) to patients in Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia at a subsidised price,” AfrECC says in a report it published in the Global Oncology journal.Currently, the overall cost of stent placement is about Sh40,000 inclusive of import and procedure-related expenses. Stents are usually 12 to 14 centimetres long and about two centimetres wide.AfrECC, which collaborates with Tenwek Hospital in Bomet, said Kenya has an age-standardised incidence of 8.3 per 100,000 people. This means at least 12,000 oesophageal cancer cases are diagnosed in Kenya every year. It is commonest in the Rift Valley, especially in Keiyo, Uasin Gishu and Nandi.Dr Shaheen Sayed, a pathologist at Aga Khan University Hospital, recently theorised the incidence could be linked to volcanic soils, tobacco chewing or smoking and the traditional fermented milk (mursik), which contains ash.AfrECC said squamous cell carcinoma is the dominant subtype in Kenya, normally caused by heavy alcohol consumption and smoking, but other risk factors have been documented as well.The authors say the stents can be used as the sole therapy or in combination with chemotherapy and radiation, with low rates of procedure-related and long-term complications.“Tenwek Hospital, a faith-based community hospital in Kenya, became a high-volume referral centre for patients with oesophageal cancer due to its ability to source SEMS at low cost,” they say.Experience at Tenwek showed that patients who got stents improved immediately, faced comparatively less financial burden, and were managed on an outpatient basis.The authors say 80 per cent of all oesophagus cancer patients in Kenya could potentially benefit from stent placement, and live a better life without surgery.The partners published their experience to demonstrate how such collaboration can improve the supply chain for high-priority medical devices."
84,DPP drops case against woman linked to Senator Kabaka death,"A high school teacher who was with former Machakos Senator Boniface Kabaka when he fell ill in a hotel room in Nairobi will not be charged with his death.The Director of Public Prosecutions told senior resident magistrate David Ndungi that a report from the Government Chemist and a forensic report did not find evidence to charge Esther Nthenya Muli.Prosecution counsel Abel Omariba said that the investigating officer had indicated that he had received the two reports and analysed them.“The reports indicate that the investigators have not found evidence to charge the suspect and they do not want Nthenya to be held further. We pray to withdraw the miscellaneous application,” Omariba told court.In his ruling magistrate Ndungi said he had considered the application to discharge the suspect as the evidence before court did not place her at the scene of crime.He noted that the DPP has a right to terminate the case and open an inquest. “The prosecution has confirmed to the court that they have no sufficient evidence to charge the suspect,” Ndungi said.The court also noted that Nthenya had been attending court without fail and allowed the application to terminate the case. “I allow the application by DPP to terminate the case and the suspect is set at liberty and is hereby set free,” the magistrate ruled.Nthenya, 45, was arrested in December and detained pending investigations. She was freed on a personal bond. The deputy principal at Mathemba Secondary School in Makueni county was detained as police investigated an attempted murder claim, but she was released after the Director of Public Prosecutions ruled out any criminal charges. The prosecution told the court that Senator Kabaka had driven himself to the apartment-hotel in Kilimani on the Elgeyo Marakwet Road in the afternoon.He booked a room where Nthenya joined him at about 3pm.The court heard the senator had looked well when he checked in and ordered food and drinks.The court was told the politician collapsed after he was joined by Nthenya. Food and drinks were served by the staff.The senator was rushed by an ambulance to Nairobi Hospital where he was admitted to the ICU. Surgery was performed on December 4, 2020, but he later died.Nthenya's lawyer Dan Maanzo (Makueni MP) told the press that she helped pay the medical bills of the deceased senator.“I am happy the DCI did speedy investigations which showed that my client was not involved in his illness. She found the senator unwell and took him to hospital and even paid the bills,”Maanzo said.Maanzo urged Kenyans to be ready to help others who are in need."
85,Calls for Lake Naivasha study amid pollution fears,"Stakeholders in Lake Naivasha have called for a detailed study of the water body after revelations that fish from Lake Nakuru is unfit for human consumption.They said they are anxious because rising water levels in the lake has flooded the area, including submerging tens of latrines in Kihoto estate.On Monday, the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute revealed that fish from Nakuru had high levels of metals, which could be harmful to consumers.This was attributed to sewage from Nakuru town finding its way into the water body that is home to thousands of flamingos.Lake Naivasha Water Resources User Association (LANARUA) chairman Enock Kiminta said, “It’s evident that there is pollution in Lake Naivasha from informal estates that have been flooded. Kemfri should conduct further studies on the effects of this.” Kiminta said they had engaged the county government to move with haste and upgrade the sewer system in the area, which was constructed in the early 1980s.“The current sewer system was meant to serve around 50,000 people but this has increased tenfold and the waste is not fully treated, hence the current crisis,” he said.Water Resources Authority subregional manager Jeremiah Nyaga said over 99 per cent of hotels and flower farms had adhered to the water treatment regulations.He said environmental laws had been set to guide stakeholders on the treatment of waste water to avoid cases of pollution around the troubled water body.“The Water Resources Authority is impressed by the manner in which these flower farms are treating their solid and water waste which is in conformity with the law,” he said.Agriculture CAS Linah Kilimo said according to studies, fish from Lake Nakuru rot within three hours while consumers interviewed had complained of skin rashes.“The report from Kemfri confirms that fish from Lake Nakuru is unfit for human consumption, and may cause diseases in the future,” she said."
86,GSK hands over 'Kenya' malaria vaccine to Indian firm,"The malaria vaccine being piloted in Kenya has been acquired by an Indian company.The vaccine was developed by British pharmaceutical GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), which on Wednesday announced it has transferred it to India’s Bharat Biotech (BBIL), a fast-rising pharma that has also developed its own Covid-19 vaccine.A GSK spokesman told the Star that although Bharat will own the vaccine, it did not buy it.""This is not a sale, BBIL is not paying GSK for the product transfer. This deal is about securing a long-term manufacturing solution for the vaccine beyond existing commitments through to 2029,"" the spokesman said.Bharat will progressively take over manufacturing of the vaccine (called RTS,S/AS01E) and own all rights pertaining to it by 2029, GSK said.GSK said it will only retain the adjuvant (AS01E) of the vaccine, which it will continue to supply to Bharat until 2042.An adjuvant is an agent added to a vaccine to create a stronger immune response in people, thus minimising the dosages needed.The vaccine is being piloted in Kenya, Malawi and Ghana to test the safety and feasibility of offering four doses.At least 65,000 children - in  Kakamega, Vihiga, Bungoma, Busia, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori and Siaya counties - have received three doses and will receive the final dose next month.GSK said in a statement that Bharat has a global track record of supplying World Health Organization prequalified vaccines at affordable prices to Gavi-eligible countries.“Helping secure the long-term future of the only vaccine available by working with an established leader like Bharat Biotech is vital for the continued fight against this devastating disease,” Thomas Breuer, the GSK chief medical officer and lead of vaccines global health, said.Path, a non-profit organisation that is supporting the pilot in Kenya, also backed the transfer.“With the signing of this agreement with Bharat Biotech, we have an additional, new partner to help ensure that this vaccine can be more widely available for use in Africa,” John Bawa, Africa head for vaccine implementation at Path, said.GSK and Path said the transfer will ensure adequate production if WHO recommends RTS,S for wider use – with more than 50 million doses needed annually.  The transfer is part of GSK’s current strategy to cut back operations in Africa, and slim down its vaccine R&D programme to focus on more profitable areas.GSK is said to have spent about Sh100 billion ($1 billion) on the malaria vaccine over 30 years, but there was no clear way to make it profitable.Each vaccine dose is expected to cost about Sh500 ($5), and it will cost about Sh2,000 ($20) to fully immunise a child, from six months of age.With most of Kenya being at risk of malaria, a nationwide vaccination is largely unfeasible unless supported by donors.Also, there are challenges regarding the vaccine’s safety, which the pilot is investigating.During the clinical trials, children who received the vaccine, also called Mosquirix, had a risk of meningitis 10 times higher than those who received a control vaccine.In all cases, mortality also doubled in girls who received the vaccine.The vaccine may not have triggered the meningitis cases, experts say.Convulsions after vaccination, though rare, also occurred more often in malaria vaccine recipients than in controls.In the trials, the vaccine reduced a child’s chance of contracting malaria by 40 per cent, with efficacy wearing off drastically four years after the final dose.Experts believe that the number of children who complete the four doses over two years will be much lower than the total number who began."

88,Djibouti rejects Mogadishu's bias claims in Igad's report,"Djibouti has dismissed claims that it was biased in authoring Igad's report on the current diplomatic tiff between Kenya and Somalia.In response to Somalia's claims, Djibouti said there is no doubt that the fat-finding mission was carried out with professionalism and impartiality.In a press statement on Thursday, Djibouti said while remaining strictly neutral, it was driven by the sole purpose to help Kenya and Somalia ease tensions between them.It said it adopted an unbiased approach based on strict objectivity.Somalia on Wednesday criticised the findings of a fact-finding commission, saying that there was no evidence that Kenya was meddling in its internal affairs.The report by Igad further indicated that Somalia’s grievances against Kenya were no justification to sever diplomatic relations.In an apparent indictment of Somalia, the Igad team says in its report: ""The Commission considers that these grievances, some of them long-standing, do not appear sufficient to justify a diplomatic separation between Kenya and Somalia.”The committee formed on December 22 after the 38th Igad Summit in Djibouti further termed Somalia's move as disproportionate and unproductive given the two countries are “intimately linked politically, humanely and economically”.“The consequences of this measure on the 3,000 Somali children attending Kenyan schools on the other side of the border, the hindrance to the functioning of Amisom, which has been experiencing difficulties in relief operations among Kenyan troops, and the economic impact of the embargo on khat in the agricultural region of Meru are a perfect illustration of this,” it said.The team Led by Djiboutian Ambassador to Kenya Yacin Elmi Bouh and his counterpart to Somalia Aden Hassan Aden and an Igad observer recommended diplomatic efforts at the highest level to reconcile the two states.But Somalia Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Minister Mohamed Abdirazak said his country will reject the report “in its entirety” because it the investigators had been “biased, partisan, unfair, compromised and predetermined to exonerate Kenya.”While threatening that his country will withdraw from Igad Abdirazak said Somalia strongly holds to all its initial accusations against Kenya and will pursue all means to protect her sovereignty.His sentiments were echoed by Minister for Information, Culture and Tourism Osman Dubbe who told reporters that report was biased.""The outcome of their report came as a shock to us. The report is one-sided. They [investigators] refused to go to the Somali territory. They went to Kenya twice, they went to Mandera. We wanted them to visit the Gedo region, but they refused to cross the border,"" the minister said.But Djibouti maintained that it has always strived for peace and stability in the region and made considerable efforts to contribute to the security, stability and peace in Somalia and remains committed to pursuing this endeavor.""The Republic of Djibouti recalls that the final report of the fact-finding mission was submitted to the current chairman of Igad, the republic of Sudan and to all Heads of state and government of Igad as well as to the executive secretary,"" read part of a statement.Djibouti said it is now up to the assembly of heads of state and Igad to determine the way forward and decide the best way to achieve reconciliation between Kenya and Somalia."
89,Magoha roots for corporal punishment to tackle unruliness,"Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha wants corporal punishment reintroduced in schools to stem runaway indiscipline among students.He said that though appearing atavistic, capital punishment holds the key to settling cases where ""students have grown horns.""The CS said school arson and attacks on teachers are on the rise, indicating a society going to the dogs. He spoke at Nyaburu Boarding Primary School in Kisii.""I may appear old school but I think we are at a time when we need to discuss how we can bring sanity in our schools and maybe bring the cane on board once more,"" Magoha said.Capital punishment if rightly used can significantly reduce many of the indiscipline cases in learning centres, he said.He urged parents to ""rein in their children from home"" as part of efforts to reduce deviance.""We are not going to accept that schools be dumping grounds for students who lack proper nurture and good foundation at their homes. It is such parents who again turn against teachers, accusing them of not doing enough to control their children. That should stop,"" he said.He said parents must begin getting time out of their busy schedules to counsel their children.""If they had time to plan to sire those children, then get time also to sit down with them, talk to them, otherwise we are not going to accept that schools be dumping grounds for spoiled kids.""Magoga said he grew up in a strict family where cane was being used and he cannot understand the hullabaloo about using it to instil discipline in a school setting.""I grew up in the villages where if I messed my parents could spare a few choicest strokes for my back; I did not die. I think we need a discourse on this issue once again. Otherwise, we are allowing our society to perish by copying everything from the West,"" he said.The Western approach to student discipline may not be the solution to the challenge of indiscipline in Kenya, Magoha said.He said failure to instil discipline at home has led to the rise in incidents where some parents go to court whenever their undisciplined children are sent home.""Courts have no role in student discipline, we must remove the gloves and face it,"" he warned.The CS said outlawing the use of a whip in schools may be among the reasons learners have ""grown horns"" and are giving teachers a difficult time.Several schools have been torched across the country for the last one week, with a section of parents calling for the reintroduction of the cane.In Nyamira, a primary boarding school was set ablaze Wednesday night. Hundreds of pupils slept in the cold. There have been similar incidents in 10 other schools across the country.Magoha said going forward learners from schools that had been torched will not be readmitted to other schools. He said he will issue a circular to that effect.Learners suspected of arson will be also be profiled as part of the broader efforts by the government to promote discipline. ""We have held discussions on this and are already decided. If any student is destroying property, he should know that he will not go scot-free; he must be made to pay,"" the CS said.On exams, the CS said preparations have reached top gear and burning of schools will not affect it. He told teachers to discharge their duties without fear."
90,LSK woes: Havi wants petition challenging resolutions quashed,"LSK President Nelson Havi has asked the court to dismiss a petition challenging the resolutions passed during their Special General meeting on January 18.Havi told Justice Weldon Korir that Adrian Kamotho has not exhausted the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available under the LSK regulations.""The petition filed by advocate Kamotho does not meet the threshold. He has not stated what rights have been denied or violated,"" he said.But Kamotho told the court that Havi should have filed a formal application to suspend the proceedings in court rather than filing an objection.He still urged the court to grant orders suspending the resolutions passed during g the meeting saying nothing stops it from doing so.Korir will render his decision on February 3.In this case, Kamotho is challenging a resolution that suspended the entire council of the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) during a Special General Meeting. Kamotho said a significant number of those physically present at the meeting were not advocates but hired goons with a clear brief to gag any voice alternative to that of their master.  LSK in a notice dated 18 December 2020 circulated to members, convened a special general meeting on January 18 this year.Going by the notice, the meeting was to be conducted via Zoom Online platform and physically at the LSK offices along Gitanga Road, Nairobi.The agenda of the meeting was also circulated in the said notice.A maximum of 300 members convened for the meeting physically at LSK Gitanga Road while the rest logged into the Zoom online platform.  Kamotho in his papers said LSK has over 18,000 members. Five percent of 18,000 translates to 900 members. “It is therefore clear that even if the 300 members physically present for the meeting at Gitanga Road did not constitute the statutory quorum,” he said.  Section 16 of the Law Society Act 2014, mandatorily sets the quorum of the general meeting to be at least five percent of all the members of the society.The quorum of the said meeting according to Kamotho was never ascertained.This he says questions the validity of the entire proceedings.  “Without credibly and validly registering a quorum the meeting held on 18 January this year remains a nonstarter,” he said."

92,Pro-Ruto MPs pen letter lecturing Uhuru as he visits Mt Kenya,"A group of 41 MPs from Mt Kenya, Nairobi and Rift Valley allied to DP William Ruto have written a stern letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta ahead of the visit to his backyard on Friday.In the letter, the MPs decry the state of the economy, alleged betrayal of the DP, political 'persecution' and Uhuru's handshake with ODM leader Raila Odinga.The 11-page letter also seeks to address what the MPs say is the shelving of the Big Four Agenda for BBI and also tells off the President over his recent utterances.""The mountain will remain restless, dissatisfied and defiant. Ultimately, full-blown revolt will be inevitable,"" the letter coming hours before the President tours the region concludes.Uhuru is expected to shift base to Sagana from Friday in an attempt to woo the region to support the BBI Constitution Amendments that arose from the handshake with Raila.The letter comes just weeks after Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata wrote to the President telling him that BBI was facing opposition in Mt Kenya.Uhuru dismissed the issue but has been on a blitz to woo the region and last week addressed the constituents through Kikuyu stations.On Thursday, in an interview with Kameme FM, Jubilee Vice-Chair David Murathe, a close ally of Uhuru said that Kang'ata was right but used the wrong method.Murathe said that the letter by Kang'ata was truthful and those telling the President that they have been campaigning for BBI are lying to him.The MPs, allied to Ruto, tell the President that they hope the issues they have said form the agenda at the meetings he will be chairing at the Sagana State Lodge.""This is important if we are to make real progress in advancing your programmes and legacy. If not, we are afraid this Sagana encounter will be yet another public relations talk shop, where those in attendance will collect Sh5,000 of public funds for no meaningful work,"" the MPs say in their letter.Those that signed the letter are drawn from various constituencies across all the Counties in Mt Kenya and its diaspora in Nairobi and Rift Valley.The letter opens with the MPs expressing their allegiance and support to the president but complain that they have not been invited to the Sagana meeting.On politics, the MPs remind Uhuru of the nature of his relationship with Ruto in 2013 as a means to end the ""politics of division and conflict, ethnicity, balkanization, deceit and betrayal.""They add that the President has taken a new turn in the conduct and practice of politics that has left many disappointed and outraged.They say that the Mt Kenya people are honourable people, whose lives and livelihoods are based on honesty and trust.""The new political agenda propounded by a faction publicly allied to you, which seeks to normalize treachery, dishonesty, deceit and betrayal as defining traits of our region and people is tragic, dangerous and unacceptable,"" the letter statesIt adds; ""We are honourable people, and we want it to be known always, in word and deed, that we stand for honour, honesty, integrity and trust in all of our dealings.""The MPs also says that they are also dismayed by the turn in the country's politics where there is the frequent use of abusive and disrespectful language against Mr Kenya people and their leaders.""The total erosion of civility at the highest level of leadership is a source of tremendous disenchantment throughout the Mt Kenya region,"" the letter states.On Raila, the MPs tell the President that, for 8 years from 2011, he consistently and persistently cautioned the region that Raila Odinga was Kenya’s foremost problem, and pleaded with voters to send him home for the country to move forward.They add that Uhuru was only emphasizing what the people already knew, taking into account Raila's history.""You blame the leaders and people of the Mt. Kenya region for being reluctant to accept the Handshake and the BBI. It is not their fault. The successful effort you made to persuade the people and render Raila Odinga unacceptable in Mt. Kenya cannot be undone in your lifetime,"" their letter states.The MPs also say that there has been harassment and humiliation of political leaders who agree with Uhuru through the use of State agencies.""After intimidation failed, our leaders were removed from parliamentary leadership positions and committees. These positions were given to ODM, the party we decisively defeated in the last election,"" the letter says.In the letter, the MPs tell Uhuru that he should withdraw recent utterances that two tribes have led the country since independence and it was good for others to take over.""We believe that Kenya is an equal-opportunity republic, where any person can rise to the pinnacle of their ambition lawfully through hard work. To insinuate that Kikuyus should not aspire for the Presidency, because others have been President, is unfortunate, insulting and selfish,"" the MPs said.On the economy and development, the MPs say that all the matters that were agreed upon during a meeting at the Regional Commissioner’s residence in Nyeri before the 2017 elections have not been addressed.""We presented highly detailed memoranda for every constituency, outlining projects agreed on before the 2017 election. The memoranda were all submitted to the Government for coordination and implementation. No subsequent meeting has made any reference at all to the issues raised nor indeed to the memoranda themselves,"" the letter states.The MPs add that the Mt Kenya economy is ""limping and groaning"" with the residents going through ""personal and communal suffering"" as a direct result of the government's policies.They say that policies related to import and export trade as well as demolition of structures in Nairobi and its environment have been used to impoverish people in the region.""As much as we appreciate infrastructure improvements and the efforts to spruce up urban areas, the humanitarian and economic impact of wanton destruction of property on vulnerable people has been inordinate,"" the letter states.Further, the MPs says that there have been discriminative policies affecting matatus and bodabodas during the Covid-19 pandemic.They add that miraa farmers have failed to get access to international markets yet the government facilitated the flower growers.""Despite your administration promising to focus on the Big Four agenda post-2017, agenda that would have created millions of jobs for our youth (jeshi), the same jeshi now languish in poverty after the Big Four agenda was abandoned in favour of the Small Two Agenda of the Handshake and BBI,"" the MPs say in the letter."

A journey that has enabled many Kenyans through the use of technology and digitization to access financial services, knowledge and to enhance their business capacities,"" Uhuru said.Uhuru said Kenya is aggressively expanding internet connectivity across the country and investing in skills development to enable young Kenyans to benefit from employment opportunities created by the digital revolution.ICT CS Joseph Mucheru, a former Google employee, attended the meetings alongside his Foreign Affairs counterpart Raychelle Omamo, State House Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita, his deputy in charge of Strategy Mrs Ruth Kagia and ICT PS Jerome Ochieng were also present."

95,Volatile area rescue: Give teachers guns for protection - Kuppet,"Kuppet has asked the government to provide guns and sufficient security training for teachers deployed in volatile regions.The union says as some teachers have been killed by gunmen in volatile areas in North-Eastern and Coast regions.Addressing the media on Thursday, acting Secretary General Moses Nthurima said arming teachers with guns will not only scare away attackers but will also give the tutors confidence.“In the pockets of insecurity, teachers must be trained and provided with guns. You cannot confront a gun man with chalk. When we take a teacher to insecurity-prone areas, that teacher will constantly live in fear,"" he said.""But if the gun is hanging on his back even bandits will know that a teacher is a no-go zone and they will take a second thought before making any mistake.""On Wednesday, the body of a high school teacher who apparently drowned five months ago was found without the head and limbs.John Murunga, a teacher at Nalutili Secondary School in Bungoma county, was found in River Kipkaren in Lugari, Kakamega county.In Kapedo, hundreds of families have fled, schools and businesses have closed during the fierce security operation to flush out criminals on the border of Baringo and Turkana.More than 2,000 learners are out of class, many are in makeshift IDP camps, after more than 15 schools where shut down in volatile areas of Kapedo and Tiaty subcounty, Baringo.At least 10,000 people have been displaced.Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i said the attacks are carried out by organised criminal gangs, not 'ordinary' bandits as in the past.The schools closed indefinitely in Tiaty are Katuwit, Chepilat, Lemuyek, Chesirimion, Ng’inyang, Chemolingot, Cheptunoiyo, Chemeril, Naudo, Nalegat, Chesirimnyon, Kositei,  Komolion and Chepkalacha primary schools. Others are Kapedo Mixed Secondary, Kapedo and Silale primary schools - the area has been locked off.

96,IG puts boda boda riders on notice over cases of hooliganism,"Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai has put boda boda riders on notice over rising cases of hooliganism and attacks on other motorists, especially when one of them is involved in an accident.In a statement on Thursday, Mutyambai said there have been incidents where victims of accidents where riders are involved have been assaulted and in some instances their vehicles burnt.""It is against this backdrop that I caution all boda boda riders and operators against such uncouth and uncivilized manner of addressing issues,"" Mutyambai said.The Inspector general of police said the riders must adhere to all traffic regulations.""Failure to which they will be dealt with in accordance to the law individually. When such an incident happens, report to the nearest police station or security office,"" he said.Mutyambai further directed police officers to be on the lookout and take necessary measures against any rider found to be taking the law into their own hands.""The police will map out the hot spots where such incidents have or are likely to occur and undertake a major operation to address the problem,"" he said.In September 2016, the government scrapped the Sh10,000 excise duty previously levied on motorcycles.This opened the floodgates for the purchase of motorcycles, whose number had peaked at 159,260 units between January and October 2018, according to statistics from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.Between January 2018 and March 4, 2019, approximately 4,190 motorcycles had been impounded for flouting traffic regulations in the city.Cumulatively, the riders arrested had to part with Sh12.7 million in storage fees and court fines."
97,"Kenya rebuffs Somalia's 'meddling' claims, says they're meritless","Somalia should desist from dragging Kenya into their domestic issues, Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna has said.Addressing the media on Thursday, Oguna said Kenya will not accept to be drawn into Somalia's internal politics.Oguna said the events being witnessed around Mandera have their genesis on domestic political activities in Somalia.""The recurrent confrontations between these forces, not only cause fear and panic amongst our people at the border town of Mandera but also do lead to the displacement of civilians from Gedo region in Somalia,"" he said.He also rejected allegations that its military in Somalia engages in illegal sugar and charcoal trade. ""They live in fox holes. At what time do you leave fox holes to go and trade in charcoal?"" he said.He urged all leaders in Somalia to create an environment that will facilitate the resolution of the conflict through dialogue.""This is critical in fostering a united front in countering militants who have, for a long time, destabilised peace and security in Somalia and the region,"" he said.""Allegations by Somalia that Kenya is sponsoring and harbouring militia with the objective of destabilizing Somalia are not based on any merit. ""Oguna said Kenyans are known for their generosity and hospitality.""Due to this, it is here that most Somalis run to whenever violence breaks out in their country. They still do cross over into Kenya to seek certain services,"" he said.""It would therefore be counter-productive for Kenya to want to destabilize the very people it offers a refuge.""He said that the accusations by Somali are diversionary and intended to redirect the attention of the Somali people away from real issues on the ground. ""We are a peace-loving people, in a country governed by the rule of law and guided by the principle of non-interference,"" he said.On Monday, a fact-finding mission established by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development dismissed allegations from the Somalia government that Kenya was infringing on its sovereignty.According to the mission, the decision by the government of Somalia to sever diplomatic relations with Kenya was uncalled for and has negatively impacted the lives of Somali nationals who seek relief and amenities in Kenya.Kenya said that it is now evident that the simulated crisis being contrived by Somalia does not advance IGAD’s vision for achieving peace, prosperity, and regional integration.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the impartial report will settle the matter, adding that Kenya will not be drawn into “this reckless campaign whose sole intent remains the creation of artificial fissures for parochial and domestic political ends at the expense of regional peace and security.”"
98,Manhunt launched for man who defiled 13-year-old girl in Makueni,"A manhunt has been launched for a 31-year-old man suspected to have defiled and impregnated a school going child in Makueni. While at school, the 13-year-old pupil at Kathonzweni Holy Ghost Mission Primary had complained of abdominal pain.This forced the school's administration to call her mother to take her to hospital. ""Examination on her condition revealed that she was expectant, thereafter disclosing to have been defiled by the suspect,"" DCI director George Kinoti said.The suspect, Reuben Mutie of Kwa Kavisi location, has since been on the run.""Should anyone have information on the suspected paedophile on the loose, please call our toll-free hotline 0800 722 203 for immediate action,"" Kinoti said.Last month, a similar case was reported where a Meru bodaboda rider was said to have defiled an eight-year-old girl.Detectives said the suspect offered the girl a ride to her home at Baibariu in Igembe South, but along the way diverted to his house where he committed the act.He later dropped the helpless minor near their homestead before taking off into hiding.This was a day after a Kenya Defence Forces soldier was arrested for defiling a minor."
99,Court terminates case against teacher linked to Senator Kabaka's death,"A Nairobi court has terminated a case against a high school teacher who was held but later released over the illness of the late Machakos Senator Boniface Kabaka due to lack of evidence.The court on Thursday terminated a miscellaneous application against Esther Muli.This was after the DPP made an application to withdraw the case against Muli citing that the evidence produced did not place her at the scene.The prosecution said a report from the forensic and government chemist indicates that the investigating officer did not find evidence to charge the suspect.""The investigating officer does not want the suspect to be held further. We pray to withdraw the miscellaneous application before this court"", the prosecution said.While discharging Muli, Senior Resident Magistrate David Ndungi said that he had considered the application by the DPP to discharge the suspect.""The evidence does not place her at the scene of committing the crime,"" he said.He noted that the DPP has a right to terminate the case and open an inquest in the case.""The application is marked as terminated and I have discharged the suspect,"" Ndungi ruled."
100,Igathe: My resignation as Nairobi deputy governor never formalised,"Will the real Nairobi deputy governor please stand up?The dispute over the Nairobi governor's seat, succession and a by-election has been thrown into further disarray after former Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe asked the court to determine whether his resignation was formalised.While acknowledging that he resigned in January 2018, Igathe said that the meaning of the county's failure to recognise his resignation should be determined by the court.In an affidavit, Igathe said his letter of resignation was not acknowledged by the speaker of the Nairobi City County Assembly. The affidavit was dated January 12 and made available on Wednesday.“The legal effect of the failure to formalise or recognise my resignation and the failure by Nairobi County or any public institution to conduct any legal formalities to conclude my resignation is a matter to be determined by the court,” he said. Igathe was responding to a case in which a Nairobi voter - Patrick Kiiru - is challenging the Nairobi gubernatorial by-election initially slated for February 18. Kiiru says the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has no right to call a by-election to fill the vacancy in the office of the governor, especially when there is a deputy governor in place.A by-election would be a messy affair, with victors holding office for only a short time.He says Igathe should automatically take over as his resignation was never communicated to the electoral agency. The case is to be heard on Wednesday before Justice Weldon Korir. “The impending by-election as gazetted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is premature and unconstitutional,” Kiiru said.The gazette notice was preceded by the impeachment of Mike Sonko as governor but Justice Anthony Mrima has since suspended the notice following a case filed by Sonko. Igathe ran as Sonko's running mate on the Jubilee Party ticket in the 2017 General Elections. “I served in the position of Deputy Governor until I formally tendered my resignation by way of letter dated 12 January to the speaker of the Nairobi City County Assembly,” Igathe said.He said having formally tendered his resignation, he commenced other career engagements away from the public office he held pending all formal responses. ""With regards to the legal steps to be taken to formalise my resignation, I am not aware if the same were conducted,” Igathe said.Kiiru in his court documents said the resignation of Igathe was never communicated to the IEBC, nor was any gazette notice published announcing a vacancy in the office of the deputy governor. “Having officially confirmed that it wasn’t aware of the vacancy in the office of the deputy governor, it can only be said that the gazette notice by the IEBC was based purely on hearsay and media reports as opposed to the law,” the voter said.There being no vacancy in the office of the deputy governor, Igathe ought to have assumed office for the remainder of the governor's term, Kiiru argued.(Edited by V.

102,Ruto's Mt Kenya allies locked out of Uhuru's Sagana meeting,"Allies of Deputy President William Ruto have been left out of a BBI unity meeting to be presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta in Nyeri on Saturday.The consultative meeting to be held in Sagana comes amid lukewarm reception of the Building Bridges Initiative referendum from the Mt Kenya region.In yet another move signalling that the President is ready to work without the leaders affiliated to Ruto, provincial administration, Jubilee Kieleweke-allied MPs and governors have been tasked to identify key individuals to attend.As of Wednesday, the leaders had selected representatives of the business community, youth groups, teachers' unions, the clergy and opinion leaders.But Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua told the Star on the phone that the meeting will achieve nothing ""as the President will be preaching to the already converted”.The vocal MP, a close ally of the Deputy President, said: “The facts remain the same, the BBI referendum is unpopular in Mt Kenya.“I have not received any invite so far. The very people who will be ferried from various parts of Central will not tell the President the truth. They are the same praise and worship team who have chosen the path of destruction.”Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata sparked an uproar when he wrote to Uhuru, warning that he needed to change tack in the BBI campaigns to quell resistance.Kang’ata, in his letter, stated that the use of provincial administrators to market the proposed changes to the 2010 Constitution was not bearing fruit. The Senate Majority Whip also blamed the divisions that have split the ruling party into Tangatanga and Kieleweke factions as harmful to the BBI. Kang’ata said that it was a high time Uhuru bent backwards and rallied all MPs, irrespective of their political factions, behind the BBI.“The BBI is being framed as a Jubilee factional agenda. Our internal Jubilee problems have been weaponised and are being used to deflect our people from the benefits of the BBI,” he said in the letter, which has informed Uhuru’s meeting.“Government-supporting legislators in the region have been edged out of BBI programmes in favour of their local political competitors.”Kirinyaga Woman Representative Ngirici Wangui said the meeting will have no impact as the region has decided not to support it.Speaking to the Star, the legislator said that since the handshake, Uhuru has mistreated leaders from the region and “his administration has made the lives of Mt Kenya residents difficult.""She went on: “Let them go and unite themselves if that's what pleases them. We have better things to do; the people of Mt Kenya have no businesses, no money. The Uhuru administration has killed the livelihoods of our people and he cannot now come seeking our support, yet he was not available when we needed him the most.""Ngirici appealed to Mr Kenya MCAs to reject the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, which has been forwarded to them by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. “MCAs should listen to what Kenyans are saying. The proposed changes will be too expensive for the taxpayers and they should reject them despite the coercion and inducement that will come their way,” she said.Chinga MCA Kiruga Thuku, another Ruto ally from Nyeri, said he will attend if invited. He, however, said the people of Central have rejected the BBI “as it is meant to assist ODM leader Raila Odinga to ascend to power”.“You cannot divorce BBI and 2022 succession politics. The people of Mt Kenya fully support the Deputy President and that cannot change. We have no business supporting a document that has been tailored to help Raila and his team get to power,” he told the Star on the phone."
103,Why BBI could make or break Raila and Ruto,"Deputy President William Ruto and ODM boss Raila Odinga are locked in a ferocious war over proposed constitutional changes that will shape the 2022 presidential contest.And their futures.The BBI referendum is tentatively scheduled for June, about 13 months to the general election, and is turning out to be a double-edged sword that will make or break careers.Whoever carries the day in the high-stakes referendum will likely have the upper hand and the much-needed momentum going into the campaigns for 2022.“The results of what happens in the midterm definitely affects what happens in the full term. Anyone who wins a referendum in 2021 will have a greater chance going into 2022,” political analyst Mark Bichachi said.Raila and his handshake partner President Uhuru Kenyatta are the principals driving the push for constitutional change.On their side for change are Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka, Gideon Moi and Moses Wetang'ula.In addition, nearly all governors except Makueni’s Kivutha Kibwana are supporting the plebiscite.However, Ruto and his foot soldiers have opposed the changes, saying a referendum is an unnecessary and expensive affair when the economy is on its knees.Ruto has managed to galvanise his Rift Valley backyard against BBI.Analysts also say the DP has turned Uhuru’s own Central Kenya backyard into a swing vote region - a major litmus test for the President as he begins his tour of the region tomorrow.  Ruto’s stand has poisoned his relationship with Uhuru and redefined the Jubilee succession matrix.The President now says it’s time for a non-Kalenjin, non-Kikuyu president, a declaration that has smashed what remained of the brittle to a nonexistent working relationship with Ruto.Soy MP Caleb Kositany, a close Ruto ally, on Wednesday told the Star Kenyans are not interested in BBI and will roundly reject it in a public vote.He was non-committal, however, on whether they will mobilise county assemblies to reject the bill.“BBI is coming at the wrong time when we have serious economic issues. There is nothing so urgent in BBI that cannot wait. Kenyans do not want it. If they push it to a referendum, then that is where Kenyans will express their feelings,” Kositany told the Star.Ruto has over the last few weeks been meeting MCAs from across the country in what insiders say is a strategy is to marshal their support to kill the referendum drive. An analysis by the Star shows about 21 counties would easily pass the Bill. These are counties that largely voted for Nasa in 2017.They include Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Tana River, Taita Taveta, Makueni, Kitui, Machakos, Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii and NyamiraOthers are Busia, Bungoma, Kakamega, Vihiga, Nairobi and Isiolo.However, the Bill could be rejected in Kalenjin-controlled counties of Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Kericho, Bomet, Baringo, Turkana and Elgeyo Marakwet.Most of the other counties, including Uhuru's Central Kenya backyard, are divided and could be swing votes. Analysts say the plebiscite will trigger realignments.Losers will have an uphill task rebuilding their teams and crafting a working strategy to sway voters a few months to the general elections.“Unavoidably, the referendum outcome will lead to a certain level of realignment and a new battle formation. For Raila and Ruto, it will greatly inform their strategy for the general election,” Javas Bigambo, a political pundit, observed.This has been the case in the past where winners of plebiscites come out stronger and with formidable formations for the general elections.In 2005, the ‘NO’ camp christened ‘Orange’ won the referendum to change the Constitution against the ‘Yes’ or ‘Banana’ side.Orange, which was then headed by Raila, birthed the Orange Democratic Movement – a lethal political machine that nearly vanquished then-President Mwai Kibaki from power.Kibaki who led the ‘Yes’ camp was controversially declared the winner of the 2007 polls, triggering massive protests and chaos.More than 1,300 people were killed and about 600,000 others displaced from their homes as supporters of the opposition protested the results of the elections.On Tuesday, the IEBC sent the BBI Bill to all the 47 county assemblies – making the regional legislatures the new battleground for the constitutional changes.The political battle has begun with rallies being rolled out. Raila has embarked on meet-the-people tours, town hall meetings and media interviews as he markets the document that he says carries the hopes and aspirations of Kenyans.In the past two weeks, the former Prime Minister has toured various parts of Nairobi, met youths and other groups and given an interview to a Kikuyu vernacular TV station.He disclosed in one meeting that the BBI secretariat was already printing summarised books of the BBI Bill to help Kenyans read and understand the document.On Wednesday, Raila marketed the document in Roysambu and Githurai.His party, meanwhile, said it will on Tuesday meet more than 500 MCAs to encourage them to support the Bill when it comes up for debate in their assemblies.“We have invited experts who will explain everything to them. We want them to debate the Bill from an informed standpoint,"" ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna said.He added, “We want to do it the way the Thirdway Alliance party did it. They moved across the county assemblies educating them about the Punguza Mizigo Bill and then ask the ward representative to support it.”The Bill, however, flopped after it failed to get the approval of at least 24 of the 47 counties to move through to the next stage.President Uhuru, whose Mt Kenya backyard has been the centre of attention, has sent a battery of top government officials to prepare the ground for BBI.The head of state is to meet leaders from the expansive vote-rich region at Sagana State Lodge. The session is termed as an effort to ward off the DP's growing influence in the region.On Wednesday, Cabinet secretaries held a closed-door meeting with leaders in Nyeri where they drew up a roadmap to market the document.“On average, we are targeting between 70 and 90 per cent support for BBI in Mt Kenya. We now have the Bill and we are going to tell the people how this Bill stands to benefit them,” Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu said.BBI secretariat co-chairman Dennis Waweru said they have started printing summaries of the BBI booklets as they prepare to hit the ground to debunk the ‘lies’ propagated against the drive.Ruto has strategically picked point men from Central Kenya who have been credited for his penetration of the region.Like Raila, the DP has launched massive campaigns against the drive and intensified boardroom meetings with MCAs from various assemblies, ostensibly to persuade them to reject the document.Last week, he met MCAs from Kajiado and Mandera as well as senators and members of the National Assembly at his Karen residence.His handlers disclosed that more meetings are lined up for this week and MCAs from Murang'a, Nyeri and Kirinyaga are expected to visit him. (Edited by V.

104,"KCPE, KCSE exams at stake as unrest rocks schools","The recent spark of school unrest has emerged as a worrying trend that could hurt preparations for KCPE and KCSE exams.With fewer than 60 days to the start of the national examinations, preparations have entered the homestretch. Stakeholders have, therefore, called for intervention to arrest the situation.In the past week alone, dormitories in at least six schools have gone up in flames, leading to the destruction of property.The schools include Kisii High, Bukembe Boys' High in Bungoma, Kirimari and Kiambere secondary schools in Embu county, Kisumu School and Itigo Girls in Nandi.  This is in addition to attacks on teachers by students witnessed in the early weeks of school reopening.KCPE exams commence on Monday, March 22 and end on Wednesday, March 24. On the other hand, KCSE candidates will undergo their rehearsals on March 25 before sitting their exams from March 26 to April 21.Nicholas Maiyo, the Kenya Parents Association chairman, warned on Wednesday that more schools could witness unrest in February.Maiyo said teachers were inadequately prepared for the reopening, leading to a disconnect with learners who had been out of school for 10 months since the beginning of the closure due to Covid-19.""A child coming back to class after 10 months is not the same child a teacher was dealing with in March last year... Some of them (students) engage in words exchange with their parents and when you impose rules and orders on them in school, the result is confrontation and even riots,"" Maiyo said.Maiyo further blamed the problem on poor parenting during the shutdown and exposure to criminal activities or violent content. He was also of the view that some learners are stressed out and are suffering from exam fever.He called for a new approach to handling learners and swift training by the Teachers Service Commission. He also encouraged parents to take time to talk to their children, more so those in day schools.Education CS George Magoha earlier this month blamed parents for the increased student attacks on teachers. Magoha urged law enforcement agencies to take stern action against identified cases and appealed to teachers to take care of themselves.""The problem is that parents are not giving their children tough love... because for nine months, a child has been at home and you've been treating him like an egg and you expect the principal to instil in him discipline; what do you think will happen?"" Magoha said.Some 1,191,411 candidates are registered to sit KCPE exam. The test will be administered in 28,451 centres.Another 752,933 candidates will sit KCSE exam in 10,437 centres, an increase compared to 10,287 centres in 2019.The Kenya National Examination Council has been readying itself for the exams but is grappling how to go round adverse weather conditions as the tests will be conducted during the long rains season.The council also cited insecurity and flooding of major lakes and rivers in various parts of the country."
105,489 patients hospitalised as one more dies of Covid,"A four-month-old child is among the latest 130 Kenyans to test positive for Covid-19.The oldest patient was aged 88 years as per the data released by the Ministry of Health on Wednesday. The death toll rose to 1,751 after one more patient died.In a statement, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the new cases were from a sample 4,918 tests conducted within 24 hours, representing a positivity rate of 2.6 per cent. All of the cases were Kenyans except 15.“There are 489 patients currently in various health facilities countrywide, while 1,353 are in home-based isolation and care,” Kagwe said.“Twenty-eight patients are in intensive care units, 14 of whom are on ventilator support and 13 on supplemental oxygen. One patient is under observation.”Another 17 patients were separately on supplementary oxygen, with 12 of them in the general wards and five in high dependency units.“Today, 66 patients have recovered from the disease, 42 are from the home-based isolation and care, while 24 are from various facilities. The total recoveries now stand at 83,691.”Nairobi recorded 87 new cases; 16 of whom were from Dagoretti North; nine from Makadara; five each from Lang’ata and Ruaraka; four each from Kamukunji, Kibra, Roysambu and Westlands; and three from Starehe.Embakasi North, Embakasi South, Kasarani and Mathare recorded two cases each, while Dagoretti South, Embakasi Central, Embakasi East and Embakasi West each recorded one case.Other counties that recorded new cases include Taita Taveta with 18; Mombasa with nine; Nakuru and Narok with six each; Siaya, Uasin Gishu, Kiambu and Kisii with four each; Kilifi with two; while Kisumu, Bungoma, Busia, Kajiado, Kakamega, Nyamira and Nyandarua recorded one case each."
106,NMS to clear Sh1.3bn pending bills after contracts handed over,"Service providers can now heave a sigh of relief after the city county finally handed over Sh1.3 billion for pending bills to the Nairobi Metropolitan Service.The bill is for services rendered during the 2019-20 financial year.Acting Governor Anne Kananu on Wednesday officially handed over all contracts to NMS director-general Mohammed Badi, 10 months after City Hall transferred the management of four key functions to the national government.The functions include health services, transport, planning and development, public works, utilities and ancillary services Kananu said the amount of the pending bills was arrived at after the National Treasury requested the Office of the Auditor General to undertake a special audit in line with the Public Finance Management Act.“Nairobi county procures services and goods from different entities. It is expected that payments be honoured according to the contract terms since the accumulation of pending bills had raised concerns in the recent past and has put suppliers on the edge,” Kananu said.Contractors and suppliers were to be paid after Benson Mutura signed the warrants on December 21, 2020. Mutura was then serving as acting governor following the impeachment of Mike Sonko.Sonko had refused to sign the warrant back in October, thus blocking cash flow in the county.The former governor had moved to court block the implementation of the 2020-21 Sh37.5 billion budget.Mutura last month said the court allowed the county to enter into consent agreement over the implementation of the budget.""The county has begun the process of paying its service providers. The funds are there and it is now just a matter of organising the records and the order of who will be paid first,"" he said.Kananu said they will adopt a phased approach to settling outstanding arrears even if it means settling bills in instalments in certain circumstances in order to restore liquidity for business owners.Last year, the county assembly raised concerns that the delay in settling pending bills had led to confusion on who between the NMS and City Hall is supposed to pay after the deed of transfer.Kananu urged the NMS to make pending bills payments the first item of expenditure on their budget.Badi said his team will renew contracts that lapsed while those still valid will remain actionable.City Hall had initially refused to submit documents linked to the transferred functions, forcing NMS to seek new contracts.“This has been a long journey and we are very happy that the official handover of all the contracts concerning the transferred function has happened. Now that we have all the contracts with us, projects will proceed as expected,” Badi said.He said NMS was relieved that it can now work seamlessly with City Hall and the county assembly.Badi assured that no money would be lost and payments to contractors will be done on time.He said NMS last year faced challenges in paying contractors and suppliers after the former governor had refused to hand over contracts.“NMS had experienced some hiccups last year with the county over the payments of pending bills but we can now finally move forward and work seamlessly with the county and assembly,” Badi said.He assured service providers that NMS will renew contracts of the suppliers whose term had ended.“As NMS, we shall ensure that all contractors are paid on time. We are looking forward to working with those whose contracts are still on course,” he said.Speaker Benson Mutura praised the efforts by the executive and NMS to ensure that Nairobi was transitioning on the right path. “Nairobi had been run like a criminal entity but now we can see the transparency of work between the county and NMS,” he said.Despite the goodwill to work together, Mutura emphasised that the county assembly will properly carry out its oversight mandate to ensure that city residents get the services they deserve."
107,Rape convict's jail term reduced from 20 to eight years,"A man convicted of raping a drunk woman has had his 20-year jail term reduced to eight years after winning an appeal.Chris Maingi was convicted in 2019 after he was found guilty of raping the woman in 2017. The two had met in a club in Kajiado Township.In his appeal, Maingi argued the woman was drunk, hysterical and distressed. She could therefore not afford the shame of having been caught in the act and that was why she alleged he had raped her yet they had consensual sex.Justice Chacha Mwita on January 22 considered that Maingi was arrested on July 5, 2017 and was in remand throughout his trial which ended in February 2019 when he was sentenced.“Having considered the appeal, I find no merit in the appeal on conviction and I dismiss it. On sentence, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed was harsh. The sentence of 20 years is hereby set aside. In place, therefore, the appellant is sentenced to eight years. The sentence of eight years shall run from July 5, 2017 when he was arrested,” Mwita ruled.In the case, the victim testified that on July 4, 2017 at 11 pm, she asked a boda boda rider named Daniel Kantai to take her to a bar on her way home. She found three other patrons there.She took a seat and started enjoying herself. At about 3am, she decided to leave and asked Daniel to take her home. Outside the bar, she found other boda boda riders who started pulling her aside but she told them off and left.When they reached Backyard Night Club, they were accosted by Maingi and another person who blocked them using a motorcycle. One of the men was armed with a knife.She said Maingi grabbed her wrist and twisted it. Daniel sensed danger and took off leaving her behind. Maingi and his accomplice sandwiched her on a motorcycle and took her to a house within Kajiado town. He was armed with a panga.He locked her in and left briefly. Maingi ’s accomplice came and told her to run away. She said she met Maingi near the door as she left the room.He forced her back and locked her in. He again left for about 20 minutes. When he came back, he asked her to undress but she refused.He started strangling her and pulled down her trousers. She pleaded with him to let her go to no avail. She then told him that if he must rape her he should use a condom. He put on a condom and proceeded to rape her.There was a sudden knock on the window. Maingi was asked to open the door. He got out and climbed onto the ceiling. The woman started shouting. The police broke the door and arrested Maingi.Doctor Yatib Abdi told the court that the complainant was reported to have been raped. On examination, she was in fair condition and appeared slightly drunk. The P3 form showed that she had a swelling on the left side of the forehead and tenderness on her wrists. Her clothes were dirty.The report showed that both labia manora and majora were lacerated, there was no hymen and there was clear discharge from her private parts.Maingi testified that he was chewing miraa at Makuyu Bar when the complainant walked. She appeared drunk. She sat near him. He started seducing her and bought her some wine.They enjoyed themselves up to 3am. She told him that if he was interested in her he would have to take her to his house. They left the bar at 4am for his house. They boarded a motorcycle and left. In the house, the woman told him that she would not have sex without a condom. He left to look for a condom and some cigarettes.He came back and they had sex till 6am. When he left the house to buy breakfast, he saw a police vehicle pass by. It stopped and police officers called him. They told him that he was suspected of selling stolen items and bhang and arrested him.He denied knowledge of the knife or hiding in the ceiling. He maintained that they had consensual sex."
108,"PSC faults centralised ICT procurement, seeks review","The Public Service Commission wants a review of the directive requiring all ICT equipment used by state agencies be procured from a central pool.ICT goods and services since July 2018 have been procured by the ICT Ministry headed by Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru.The move was intended to ensure standardisation of ICT equipment, avoid duplication of ICT projects and lower costs.All state agencies procuring computers – laptops and desktops, printers, servers and any other tech installations - are required to submit their plans for consolidation before purchase.Centralised procurement was to ensure economies of scale and shared service strategy to reduce operations costs.But the Public Service Commission says the arrangement has failed to address the discrepancies in the distribution of ICT support to civil servants.The commission, in its audit for the period ending June 2020, said only 57 institutions across the public service were issued with ICT equipment by the ministry.The PSC pointed out that the distribution of equipment appears to favour some institutions – citing the National Treasury – at the expense of others.In its report, the PSC said the National Treasury received 400 (47.4 per cent) of all the laptops and 834 (45.7 per cent) of all the desktop computers issued.It, therefore, wants public servants be facilitated with the requisite ICT resources for enhanced services.“The policy on centralisation of procurement of ICT equipment should be reviewed,” the PSC said in the report signed by chairman Stephen Kirogo.The commission wants the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua to ensure the matter is looked into by June.CS Mucheru, when contacted by the Star over the PSC  assertions, said reviews are normal in any system, “as was the case with schools’ curriculum and police uniforms"".“That said, we have had significant savings, standardisation and security for the government ICT systems as a result of centralised procurement,” Mucheru said.Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani, in a recent circular to ministries, state departments and agencies, said the order will remain in force for the next budget cycle – 2021-22 to 2023-24.Yatani said this was not limited to the purchase of computers, printers, and other ICT equipment; ICT networking and other communication equipment; purchase of software; contracted ICT professional services; and purchase of photocopiers.“MDAs will be required to justify the requirement they have submitted to the Ministry of ICT for such goods and related services,” the August 2020 circular read.(Edited by V.

109,Kenya to have surplus of 15 million bags of maize in February,"The maize balance sheet projected to end in February showed a surplus of about 15 million bags.Agriculture PS Hamadi Boga on Wednesday said this is based on about 300,000 bags imported by the private sector/millers. In addition to the ongoing long rains harvest and part of short rains harvest from the West of the Rift Valley harvests.Boga said the country is expecting 42 million bags of maize from this year's harvest. He spoke in an interview with the Star.  The food and nutrition report from the Ministry of Agriculture revealed a projected surplus of 5.8 million bags of beans by the end of February.“This is based on 200,000 bags estimated imports by the private sector and relief agencies and 3.4 million bags estimated harvests from the short rains by the end of February,” the report reads.The wheat balance sheet showed a surplus of 6.5 million bags as a result of local production supplemented by imports. Boga said the country relies on importation of about 70 per cent to sustain the two million bags consumed per month.The report further showed there will be a small surplus of 110,000 bags of rice-based on estimated imports by the private sector and relief agencies in addition to harvests from the long rains and main crop planted in July 2020—which is harvested in the November–December period.The PS said overall food commodity prices started declining with major harvesting taking place and increasing availability of staple commodities at the household level.“From the markets reported, a bag of maize was retailing at an average price of Sh2,625 per 90kg bag and below. Farmgate prices are ranging from Sh2,000 to Sh2,200 in the major maize-growing areas of the North Rift and western regions,” he said.The food security status report for January 2021 showed the dry spell of December 2020 ruined most food crops, especially in the Coast, Eastern and parts of Central.“Some crops such as beans and other pulses have been severely affected. In the first week of January 2021, several parts of Coast, Eastern and Central regions (that highly depend on the short rains) received some showers that have improved conditions of some food crops, especially maize, sorghum, millet and root crops,” Boga said."
110,We won't be drawn to Somalia's artificial fissures — Kenya,"Kenya will not be drawn into Somalia’s “reckless campaign to create artificial fissures for parochial and domestic political ends at the expense of regional peace and security”, the Foreign Affairs ministry has said.In a press release welcoming Igad's fact-finding mission report, the ministry on Wednesday said the findings prove the allegations by Somalia against Kenya were unfounded.“It is also clear that the decision by the Federal Government of Somalia to sever diplomatic relations with Kenya was uncalled for and has negatively impacted the lives of Somali nationals who seek relief and amenities in Kenya, AMISOM operations and the livelihoods of citizens of both countries.”“More importantly, it is now evident that the simulated crisis being contrived by Somalia does not advance Igad’s vision for achieving peace, prosperity and regional integration,” the statement said.But Somalia on Wednesday rejected the Igad report, saying it was ""biased, partisan, unfair, compromised and predetermined to exonerate Kenya.""""FGS regrets the partisanship portrayed by Djibouti and IGAD under the chairmanship of Ismail Guelleh. FGS strongly holds to all its initial accusations against Kenya and will pursue all means to protect her sovereignty,"" the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Wednesday.""It is instructive to note that the commission intentionally declined to visit Beled Xaawo on two occasions to witness Kenya's atrocities against Somalia"".Somalia called for the immediate withdrawal of the baseless and unfair report and demanded an apology.The Igad team formed by Djibouti President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh said in its report that it did not find Somalia’s grievances sufficient to justify a diplomatic separation between Kenya and Somalia.”Mogadishu severed diplomatic ties with Nairobi on November 30, accusing Kenya of interference in domestic affairs.It listed to the commission five grievances-violation of its airspace; violation of its land borders, that Kenyan forces, led by Amisom, leave their positions and move on to other locations; recognition and collaboration with Jubaland; participation in the illegal sugar and coal trade in Kismayu; and the creation, training and maintenance in Kenya of an armed group under the authority of Abdirashid Janan, the Jubaland security minister.Kenya denied all the accusations, but the commission found it culpable for violation of Somalia’s airspace.The commission further termed Somalia's move to sever ties as disproportionate and unproductive given the two countries are “intimately linked politically, humanely and economically”.“The consequences of this measure on the 3,000 Somali children attending Kenyan schools on the other side of the border, the hindrance to the functioning of Amisom, which has been experiencing difficulties in relief operations among Kenyan troops, and the economic impact of the embargo on khat in the agricultural region of Meru are a perfect illustration of this,” it said.The ministry said the fact-finding mission was accorded every assistance including a visit to the Kenya – Somali border to independently verify facts on the ground.“Kenya is confident that the Report of the Fact-Finding Mission provides clarity to the Assembly of IGAD Heads of State and Government who remain seized of this matter and would provide a way forward. Further, this impartial report definitively settles the matter,” the statement said.Kenya further challenged the administration of President Mohamed Farmaajo to honour the sacrifices it has made in the past and the will of the people by making a constructive contribution to regional peace, security and prosperity.This is even as Somalia continues to accuse Kenya of arming militias in Bula Hawo, the Gedo region, allegations Kenya has distanced itself from. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
111,Lobby wants more Pfizer Covid vaccine doses sent to Africa,"With large deliveries of Covid-19 vaccines to Africa expected to begin late next month, two pharmaceutical firms have been accused of giving the continent a raw deal.Doctors Without Borders, a health lobby with regional offices in Nairobi, says what Pfizer and BioNTech have offered Africa is just a 'pittance'.The two jointly have the most preferred vaccine with about 95 per cent efficacy.It is also the only joint vaccine to have received a World Health Organization emergency approval, so far.Last week, the two joined the Covax facility to send vaccines to poor countries but said they will offer only 40 million doses this year, or two per cent of their 2021 production.MSF said in a statement that rather than continuing to prioritise deals with high-income countries, Pfizer must make more doses available to the Covax facility.MSF said the development of the Pfizer vaccine was supported by a grant of nearly $443 million from the German government through its partner BioNTech, and a loan of over $118 million from the European Investment Bank.“Pharma is playing business-as-usual: the deal (with Covax) is only two per cent of Pfizer and BioNTech’s estimated total doses – a pittance, considering their production capacity and the bilateral deals they’ve already struck with high-income countries,” MSF said in a statement.At least 75 per cent of Pfizer’s vaccine doses have been secured by high-income countries, and of the more than 27.2 million doses delivered so far, high-income countries have received almost 27 million.Middle-income countries have only received close to 250,000 doses but low-income countries have received none.""Despite calls from several heads of state for global solidarity at the beginning of the pandemic, what we see today is a far cry from a picture of equity,"" said Dana Gill, US Policy Advisor on MSF Access Campaign.The earliest Kenya can receive the Covid-19 vaccine is the third week of February, according to projections given by Gavi. The vaccine alliance last week said the WHO must first grant the AstraZeneca vaccine emergency use listing, after reviewing its quality, safety, efficacy and performance data.Kenya has ordered 24 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for 20 per cent of the country’s population.However, Gavi said it will initially supply just a few doses to cover frontline workers and people with pre-existing health conditions.Gavi said it will next week indicate approximately how many doses each country will receive initially, to help them plan.“This indicative allocation will provide interim guidance to participants – offering a minimum planning scenario to enable preparations for the final allocation of the number of doses each participant will receive,” it said in a statement."
112,Tribunal orders company to pay KRA Sh9.3bn in tax dispute,"The Tax Appeals Tribunal has ordered Paleah Stores to pay Sh9.3 billion to Kenya Revenue Authority in a tax case.In a judgement delivered on January 22, the tribunal ruled that Paleah Stores owed KRA the money in tax arrears.The amount constitutes of Sh1,361,746,295 corporation tax and Sh7,891,387,842 in value added tax inclusive of interest and penalties.Paleah Stores had appealed to the tribunal in May 2017 contesting assessment and demand of the taxes by the KRA for the years of income between 2008 and 2014. The company admitted in its statement of facts that it was a victim of bad professional advice, leading to its accounts and tax returns not reflecting the correct position of its operations for the stated years.It, however, contested the tax assessments on the grounds that KRA did not consider its input tax claims, operational expenses and that the computation of the taxes was unfair. The tax assessments and demands arose out of an investigation and a tax audit carried out on Paleah Stores by KRA for the years of income between 2008 to 2014. Based on the company's appeal, the tribunal framed three issues for determination.The tribunal observed that Paleah Stores had not complied with its statutory obligations of keeping proper records for computing tax. This necessitated KRA to obtain information from third parties such as Paleah Stores’ suppliers and bankers.“In absence of complete records, the appellant and the respondent agreed to use the banking method to compute income for corporation tax, sales for output tax and purchases for input VAT,” Paleah said in its statement.The banking method revealed that the company had undeclared income tax and VAT which it failed to prove was excessive. “In the instant case, the appellant has not proved to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the respondent’s additional income tax assessments for 2008 to 2014 years of income were excessive. From the foregoing, the tribunal is of the considered view that the respondent did not err in law and fact by issuing additional income tax assessments on the appellant,” the tribunal held.Paleah Stores admitted that it did not keep proper VAT records. The company did not contest that it made its VAT claims outside the allowed statutory periods. Based on the computations, Paleah Stores's entire claim for input VAT was disallowed.The tribunal observed that the company failed to specify the exact nature of unfairness as alleged. KRA demonstrated all procedural requirements.The tribunal ruled that KRA adequately lived up to its mandate and did not act unfairly."
113,CoG warns counties to consider health deal cash implications,"The Council of Governors has warned county governments initiating the signing of the Return to Work Formula with healthcare workers to consider the monetary implications.Last week, the nurses’ union had hinted that it will be initiating the signing of the agreements at county level, adding that at least 10 counties had expressed interest in individually signing the deal in an effort to ensure normalcy in the health sector.In a letter to governors and copied to health CECs, public health CECs, all county secretaries, county public service boards and all chief officers for health, CoG chair Wycliffe Oparanya has warned that approval from SRC is mandatory and no allowance can be paid without their recommendation.“The purpose of this letter is to advise county governments to be cautions when executing the RTWF with the healthcare workers due to the monetary implication which requires approval of the SRC,” Oparanya said.He added: “The county governments are open to reinstate all healthcare workers participating in the ongoing strike and are willing to resume work based on the terms of agreement provided by the respective county governments.”Nurses, clinical officers and lab technologists have been on strike since December 7, with meetings scheduled to help unlock the stalemate proving abortive.The latest one was the meeting organized by the Labour CS Simon Chelugui on Monday failed to take place after the CoG and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services failed to send their representatives.The SRC on the other hand has become adamant, saying that it is the only body mandated to adjust pay for the health workers. This might complicate the situation further.The commission said any allowance can only be paid with its approval and the allowances captured in CBA can only be reviewed after the CBA’s lapse.But the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers SG George Gibore maintained that the strike will go despite numerous court injunctions and sacking threats from some counties.“What we want is they can at least be able to provide on how to give us those very crucial items we need like PPEs and subsequently anyone infected to get medication in a manner that is very clear rather than for us to go conducting harambees,” Gibore said.“The strike is still on, let’s hope that something will come up because there is no way we will go back. Since we went on strike we have not seen any health worker who has lost their life so this means we work in a very dangerous environment,” KUCO SG George Gibore said.The healthcare workers went on strike to demand for among other things, risk allowance for frontline healthcare workers, comprehensive medical insurance cover, hiring of more healthcare workers and provision of quality and standard personal protective equipment.The unions and the multi-agency committee arrived at a conclusion after the talks between both parties, but the Council of Governors has remained adamant saying they will not sign the document.“So if we are not protected, we cannot be guaranteed medication, and that once you lose your life your family can be compensated then I think the whole situation is very clear that when we are away from duty then we reduce the chances of being infected with covid-19,” Gibore added.He noted that the unions have received no further communication from the government after the Monday meeting failed to bear fruits."
114,Cervical cancer data headache as Kenyans shun hospitals due to Covid disruptions,"Change in health seeking behavior among Kenyans during the Covid-19 pandemic has made it difficult to get the latest statistics of new cervical cancer cases in the country.Experts have expressed concern that since the onset of the virus, most Kenyans have been shunning health facilities for fear of getting infected.January is cervical cancer awareness month.In Kenya, where HPV is the number one cause of cancer in women between the ages of 15 and 44, it is estimated that approximately 5,250 new cases are diagnosed annually.“Girls should come for the first pap smear as soon as it is discovered they are sexually active. Cervical cancer is not a death sentence, get hold of your life,” Consultant gynecologist at The Nairobi Hospital Prof Eunice Cheserem said.Cervical cancer is the leading cause of female cancer deaths in Kenya and is caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) that is easily preventable though vaccination.“Yeast infections do not cause cervical cancer. However, frequent infections pause a risk because they mean less protection,” Consultant gynecologist at The Nairobi Hospital Dr Koigi Kamau said.Kenya introduced the HPV vaccine in the country in October 2019 targeting 800,000 girls to protect them against the cancer causing virus.The vaccines, provided through support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance aim to reach all girls aged 10 in two doses administered six months apart.But with the Covid disruptions, the country has managed to reach slightly above 360,000 girls.According to GAVI, the vaccine alliance, effective implementation and introduction of new vaccines into routine immunisation programmes requires collaboration to raise awareness and generate demand.“Mothers, grandmothers, daughters, wives – too many women’s lives in the poorest countries are cut short by the scourge of cervical cancer, and the greatest tragedy is that the vast majority of cases are entirely preventable via routine immunisation with HPV vaccine,” Gavi CEO Dr Seth Berkley said.Head of Immunisation Programmes Dr Collins Tabu told the Star that the virus containment measures put in place has contributed to the attainment of low numbers than had been anticipated.“It is largely because much as the vaccine is being offered in every health facility, the other aspect is that the targeted outreaches for the vaccine were to be conducted jointly with schools but schools were closed due to the pandemic,” Tabu said.Cervical cancer ranks fourth globally in both incidence and cancer related mortality among women.In Kenya, cancer of the cervix is the second most common kind of cancer in women aged 15 to 44 years after breast cancer.It kills nine women every day, about 3,000 every year, a lethalness only second to breast cancer."
115,Lobby opposes amendment to Alcoholic Drinks Control Act,"The Alcoholic Beverages Association of Kenya has opposed any amendment to the Alcoholic Drinks Control Act of 2010.The association said the amendment through a private member’s Bill by Wundanyi MP Danson Mwakuwona is an ""outrageous, retrogressive proposal that has no place in the country"".The association while making its submissions to the Committee on Administration and National Security, said the National Assembly should reject the Bill altogether. Mwakuwona's bill proposes to limit the packaging of alcoholic products in containers of 750 milliliters or more, guided by the rationale that this would reduce the misuse of alcohol.The Bill also proposes that consumers be forced to pay a cash deposit whenever they intend to purchase alcoholic drinks packed in glass containers.But ABAK chairman Gordon Mutugi said the proposed law is discriminatory to the majority of the alcohol beverage consumers who cannot afford alcohol packaged in 750ml containers, which sells at higher prices and are therefore inaccessible to those who currently buy in smaller containers.He said legally prescribing that consumers buy more than they can consume is not only encouraging irresponsible drinking but is also counterproductive in the fight against illicit alcohol consumption due to unaffordability which the government has been combating for many years.""Elimination of the option to sell alcohol packed in smaller packages would undoubtedly force those who cannot afford quality alcoholic beverages sold in larger packaging to seek illicit and unhealthy alternatives, such as the purchase of alcohol in bulk and sharing it into smaller containers, or consuming contraband alcohol from neighbouring countries,"" he said.Mutugi said the 2010 act already has mechanisms in place to prevent underage access to alcoholic beverages.To him, enforcement of the existing law is essential to ensure there is no alcohol sold or served to minors.""Both alcohol and glass manufacturers have made significant investments in 250ml, 300ml, 440ml and 500ml packaging. These investments will be rendered untenable if the Bill is passed, with billions of shillings at risk, and the knock-on effect will be on employment in both the glass manufacturing and alcohol making and packaging sectors,"" Mutugi said.In a statement to newsrooms, Mutugi said there will be huge cost implications for manufacturers in rejigging production lines (taking many years) meaning direct job losses in manufacturing, one of Kenya’s economic growth pillars.Mutugi argued that the imposition of a deposit requirement on glass containers will force manufacturers to pack alcoholic beverages in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. This packaging he said has an extremely negative impact on the environment and human health since the material is non-biodegradable.""Forcing the industry to use PETs will undermine all the gallant efforts that have gone into the recycling of PETs,"" he said.He added, ""Alcohol manufacturers have mechanisms to collect returnable glass from the market. Requesting for deposit on the same unduly burdens manufacturers with unnecessarily duplicative financial and administrative processes"".Mutugi also said the glass disposal industry has created a significant value chain where glass manufacturers collect, crash, and recycle cullet (glass prepared for remelting).""This Bill now puts these jobs at great risk and passing this piece of law would mean loss of thousands of value chain jobs in production, distribution, and sale of alcoholic products in Kenya,"" Mutugi said.He said the Bill is an unfortunate effort which, if passed into law, will cripple an industry already reeling from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.""The Bill will also not yield the claimed benefits of safeguarding underage drinking or addressing the intended environmental consequences, which are being addressed by ABAK and other manufacturers in Kenya,"" he said."
116,Mwilu asks for prayers as JSC embarks on hiring new CJ,"Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu on Wednesday asked Kenyans to pray ahead of the planned hiring of a new CJ to ensure selfish interests do not take the centre stage in the process.“All we need are your prayers. As I said myself, the exercise we are embarking on is not different from what we have done previously and I pray that the Lord God will remain in us and keep us guided on the right path so that we know that we don’t exist for ourselves but for the Judiciary and the people of Kenya,” Mwilu said.She was speaking at the Supreme Court after the swearing-in of Evelyne Olwande as a member of the Judicial Service Commission.Olwande was recently elected by magistrates to replace Emily Ominde as their representative on the JSC. The commission is set to recruit a new Chief Justice to take over from David Maraga who retired two weeks ago.However, Mwilu said even though it is a serious assignment, it is not a difficult task compared to any other work they do as a commission.“You join the commission at a time that is not special or more difficult than any other time, the work of a commissioner is sacred at all times,” Mwilu told Olwande.Mwilu welcomed the magistrate to the JSC and reminded her that her membership was to serve the interest of the Judiciary.  “You don’t come to serve the purpose of 200 people who voted you in, you are to serve the interest of the Judiciary to ensure that its independence is maintained and to serve the people of Kenya who pay your salary,” Mwilu said.Olwande beat Stella Atambo, Florence Macharia, Dolphina Alego and Teresia Nyangena to represent the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association in the JSC. In her speech, Olwande urged fellow commissioners to put the interest of Kenyans first in discharging their mandate, especially in the hiring of a new CJ.“Kenyans are looking at us with bated breath and hopeful eyes. It is my prayer that when we discharge our mandate, the best interest of Kenyans shall be our potions,” she said.She promised to serve to the best of her ability and play her role to ensure there is a good relationship between the three arms of government.She promised fellow magistrates and judges that she will begin working on achieving the pledges she made during her campaigns.“I promise to prioritise issues that affect us such as the security of judicial officers, remuneration, career progress and disciplinary process,” she said.Speaking to the Star after the swearing-in ceremony, KMJA secretary-general Derrick Kutto said they have a lot of confidence in Olwande.“Given her track record in the association, we are confident that she will achieve what she set out to do in her manifesto,” Kutto said.Other members of the JSC include Mwilu, Mohamed Warsame, Olive Mugenda, Felix Koskei, Patrick Gichohi, Attorney General Paul Kihara, Macharia Njeru, Mercy Deche, David Majanja and Judiciary chief registrar Anne Amadi who is the secretary of the commission. Edited by P.O"

127,Kenya sucked into Israel-Iran hostilities over Iranian VP visit on Holocaust day,"Kenya has been sucked into the diplomatic hostilities between Iran and Israel over a visit by Iranian Iranian Vice President for Science and Technology Sorena Sattari.Sattari is leading a delegation of over 30 Iranian high-tech companies for bilateral talks with their Kenyan counterparts. He  was received on Tuesday by Foreign Affairs CAS Ababu Namwamba. But the Embassy of Israel has protested the visit, noting that it is happening on the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is marked on January 27.In a protest letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Israel said it was displeased that the Vice President of Iran will visit the country on the day, while “the same regime leads the Holocaust denial, while calling for the destruction of the State of Israel”.The day commemorates the 1941-45 genocide in World War II, which resulted in the deaths of six million Jews and 11 million others by the Nazi regime and its collaborators.Iran's position on the Holocaust has been controversial. For Instance, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  frequently claimed the Holocaust was a myth during his presidency 2005-2013. In the protest letter, Israel said: “The Embassy notes that the Islamic Republic of Iran is an authoritarian, theocratic regime that strictly imposes Sharia Law in Iran and has been working to obtain nuclear weapons capabilities for over 20 years. The regime has become a force for destabilization and insurgency across the Middle East and Africa”.“The Embassy therefore urges that Kenya, as an important international player, a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a bold friends of Israel, utilizes its position to support efforts to diminish the dangers that Iran poses on the global security and stability”.The mission also asked Kenya to express to the Iranian Vice President concerns over the threat the country “poses on world peace, its Holocaust denial and its alarming destabilizing role in the Middle East, Africa and other parts of the world”.Attempts to get a comment from Iran embassy on the matter were futile.The Iranian delegation is set to meet Kenya business community to strengthen trade relations between the two states. In a statement on January 19, Iran embassy said the business trip will be aimed at enhancing economic interaction between the private sectors of the two countries in the area of high technologies.In its efforts to increase trade ties with Kenya, Iran has established the Iran House of Innovation and Technology in Kilimani in Nairobi that will provide a platform for exchange of ideas.The delegation of the Iranian knowledge-based firms in the fields of petrochemical, renewable energy, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and nanotechnology will tour the hub on Wednesday.It is not the first time the Iran leader is visiting.In October 2018, Sattari led a high-ranking delegation comprised of officials and heads of 45 knowledge-based companies to Kenya and Uganda for another business visit.The Iranian government at the time said the tour was in line with export development and international business programmes for knowledge-based enterprises, “as part of the activities of Iran’s Science and Technology Vice-Presidency in support of these companies”.In May 2012, Iran's Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi visited Kenya to complete a deal for Kenya to buy Iranian oil, but the agreement fell through as Kenya acted on warnings by Western states of sanctions."
128,"Murder suspect cornered by police, threatens to commit suicide","DCI sleuths have cornered a murder suspect believed to have killed his ex-girlfriend in Njiru last Friday.The suspect is said to have tied her ex-lover up inside her house before setting it on fire.On Wednesday, the detectives cornered him inside his house on the fifth floor of an apartment in Kayole.He is currently at the balcony, threatening to commit suicide.Officers are at the scene pleading with him not to take his life on account of his actions.After spending hours convincing the suspect not to commit suicide, the police managed to arrest him, and is in police custody.The police had a rough time evacuating the suspect from the scene, which was blocked by hundreds of residents baying for his blood.According to the report filed by the two househelps of the deceased, the lady asked them for privacy upon receiving the visitor, who happened to be the ex-lover.Later on in the afternoon, the house was seen in flames, and even after efforts to put out the fire, nothing was salvaged, not even the deceased"
129,"Mwananchi Credit unveils 8-year repayment plan for civil servants, teachers","Mwananchi Credit Limited has announced an extended repayment period of eight years for loans taken by civil servants and Teachers Service Commission (TSC) members. The lender said that this is part of efforts to ease the financial burden on this group of borrowers as Covid-19 continues to adversely affect people’s finances.Civil servants and teachers registered by TSC will now have up to 96 months (eight years) to pay their loans, a major relief from the previous six years (72 months).Mwananchi Credit Executive Director Dennis Mombo said that civil servants’ investment has been responsible for the development of most satellite towns in Kenya. “Civil servants have been the backbone of the nation for decades, contributing to some of the most critical economic sectors,” Mombo said.Mombo added that the lender was exploring more ways to provide relief to its clients, including salary check-off loan buffs from other financial institutions.He said the longer repayment period would make civil servants more resilient to coronavirus related economic disruptions.“Civil servants are vital economic engines in the country, and they have helped make our economy strong. We will continue to provide every business and individual with the most effective response possible during these times of uncertainty.”Mwananchi Credit, which was recently recognized as the most preferred institution in logbook financing for the year 2020, has tailor-made the salary check-off product for civil servants to enable them to invest in various businesses.The salary check-off loans are available to all civil servants from across the country working in healthcare, education, county governments, and defence forces among others.No security is required as these loans are given against salaries. Civil servants are eligible to a minimum loan of Sh3,000 and maximum of Sh2 million depending on the salary scale.To cushion its customers further, Mombo says Mwananchi Credit has cut interest rates on its various loan facilities to as low as 1.5 per cent. This makes it the lender with the lowest interest rate and longest repayment period in the market."
130,Auditor General on the spot over Kemsa audit 'typing error',"The auditor general has revised the audit query of a company linked to the Kemsa scandal saying the unexplained amount was Sh34.9 million instead of the reported Sh340.9 million.The office is on the spot amid questions by MPs at the National Assembly’s Public Investments Committee on how the auditor commissioned the error.OAG had stated that Nanopay faced the multi-million shilling query but its officials on Tuesday informed the Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir-led committee of the change.The officers said the figure involving supplies of Covid-19 emergency response kits to Kemsa was changed by an unknown person.Nanopay was earlier reported to have supplied 50,000 pieces of facemasks at Sh340 million but the figure has now been reduced to Sh34 million.MPs were also informed that the query involving Shop N Buy – another firm implicated in the Covid19 supplies scandal, was also changed but the officers could not state the amount.An officer cited a typing error adding that the correct figure was Sh34 million.The company’s directors were set to appear before the committee to answer to the queries but none turned up.Auditor General Nancy Gathungu informed Parliament of the error in an addendum to the Special Audit Report on the utilization of Covid-19 funds.“We wish to clarify an error occurring in pages 18 and 41 of the special report on the amount of Nanopay,” the auditor said.MPs at the committee cast aspersions on the corrections and the explanation the same as a result of a typing error.MP Nassir asked the Auditor General to furnish the committee with a report on the said errors as soon as possible.Lawmakers at the committee questioned how an audit report which passes through many hands can end up with erratic findings.Likoni MP Mishi Mboko, her Ganze counterpart Teddy Mwambire, Ruaraka’s Tom Kajwang’ spoke of the matter citing their concerns with the increasing cases of errors in public records.Mwambire said: “The committee should get to the bottom of the matter when the witness appears before us in person.”Kajwang’ said the committee will consider reconciling the figures with the directors of the two firms when they come.MPs further took issue with directors of Nanopay and Shop N Buy having failed to appear before the committee a second time.Nairobi MP Esther Passaris reprimanded the suppliers for treating the committee with contempt after one of the companies – Nanopay - sent a letter of apology to the team."
131,"Moderna vaccine not for pregnant women, WHO warns","The World Health organisation has warned that pregnant women should not be injected with the Moderna vaccine.No vaccine trials have included pregnant women - and they are not expected to until after the first quarter of 2021, the WHO says.""While pregnancy puts women at a higher risk of severe Covid-19, the use of this vaccine in pregnant women is currently not recommended, unless they are at risk of high exposure,"" WHO said in a statement on Tuesday.Director of Immunization Kate O'Brien stressed that clinical trials of the Moderna vaccine are needed on pregnant women.""There is no reason to think there could be a problem in pregnancy, we are just acknowledging the data is not there at the moment,"" she said.WHO also noted that individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not take the vaccine or any other mRNA vaccine.The vaccine should not be administered to persons younger than 18 years of age pending the results of further studies.On Monday, Moderna Inc said its vaccine produced virus-neutralizing antibodies in laboratory tests against new coronavirus variants found in the UK and South Africa.A two-dose regimen of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine is expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date, the company said.Moderna, however, said it would test a vaccine booster against the South Africa variant in pre-clinical trials to see if that would be more effective in boosting antibodies against the variant and other future variants.Although all viruses mutate constantly, scientists are concerned about the mutations discovered in Britain and South Africa because they are believed to be capable of altering key functions of the virus. Last month, Unicef announced details of a mammoth operation to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to Kenya and other developing countries.The agency says it has contracted more than 350 airlines and freight companies to deliver one billion syringes and the vaccines.At least 500 million syringes will be delivered ahead of the vaccines next year.  The announcement came as more research centres, including the University of Oxford, announced promising results of vaccine trials."
132,Lake Nakuru tilapia poisoned by sewage - Kemfri,"Tilapia and other fish from Lake Nakuru are poisonous and unfit for human consumption.That's what the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (Kemfri) declared on Tuesday.Barely three months after fishing in the lake started, the research institute said consumption of Nakuru fish will have serious health effects on consumers. Fishing has been declared illegal.The Ministry of Agriculture has directed the Nakuru county government  to conduct studies following reports that the fish started rotting three hours after they were caught.For years, sewage and industrial waste has been flowing into the lake.Agriculture CAS Linah Kilimo said heavy pollution could have caused the crisis.She said the ministry had received the reports on contamination from the research institute and said the responsibility now lies with the county government.“The report from Kemfri confirms that fish from Lake Nakuru is unfit for human consumption and it may cause diseases in the future,” she said.Kilimo was speaking after leading a restocking of Lake Naivasha with more than 100,000 fingerlings donated by the ministry.During the exercise, illegal, small-mesh nets were burnt. Overfishing, illegal fishing and water hyacinths are major concerns, she said, as well as human activities too close to the lake.“During Covid-19 pandemic, many people lost their jobs and they turned to the lake leading to an increase in illegal fishing which has adversely affected the fisheries sector,” she said.The CAS noted that the government was keen to second the Kenya Coast Guards to the lake to stop illegal fishing, seize unsafe boats and stop smuggling.“Over 15 people have lost their lives while illegally fishing in the lake and it's time that we stopped these illegal cases by increasing patrols,” she said.The CAS added that the government was keen to support the fisheries sector that employs thousands of people.Nakuru's CEC for Agriculture Immaculate Maina termed Lake Naivasha a critical water body where 250 tonnes of fish were caught last year.She said the county made over Sh300 million from fish last year, hoping it will increase to Sh1 billion this year, despite illegal fishing. “We have already restocked Lake Solai and all fishing ponds in the county with fingerlings as one way of increasing fish production and revenue,” she said.(Edited by V.

133,Mother sues prestigious school for punishing son over fight,"A parent has sued a prestigious international school, seeking orders compelling the institution to readmit her son.The mother who cannot be named for legal reasons says that her son was sent away from school for allegedly getting into a fight, without any evidence to support the claim.Even though the school allegedly did not take any action against her son's earlier complaint about being sexually harassed by other students, she said, they sent him home without any evidence of him getting into a fight. The sexual harassment complaint was not related to the fighting incident.She believes that the decision is discriminatory.It all began when sometime this month she was summoned to the school and informed that her son had broken school rules.However, she says, she was not given an audience by the school director and asked to meet with the deputy principal.It was alleged that her son engaged in a fight but she was not given any evidence.And as a result of the fight, she says, the school put her son in solitary confinement, away from the rest of the students.""...Denying him the opportunity to study and interact with his peers was a discriminatory action by the respondent (school),"" the mother said in her suit papers.And as a result of the exclusion his right to attend his school of choice and continue his school activities had been infringed, the court was told.The mother revealed that when she inquired from the child on the veracity of the allegations she learned that he had been bullied and sexually harassed by students. It was also revealed that the school, despite receiving complaints from the student, did not take any action.The mother also told the court that her child had received threats both verbally and on social media platforms from other students in regard to the alleged incident as well as parents of the alleged perpetrators.She expressed her disappointment at how she had been treated by the school and how unjustly her son was treated.""Petitioner is deeply disturbed by the callous manner in which her child was treated and humiliated by being forced to leave school without any tangible reasons,"" the suit says.She accused the school of unjustly enriching itself with fees her son paid even while he was out.""I continue to suffer emotionally as my son is out of school lagging behind as his classmates progress and this will prejudice his education,"" she says."
134,Somalia's protests no justification to sever ties with Kenya — Igad,"Somalia’s grievances against Kenya were no justification to sever diplomatic relations, an Igad fact-finding commission has said.In an apparent indictment of Somalia, the Igad team says in its report: ""The commission considers that these grievances, some of them long-standing, do not appear sufficient to justify a diplomatic separation between Kenya and Somalia.”The committee formed on December 22 after the 38th Igad Summit in Djibouti further termed Somalia's move as disproportionate and unproductive given the two countries are “intimately linked politically, humanely and economically”.“The consequences of this measure on the 3,000 Somali children attending Kenyan schools on the other side of the border, the hindrance to the functioning of Amisom, which has been experiencing difficulties in relief operations among Kenyan troops, and the economic impact of the embargo on khat in the agricultural region of Meru are a perfect illustration of this,” it said.The team made up of diplomats, military officers and an Igad representative recommended diplomatic efforts at the highest level to reconcile the two states.Asked about Kenya's reaction to the report, Foreign Affairs PS Macharia Kamau said they are still digesting it and would give an official position later. Kamau, however, said given it is not Kenya that broke the relations, the responsibility falls on Somalia.Prof Peter Kagwanja, a governance policy analyst, told the Star Somalia was in the wrong from the onset and regional leaders told him so during the Igad summit. He said Somalia tries to use Kenya for its own domestic issues, noting that President Mohamed Farmaajo is facing a difficult election.“With the electoral crisis in Somalia, Farmaajo was trying to use the diplomatic shutdown to make a headway,” Kagwanja said on Tuesday.Mogadishu severed diplomatic ties with Nairobi on November 30, accusing Kenya of interference in domestic affairs. It listed to the commission five grievances—violation of its airspace; violation of its land borders, that Kenyan forces, led by Amisom, leave their positions and move on to other locations; recognition and collaboration with Jubaland; participation in the illegal sugar and coal trade in Kismayu; and the creation, training and maintenance in Kenya of an armed group under the authority of Abdirashid Janan, the Jubaland security minister.Kenya denied all the accusations, but the commission found it culpable for violation of Somalia’s airspace.""The commission considers that there is sufficient evidence that Kenyan aircraft entered the Somali territory in disregard of the provisions of the Convention on Civil Aviation signed in Chicago on December 7, 1944.“In disagreement with the local authorities in Jubaland, the federal government had instructed all aircraft to land in Mogadishu. Kenyan planes braved the ban to defeat a total air embargo that provides no exemptions for any reason, including humanitarian evacuations,” the team said.The commission, however, found no evidence on the other accusations, including recognition and collaboration with Jubaland. It said the participation of Garissa Township MP Aden Duale and Senator Yusuf Haji in the enthronement of Jubaland leader Ahmed Madobe did not amount to recognition.“However, no one can contest the proximity of the Kenyan government to the regional authorities to preserve security on their soil in a region infested by terrorists. Kenya has made great human sacrifices to free this region from the shebabs (al Shabaab) to protect itself from many attacks that have been perpetrated on its soil,” the report says.Prof Kagwanja said Kenya has been a victim of Farmaajo’s attempt to rig the election by attempting to split votes in Gedo and Kismayu and should keep off to avoid being “used like Ethiopia in 2016”.“Farmaajo knows that if he reinstates relations, he loses the election,” Kagwanja said.But even with calls to dialogue, Somalia Information Minister Osman Abukar Dubbe accused Kenya of arming and backing rebels (Jubaland soldiers) who attacked Beled Hawo town in Gedo early Monday.But Kenya distanced itself from the attack and wrote to AU chairman Moussa Faki expressing concerns about renewed fights between Somali Army and Jubaland forces in the border town. Kenya said the clashes would trigger displacement and generate a high number of refugees.In response, Faki urged the two states to exercise restraint and engage in dialogue in conformity with the IGAD-led process.“Peace on the Kenya-Somalia border is vital to regional stability,” Faki said on Tuesday.On the other hand, Mogadishu lifted a ban imposed on the sale of miraa from Kenya but said traders must apply for import licences."
135,"Uhuru, Raila in epic battle against Ruto as IEBC clears BBI bill","President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are set for a gruelling battle with Deputy President William Ruto after IEBC cleared the Building Bridges Initiative Bill.The IEBC on Tuesday sent the Bill to all the 47 county assemblies after it cleared 1,140,845 signatures of registered voters in support of the drive.The figure surpassed the one million constitutional threshold required to send the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 to the county assemblies for consideration.“This is therefore to notify you that the initiative has met the requisite threshold as provided in Article 257 (4) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010,” IBEC chairman Wafula Chebukati said in a letter to the speakers of all the 47 county assemblies.The BBI secretariat co-chaired by Suna East MP Junet Mohammed and former Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru had submitted 4.4 million signatures to the commission for verification last December.However, the commission said it digitised 1,715,386 signatures out of which 1,140,845 were verified.The remaining signatures shall be verified and the final report shared with the public, Chebukati said.With the notice of approval, Chebukati has set the stage for an epic battle pitting the handshake partners – Uhuru and Raila against the DP in the regional assemblies.The assemblies will be the new battlegrounds as the antagonists will seek to outdo each other and sway the MCAs to vote in their favour.Article 257 (6) requires the assemblies to consider – debate and vote to approve or reject – the Bill and submit their decision to the speakers of the bicameral Parliament within three months of receipt of notice by the commission.According to a roadmap issued by the BBI secretariat last year, the country should go to the referendum by June if all goes as per the plan.Uhuru and Raila are marketing the drive as a lifetime opportunity to fix problems that have bedevilled the country, including election violence.However, Ruto and his allies have discredited it as one meant to create positions for a few ‘dynasties’ at the expense of the ‘hustlers’ – ordinary wananchi.The BBI introduces the positions of a Prime Minister and two deputies as well as that of Official Opposition Leader in Parliament.It also increases allocation to counties from the current 15 per cent to 35 per cent, creates a ward development fund and establishes a Judiciary ombudsman.While the BBI proponents say the positions will end the winner-takes-all elections and eradicate post –election chaos, opponents argue the seat will not benefit mwananchi who is struggling to put food on the table.The DP has launched massive campaigns against the drive and intensified meetings with MCAs from various assemblies to persuade them to reject the document.Last week, he met MCAs from Kajiado and Mandera as well as senators and members of the National Assembly at his Karen residence.His handlers disclosed that more meetings are lined up this week with MCAs from Murang'a, Nyeri and Kirinyaga expected to visit him.Raila, who has emerged as the face of BBI referendum push, has been traversing the country, especially the capital, Nairobi, marketing the document as one that will resolve many of Kenyans' problems."
136,"Kikuyu, Kalenjins grossly overrepresented in civil service","Kikuyus and Kalenjins are grossly overrepresented in the civil service, the Public Service Commission has revealed in the latest jobs audit.Mijikenda, Turkana, Somalis and Luhya were among ethnic groups found to be underrepresented going by their percentages of the 2019 Census.By the end of June 2020, there were 45,291 Kikuyus, 21 per cent of the public service. The PSC revealed there were 35,991 Kalenjins, making up 16.7 per cent of the 214,606 civil servants.Luos are third, with 25,382 holding public jobs, while Luhyas are fourth with 25,382 in the public service. Some 16,167 Kisiis hold government jobs, meaning they are also overrepresented. Somalis hold 5,052 posts—which is 2.35 per cent.The Constitution requires state offices to factor in the balance of gender, ethnicity, persons with disabilities, minorities and the marginalised.A number of state agencies have yet to live up to the December 2015 Public Service Commission diversity policy for ministries, departments and agencies. It provided that ethnic groups whose job representation surpasses their percentage of the population are considered overrepresented.The Dahalo and Wayyu—largely occupying the mouth of the Tana River—have no representation in the civil service.A number of communities have normal representation. They include Suba, Swahili, Teso, Tharaka, Samburu, Sakuye, Rendile, Orma, Meru, Mbeere, Maasai, Makonde, Kuria, Embu, Gabra, El Molo, Dorobo, Borana, Burji, Bajuni, Kamba, Ilchalmus, Nubi and Pokomo.Ethnicity is a matter of debate ahead of the 2022 general election amid calls for the Kikuyu and Kalenjin to let a person from another community take up the reins from President Uhuru Kenya.In terms of staffing levels, nine public institutions, among them the scandal-ridden Kenya Medical Supplies Authority, are overstaffed—some by over 200 per cent of their supposed establishment.Kemsa has 555 employees in excess of its authorised establishment.The Vocational and Technical Training department has an excess of 893 staffers, whereas Moi University has 815 workers it doesn’t need.Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) has 45 in excess; 37 at the Kenya Post Office Savings Bank; 12 at the Tourism department; 16 at Kenya Seed Company; six at the Ombudsman; and one at the Wildlife Department.Moi University, KCAA, Kemsa, and Posta Kenya were also found to be over-established during the 2018-19 evaluation cycle.The latest report dated December 2020 showed that a number of state agencies are non-compliant with the law. It revealed that fewer women hold positions at management and policy levels, much as the gender threshold has been met.PSC chair Stephen Kirogo said there was a need to scale up efforts to improve public service’s compliance with the law.“For instance, a marginal increase of 0.1 per cent in the representation of PWDs was recorded in 2019-20 compared to the 2018-19 evaluation cycle.“Clearly, a lot still has to be done to meet the constitutional threshold of five per cent,” he said.In what may defeat efforts by President Kenyatta to fight corruption in the public service, only 684 officers of the 10,793 appointed in the period made their initial declarations.“Out of the 9,392 officers who exited the service, only 1,065 officers made their final declarations,” the report reads.PSC concluded that this was an indication that many of the officers who joined or exited the service did not file their declarations as required by the Public Officers Ethics Act, 2003.The audit further revealed that public officers were receiving monetary or non-monetary gifts valued at more than Sh20,000 contrary to the Leadership and Integrity Regulations Act, 2015.Of the 291 public agencies, only 68 had officers declare gifts they received during the period.Only three commissions and independent offices of the 10 had their staff declare gifts, the same being the case of ministries and state departments where only four of 49 had declarations.At least 14 of 35 universities had their staffers declare gifts; 47 of the 190 semi-autonomous government agencies and none at the statutory commissions.State agencies were also found to be lacking conflict of interest registers as required by the Leadership and Integrity Act, 2012.Of the 291 agencies evaluated, 253 did not have a conflict of interest declared, while 45 have not maintained conflict of interest registers.At the same time, very few institutions had developed guidelines to facilitate structured public participation and access to information during the review period.PSC also found out that not all institutions ensured their officers set performance targets, posing adverse consequences on performance management.“It was also noted that performance contracting has not been entrenched into any legislation despite the government having adopted it way back in 2004,” the report reads.Public universities, however, emerged the best performing, while ministries and state departments performed the least.At the same time, staff shortages continued to accost a number of public institutions as only 64 per cent of posts are filled.Of the 336,074 available positions, at least 120,214 – representing 36 per cent of the authorised establishment, are vacant.Ministries and state departments have shortages of 55,588 staff whereas State Corporations are yet to fill 47,574 posts for optimum operations.Public Universities have a variance of 11,428 staffers; 3,896 for constitutional commissions and independent offices; and 1,467 for statutory commissions and authorities.“The vacant posts have been occasioned by the recruitment moratorium, re-organization and restructuring of government institutions and reviewing of the staff establishment,” PSC said.The audit further revealed that a total of 789 officers were serving beyond the retirement age of 60 years – or 65 years for persons with disabilities.State agencies were also found to be in breach of the rule of secondment of staff which sets a three-year timeframe.PSC has directed a recall of the civil servants who have overstayed in the institutions that were found non-compliant to the provision.The evaluation further revealed that most institutions are not creating awareness of their services among citizens, the number increasing by the day.Many state agencies are also still having as many as 2,282 officers serving in acting appointments, of which 1,435 have served for more than six months.The audit showed that 17 institutions were operating without functional boards of directors or councils.PSC said, “this impacts service delivery because the institutions lack a body to provide leadership and strategic direction.”The affected are AFFA; National Biosafety Authority; National Communication Secretariat; CEMASTEA; Kenya Law Reform Commission; KNCHR; Athi Water Works Development Agency; EPRA.Others are ICT Authority; Kenya National Library Service; Lake Victoria South Water Works Development Agency; Local Authorities Provident Fund; National Council for Children’s Services; National Youth Council; NGO Coordination Board; Privatization Commission, and Vision 2030 Delivery Secretariat.In state agencies, over 44 per cent were equally found operating without workers signing performance contracts.PSC said the failure to sign a performance contract does not augur well in terms of promoting transparency and accountability."
137,From convicting accused persons as magistrate to being a lawyer,"He is the magistrate who went viral for ruling that drunk driving is not a crime, but months later, he left the Judiciary amid allegations that he took a bribe from former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu.Lawyer Bryan Khaemba, a former magistrate, sat down with the Star for his first-ever interview since the Waititu saga two years ago.Khaemba says he was born and raised in a small village in Bungoma county. The fourth born in a family of six, he endured hardship and is the only one in formal employment.“My mother was selling porridge in a market called Kapkateny in Mt Elgon. She was supplying porridge to the other market operators every Thursday and Saturday. Out of the income of that business is where we were earning our livelihood,” Khaemba said.He went to a day school, which was seven kilometers away. He had a chance to join Friends School Kamusinga but missed out due to financial constraints.Khaemba would walk to school every day even though it was far in a bid to quench his thirst for learning. But a year later, he moved to stay with his grandmother in order to go to a day school near her home.He passed his KCSE exam despite school fees difficulties and surprised everyone by emerging position 85 in the whole nation.He joined the University of Nairobi to study law, and that was his first time to come to the city that he would read about and see on TV.CAREER PROGRESSIONOn what inspired him to study law, Khaemba says he admired how Siaya Senator James Orengo and his Makueni counterpart the late Mutula Kilonzo argued their cases in court. So he decided to pursue law and luckily, he passed his exams and got admission.After graduation, he joined the Kenya School Law and at the same time got work at the law firm of now Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi as a pupil.Even before he was admitted to the bar in 2007, he got a job at the Immigration office as a prosecutor at the investigations department. He was admitted to the bar a year later in 2008.In 2010, the Judiciary advertised for a position of district magistrate. He applied and was hired.He was posted to Kigumo law courts, where he served until 2015, when he got a transfer to the Kibera law courts“I was transferred to Nairobi because I had been elected as secretary general for KMJA and my office was in Milimani,” he said.He served at KMJA for two terms and later vied at the East African Magistrates and Judges Association and was elected.“It’s for all judicial officers in East Africa. I served for one term of two years,” Khaemba says.THE WAITITU SCANDALIn 2019, Khaemba was thrown into the headlines for the wrong reasons after it was alleged that he received a bribe to rule in favour of Waititu.The former magistrate has dismissed the allegations, saying he never received any bribe and the media was not covering the correct position of events as they happened at that time.“I could not defend myself at that time because as a judicial officer, you cannot call a press conference to counter what is being said in the media or clarify,” Khaemba says.He says even the employment court agreed with him and ruled there was nothing wrong with him granting anticipatory bail to an applicant.“Contrary to what was being said to the public, I was never a sick man. What came out to the media, it appeared like I was in an ICU bed then Waititu called me and said, 'Come and help me', and I told the doctor to put me in an ambulance to go and sort out someone in court,” he says.Khaemba says on that day, he called the head of station and told her he would report to work late and, since he was on transfer to Thika, then he would just be in chambers, writing judgments.While in his chambers, he was approached by the head of criminal registry, who informed him that he was the only magistrate who was not sitting in court and should handle a certificate of urgency that had been filed by a lawyer who was impatient.“The head of the criminal registry came with a handwritten note from the duty magistrate, saying, 'If you are not in court, I'm told there is an advocate out there who has become impatient and I can’t leave court to attend to certificate, handle it so that we don’t embarrass the station',” he says.Khaemba proceeded to attend to the case, which turned out to be Waititu's, granting anticipatory bail. This sparked an uproar and the then CJ David Maraga sent him on unpaid leave for alleged abuse of office.However, Khaemba sued the CJ for interfering with his work, and the court ordered that he be reinstated and posted to a new station.Khaemba did not expect that the Waititu matter would be out in the news to that magnitude, even after he had given a chronology of events leading to his decision.“As it continued, I got used to it because I have gone through some serious training when I was at Immigration, which has made my body and mind ready to face any challenge,” he said.Though he left the Judiciary shortly afterwards, Khaemba denies the allegations influenced him. He said he had planned to leave and that case simply gave him the push to finally jump ship to the bar.“I am doing much better than when I was a magistrate in terms of everything, even my health, I have increased in size,” he said.By the time he was leaving the Judiciary, he had risen the ranks to the position of principal magistrate.Even though Khaemba is new to practice, he has managed to land some high-profile cases in court.He is one of lawyers representing former Sports CS Rashid Echesa in his corruption case and has managed to get several wins against the state in the case.POLITICAL AMBITIONSOn his political ambitions, Khaemba says his name will be on the ballot come 2022, contesting for the position of MP in Kimilili constituency.The lawyer, who will be up against the incumbent Didmus Barasa, says it’s the constituents who have approached him to go and represent them.“People of Kimilili have gone back to the drawing board and said the graph of leadership in terms of MP has drastically gone down since the exit of Dr Eseli Simiyu, and they are looking for someone who can take it back to where it was,” he says.Khaemba does not have a social life as much because the little time he gets is used to travel back home to address the issues of the people of Kimilili.“When you are a part-time political practitioner and a full-time legal practitioner, your free time goes to the part time,” he says.Khaemba is happily married with three children — two boys and one girl — and his wife works for Nairobi City county.Edited by T Jalio"
138,"Ruto's sloganeering will take Kenya to the dogs, says Raila","ODM leader Raila Odinga has warned that Deputy President William Ruto will take the country to the dogs with his sloganeering, which he says is dividing the country into social classes.The opposition chief blasted Ruto’s dynasty versus hustler rallying call, saying it is a dangerous trajectory that has the potential of ""upsetting the peace and stability of our nation.""The DP has hinged his 2022 presidential campaigns around the hustler movement, which is meant to appeal to the majority of poor who he considers to be hard-working Kenyans always looking for opportunities.But Raila said the move is a time-bomb and must not be allowed to take root.He gave the example of Germany’s Adolf Hilter who rallied the country on anti-Jews slogan and ended up plunging the European nation into a bloodbath.The ODM party leader said Hitler’s script of 1930s almost saw Germany on self-destruction mode due to the reckless anti-Jews slogan.“Germany was just emerging from the effects of the Second World War. Things were terrible. During the great depression, things were so tough in Europe and a young man came up and said these people cannot do it they have no ideas, I have the solution; to do it first there are leeches in our society and we need to get rid of them,” Raila said.He added, “Jews are the problem; Give me 10 years and I will give you a new Germany and he took power democratically. After dealing with the Jews the whole world went to war by the end of it, it was a different Germany and not the Germany he promised them.”Raila cautioned against the ""divisive"" hustler narrative adding that if not tamed in good time then Kenya will find itself where Germany was in the 1930s.“Sloganeering is a very dangerous thing; our people must not allow our country to go to the dogs. This country deserves better and that is why we are saying we need a unity of purpose among the people of Kenya,” he said.The AU special envoy on infrastructure was addressing student leaders from various universities across the country in Nairobi.He called on the students to stand firm against campaigns that are only meant to divide the country along class lines.“You have a responsibility to rescue this country from those who want to destroy it and make Kenya become a great nation. This country deserves better and this is also what we want to bequeath the future generation,” Raila said.He called on youths to rally behind the BBI as it promises a sustainable solution to many problems facing young people.“That is why we started with BBI, it is a document that lays the foundation for the social economic transformation of our country.”The Nasa leader was accompanied by Siaya Senator James Orengo, MPs Esther Passaris (Nairobi), Abdulswamad Nassir (Mvita), Mishi Mboko (Likoni), Babu Owino (Embakasi East) and businesswoman Agnes Kagure.Raila also criticised Ruto for using questionable wealth to run his hustler project at a time the government is choking with high-profile corruption.“The level of corruption is too high in the government and that is what has continued to impoverish our people,” he said.He claimed the SGR project - the brainchild of the Grand Coalition Government – was inflated by the Jubilee administration from Sh227 billion to Sh380 billion.He said the proceeds were part of the tokenism being dished to unsuspecting Kenyans. Edited by P.O"
139,"More than 286,000 officers to man KCPE, KCSE exams","Heavy manpower will be deployed to ensure the success of this year’s KCPE and KCSE exams to be written under special Covid-19 circumstances.The Kenya National Examination Council says 286,901 field officers— supervisors and invigilators —will be contracted for exams administration compared to the 173,000 field officers engaged in 2019.The details are contained in a document assessing preparedness for the two national examinations.This year's exams will be done in March and April. Traditionally, the tests are conducted between October and November.For KCPE, 1,191,411 candidates are registered to take the test in 28,451 centres.For KCSE, 752,933 candidates will sit the exams in 10,437 centres compared to 10,287 approved in 2019.Following the long closure of learning institutions, Knec is gathering data on schools closed down during the shutdown and the candidates affected.Among the issues put into consideration is likely adverse weather as the exams will be conducted during the long rains season.The council also points to insecurity and flooding of major lakes and rivers in various parts of the country.The Star has also established that the schools' unrest is a new headache for the smooth running of the examinations.The examinations will be the fifth in a row to be administered under the strict measures to prevent cheating adopted in 2016.In this year's examinations, the council has secured 479 containers at the subcounty headquarters where the examination papers will be housed.The containers will have a double locking system and the subcounty director of education and the deputy county commissioners will be the only ones authorised to open and close them.Vast subcounties will get extra containers that will be located in the assistant county commissioner's office.The process of appointing supervisors and invigilators is ongoing and will be completed at the end of February.Knec will also put in place the required mechanisms to be used to deliver and return the exam materials.Preparation for marking of the exams is also ongoing and those involved in the process will include 7,402 KCPE examiners and 27,248 KCSE examiners.Road and air transport will be used to avert any disruption that could occur.KCPE will commence on Monday, March 22 and end on Wednesday, March 24.KCSE candidates will undergo their rehearsals on March 25 before sitting their written exams from March 26 to April 21.For learners with special needs, Knec will have a toll-free line for school heads to convey any emerging cases that require intervention.In total, 2,689 learners with special needs will sit this year’s KCPE and another 1,891 will sit the KCSE test.Among those sitting KCPE exams 112 are blind, 633 are affected with low vision, 1,207 are physically challenged and 737 have a hearing impairment.Of those sitting KCSE 113 are blind, 502 have low vision, 712 are physically challenged and 564 are hearing impaired."
140,"Six more die of Covid, 27 on oxygen","Six more patients succumbed to Covid-19, pushing the fatalities to 1,750.In a statement on Tuesday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe confirmed that 141 Kenyans had tested positive for the virus, bringing the caseload to 100,193.The new cases were from a sample size of 3,571 tested in 24 hours, representing a positivity rate of 3.9 per cent.The cases comprised of 121 Kenyans and 20 foreign nationals aged between one year and 87 years old.“There are 500 patients currently admitted in various health facilities countrywide, while 1,340 are in home-based isolation and care,” Kagwe said.“Twenty-five patients are in the intensive care unit, 14 of whom are on ventilator support and 10 on supplemental oxygen. One patient is under observation,” he added.According to the CS, another 17 patients were separately on supplementary oxygen with 10 of them in the general wards and seven in the high dependency unit.“Today, 207 patients have recovered from the disease, 192 are form home-based isolation and care while 15 are from our various facilities.

141,Bryan Khaemba: Why I don't miss the bench,"A judicial officer is either a magistrate or judge working in the judiciary to dispense justice to the public.Having worked as a magistrate for nine years before changing careers, lawyer Bryan Khaemba says it is a very time-consuming and challenging job that needs one to be dedicated.“The life of a judicial officer is a bit restricted. He or she must behave like Caesar’s wife. You cannot be at some places that seem ordinary. Even dancing, you must dance as a judicial officer,” he says.He does not miss his former job because it restricted him from doing a lot of things, which he can now do because is no longer a state officer.However, since leaving the Judiciary, Khaemba says he has been healthier and even added weight because he has no pressure.He says being a lawyer, there is no pressure like being a judicial officer, where you have to write judgments and rulings that take a lot of time.“When I got home with the files, the kids knew I'm going to the study room and I'd lock myself there, which meant there was no playing with daddy,” he says.Khaemba was at one point suspended by CJ David Maraga over alleged bribery by Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu to rule in his favour. Khaemba sued the CJ and won the case, but by the time the judgement was out, he had opened a law firm, which was generating huge sums of money, with over 120 active files in different courts.“The money I could get as salary in the Judiciary for 12 months, I could make it within three days. Why would I go back to the judiciary? This is the place I ought to have been from way back,” he says.CONFLICT OF INTEREST?Having switched from the bench to the bar, and due to his role at KMJA, some lawyers are not comfortable when he appears before some judges and magistrates.Khaemba says most times, the lawyers on the opposite side will ask the judicial officer to recuse themselves because he was their former colleague.“Personally I don’t have a problem because I have never gone to a judge or magistrate and said, 'I helped you somewhere so you should also help me.' No, I go there as an ordinary advocate and argue my case,” Khaemba says.He further says he does not get any special favours in court. He wins some cases and loses others.“The issue comes up quite often, which I expect. I always agree with the application but my question is, tell me which other judge or magistrate has never been my friend or colleague? So am I supposed to go and practice in Uganda?” he says.One of his lowest moments while at the Judiciary was when one time, the prosecution asked to withdraw a case that was ongoing but the accused protested, telling me he knew what they were up to.Khaemba says he dismissed the objection by the accused and was wondering why he was objecting yet he was in custody and would now get his freedom.“I allowed the application by prosecution, he was acquitted, but he was arrested at the door of the court. Later, I learnt that he was killed later that evening, and it really bothered me for a while, why I didn’t listen to him,” he says.DRUNK DRIVINGMany wonder why he ruled that drunk driving is not a crime so long as the driver can be in control of the vehicle.Khaemba says he did not believe the accused in the case he handled was incapable of driving a motor vehicle. At the time of his arrest, he had overpowered three policemen, but they told him he was too drunk to drive a car.“They should have told me he was driving zigzag, going off road and when they tested him, he had exceeded the limit. Now that would be an offence,” he says.“So even if I take a 20 litres of chang’aa and I go to the road and drive very well, I have not committed any offence. That’s why I released him.”Interestingly, Khaemba says some Kenyans have scanned the judgment and every time they are stopped by police, they show it to them, saying this is the law.Edited by T Jalio"
142,Kenyan journalists to benefit from WAN-IFRA's media freedom programme,"Kenyan journalists are among those who will benefit from the World Association of News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) media freedom programme.The association in its latest programme targeting Sub-Saharan Africa said the over 120.4 million partnership with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs will support media freedom in nine countries across the region.The association in a press lease said it will work with print and digital media organisations in Kenya, Botswana, Malawi, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The programme seeks to improve the safety of journalists and the security of newsrooms, increase media-led advocacy around press freedom and gender-related issues, provide high-level business and editorial management support, and offer financial assistance to strengthen public interest reporting.The partnership builds on a previous three-year strategic engagement with the Ministry (2015-2018) and complements WAN-IFRA’s existing programme engagements on the African continent through long-term collaborations with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the ground-breaking Women In News programme, as well as the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. WAN-IFRA CEO, Vincent Peyrègne said The last 12 months have exacerbated an already difficult situation for media globally, and African newsrooms are no exception.He said as a result, many are struggling to successfully transition towards a digital future, innovate their products to remain appealing to audiences, or strengthen their business and editorial competencies under such harsh financial conditions.“We are delighted to renew our partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and to start work on this important new project with our colleagues across Africa,” he said.He added, ""The safety of journalists and persistent threats to press freedom make supporting colleagues across the continent an urgent priority.”According to the association, it will identify newsrooms and media partners who will be invited to participate in the initiative.Drawing on its Women in News network, the organisation’s Media Freedom Committees in Africa, and a growing membership community, up to 25 organisations will be selected to benefit from the resources and opportunities provided by this new programme.Over the course of the three-year project, WAN-IFRA will work with media partners to assess their approach to safety, offering training and direct assistance to strengthen journalists’ knowledge and preparedness as well as organisational responses to threats and strengthen and build media-led advocacy networks and campaign on media freedom issues relevant to local journalists.Other areas will be to tailor support to editorial and business development through training and mentoring and provide micro-grants to finance public interest reporting.Press Freedom Executive Director Andrew Heslop said the new project strengthens WAN-IFRA’s engagement with media across Africa, giving them the opportunity to build on their support to long-term partners who have been on the front lines of defending press freedom for many years, but also crucially the chance to welcome exciting new media voices whose vision for Africa is essential to include.“It is an important year for media freedom in Africa, with the 30th anniversary of UNESCO’s pivotal Windhoek Declaration providing a necessary point of reflection to judge successes and understand the work still required to ensure a strong, independent press can flourish,” he said."
143,Kibwana quits CoG chair race to focus on presidency,"Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana now says he will not contest for the Council of Governors chairmanship.Kibwana said he wants to focus on his 2022 presidential ambitions.""I will not be a candidate for Council of Governors elections. As a 2022 presidential candidate, I have been advised by my team that serving in the next CoG executive can constitute a conflict of interest,""  he said on Tuesday.Kibwana said he was grateful to his colleagues for the opportunity to serve as their  Chief Whip.The CoG elections will be held on January 29.The next chairman will pick up from Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya who was elected in February 2020 for a second and final term in office through consensus after President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila backed his bid.There are reports that Uhuru will throw his weight behind a governor who supports the BBI process to succeed Oparanya. The head of state has enjoyed a good working relationship with Oparanya during the latter's tenure. Their camaraderie blossomed further with their BBI agitation.The CoG chairmanship is a powerful post that serves as a link between the county governments and the national Executive and has a lot of leverage, including unfettered access to the President.The chairperson serves as the voice of the county governments and has a lot of privileges, including a stand-by chopper funded by taxpayers through the council's secretariat.Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana has declared interest in the position.""A new broom sweeps clean... I am coming at a time when we are heading to elections... I am capable of taking the mantle and synergising the council to live its purpose,"" he told the Star on Friday.Drumming support for his candidature, Godhana said he is the best person to defend devolution.""I will lobby for partnerships. I have experience and the exposure needed. I am here to present new and good ideas as we protect devolution,"" he said.Godhana said the chairmanship role was rotational and it would only be fair if it was taken to Coast."
144,"I still have time to roar like a lion, Uhuru tells critics","President Uhuru Kenyatta has hit back at his critics, saying he still has time to roar like a lion.Uhuru on Tuesday said his critics are busy hitting out at him thinking that his time is over and he cannot do anything.He spoke when he commissioned the construction of a leadership police academy and 210 housing units in Ngong.""Leo sitaki kuongelea siasa sababu lazima hio siasa tutaongea... Unajua wengine wananiangalia wanasema huyu anaenda, atafanya nini? Niwakumbushe hata kama anaenda, bado kuna siku kadhaa ya kuguruma kama simba,"" he said.(Today I do not want to politic but yes we must politic. There are some people who look at me and think  I have nothing I can do since my time is up; but I want to remind them that even though my time is almost up, I still have some days to roar like a lion).Uhuru has faced sharp criticism, especially from his deputy William Ruto after his dramatic suggestion of an end to the Kikuyu-Kalenjin domination of the presidency.His remarks seemed to have jolted DP William Ruto's succession plan and offered a political lifeline to Nasa principals.Uhuru gave the clearest hint he will not back Ruto for the presidency and may in fact campaign against him.Uhuru said Mt Kenya and the Kalenjin communities have produced the country’s four presidents since Independence and should pave the way for other communities. “Even me, I can stand here and say there are only two Kenyan communities that have led. Maybe it's time for other tribes to lead. Kenya has many communities,” Uhuru said, getting a standing ovation from sections of the mourners.An angry Uhuru also declared that he is firmly in charge of the government and that his silence should not be misconstrued as weakness.“Msione simba amenyeshewa mkadhani ni paka… I am in charge of this government and I am in control of what we are doing.”Raila, now virtually in government-backed Uhuru's sentiments saying it was time the country’s top seat went to another tribe outside of the Kikuyu and Kalenjin communities.But Ruto while asking the president, his boss to stop the threats read the riot act saying Uhuru was dragging back the country to what he called the backward politics of tribalism.In what are clearly the last stages of an acrimonious divorce defining the 2022 presidential contest, Ruto said he was ready to face off with the handshake brigade and urged Uhuru to stop “threats and blackmail"".In a rare public exchange between Uhuru and Ruto, the DP said he has supported Uhuru thrice, knowing that he was a Kikuyu and the son of a former President.“Many of those who were speaking at the burial of Musalia Mudavadi’s mother are the ones who were telling me you cannot support another Kikuyu and I told them I am not supporting Uhuru Kenyatta because of his tribe, I am supporting him because we have a plan to change Kenya,” Ruto said at the House of Hope Church in Kayole on Sunday.He said he rallied behind Uhuru with Kibaki still at State House in a deliberate move to end what he termed “the politics of stupidity of grouping people in tribes"".“Don’t drive us the narrative of exclusion, of telling us about tribes and tribal chiefs. My friends, Wajinga wameisha Kenya,” Ruto said.“Let no one threaten you,” Ruto told his troops, mainly Mt Kenya MPs who had taken turns to hit out at the President.“You know this country, people are threatening each other. Me and these leaders have been threatened over many things. Some have been taken to court, some removed from parliamentary leadership and some have their accounts frozen.”He went on, “Don’t waste your time with threats, don’t waste your time with blackmail. Don’t waste your time with everything you are doing. You can do it as much as you want but we must change this country.”Ruto said the next head of state will be elected on their policies and not based on their ethnicity."
145,Police are not your enemies - Uhuru tells Kenyans,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has refuted claims that the Kenya Police is the enemy number one for the public.Uhuru on Tuesday said just like a household might have one or two children who go against good values, there are a few elements within the police that taint the image of the entire service.The Head of State spoke on Tuesday when he commissioned the construction of a leadership police academy and 210 housing units in Ngong.While reiterating that a time has come for the entire police leadership to be transformed, Uhuru said such transformation will see the security sector moved to the next level.He said his government's intention has always been to take care of the welfare of the security sector by ensuring the officers are fully equipped with the necessary skills and training they need.""I want to assure all of you that these officers are not your enemies but your friends. Just respect the law and follow instructions,""  he said.""There will always be bad elements within the police but that is the order in the society. However, that should not amount to blanket accusations and generalization,"" he added.Uhuru said mechanisms have been put in place by the National Police Service to ensure that such bad elements are punished.The project which is funded by Central Bank of Kenya at Sh1 billion, is set to be completed by end of 2021 and launched early January 2022.Upon completion, the academy will provide the National Police Service with modern facilities for the training of its senior leadership.""The idea of this leadership academy was born out of my administrative desire to see police leadership on another level,"" he said.He added, ""Today's occasion is the most recent example of how government institutions can come together in synergy and promote the welfare and capabilities of the security sector"".He said under the directorate of criminal investigations, he will soon launch the forensic lab. ""All these efforts are aimed at making the Police more efficient at service delivery,"" he said.Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said the department was grateful to CBK for supporting the project.""We also thank other corporates that have been part of other developmental projects in the security industry. Your Excellency, we will not let you down,"" Matiang'i said. The leadership college sits on a 120-acre piece of land where only 18acres are currently in use.Overall construction for the project will be locally sourced where 56 per cent of materials will be local .These include; Adequate accommodation for 220, classrooms and lecture rooms, well-equipped auditorium with seating for 450, kitchen and dining facilities and recreational facilities."
146,Court bars Shoprite supermarkets from leaving Kenya,"A Nairobi court has blocked Shoprite chain of supermarkets from leaving the country later this month until the case filed by one of their shoppers is heard.In the case Patrick Alouis Maina has sued Shoprite claiming that while shopping at their Garden City Branch, a stack of plastic lids fell on him causing him injury.In his ruling, Justice Antony Mrima has stopped Shoprite from removing or selling any of their assets from the county pending hearing of the case.“Restraining the Respondent herein, Shoprite Checkers Limited, from selling transferring or concluding any sale or transfer of its business as a going concern,” the court ruled.Judge Mrima said that in the event that Shoprite is allowed to leave Kenya as they intend to then it will be hard to enforce any order of the court.“In order to strike a balance between the rival positions, and prior to determining whether this Court has the jurisdiction to deal with this Petition, it is only fair that an interim relief be granted,” the court ruled.Maina had claimed that the supermarket had plans of closing down its shops in Kenya later this month.Maina has accused Shoprite of negligence.The father of two who was shopping with his family says he suffered several injuries swollen lips, lacerations on the lips and bleeding inside the mouth.Maina further says other injuries that were not outwardly visible were splitting headaches, dizziness and temporary mental confusion.Maina says the supermarket chose and maintained the unsafe method of stacking the container lids ostensibly to maximize shelf space for profitThey also failed to display a warning or safety notice near the unsafely displayed product.He further claims that immediately after the accident happened, the management was informed but they refused to take him to hospital.According to court papers, Maina then decided to use his phone to take photos of what happened and took himself to Avenue Hospital within Garden City.Maina requested for First Aid and to be taken to hospital but the attendant claimed that he did not have any authority to do anything about the accident.“Prior to the accident, Patrick had been developing, a complex financial Services software product with innovative features, but since then he has been unable to complete it due to the anxiety induced by the accident,” reads court papers.According to court papers, since the accident Maina’s brain gets tired faster than before and he finds it harder to deal with levels of complexity that were previously easy for him.He further argues that he has missed out on numerous future opportunities and anticipated income around the world that he would have initiated and or pursued had the accident not disrupted his life and cognitive abilities."

Aside from the military and police surrounding us, military and police helicopters have been consistently hovering over our residence in breach of our privacy rights,” Wine said.The police have been camping outside Robert Kyagulanyi’s home in Kampala for more than 11 days.It started on January 14, when the country held its general election where Wine was seeking to unseat President Yoweri Museveni.In a ruling, the High Court judge asked the government to present the charges against Wine in court instead of putting him under siege.Last week, the singer-turned politician posted that he was running out of basic commodities since he and his family are unable to move out of the house, which he said is surrounded by the military.Wine had promised to make public the irregularities that were reported during the election. He said the move had been delayed by the internet blackout across the East-African country.The Electoral Commission Chairman Simon Byabakama had challenged Wine to follow the law and prove his claims."

This is out of the 4.2 million signatures collected by the BBI team led by the Orange Democratic Movement last year.IEBC only needed to verify one million signatures. With the verification, it means that the BBI Bill will be transmitted to the 47 county assemblies.In a letter seen on Tuesday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said notified the assemblies that the Initiative has met the requisite threshold as provided in Article 257 (4) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. ""...the Commission hereby submits a copy of the draft BBI (Constitutional Amendment) Bill 2020, to your County Assembly for consideration within three months from the date hereof,"" Chebukati said.If a county assembly approves the draft Bill, the speaker of the county assembly shall deliver a copy of the draft Bill jointly to the Speakers of the two Houses of Parliament, with a certificate that the county assembly has approved it.Article 157(7) says that if the draft Bill has been approved by a majority of the county assemblies, it shall be introduced in Parliament without delay. If a majority of the members of each House pass the Bill, it shall be submitted to the President for assent.On Thursday, the electoral commission, in a notice published after verification of about 1.3 million signatures, asked voters to confirm if they indeed signed.“Anyone who has been captured as a supporter without their consent can report to the commission by writing to the CEO indicating their objections.”IEBC had sought Sh241 million for the verification before they negotiated with the National Treasury for Sh97.3 million."
151,"Nyati barracks opened as Kenya, UK strengthen ties","The new Nyati Barracks has been officially opened at the British Army Training Unit Kenya in Nanyuki.This was part of a two-day visit to Kenya by the UK’s Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace MP. Opening the barracks alongside Defence CS Monica Juma, Wallace took a tour of the refurbished facility, speaking to Kenyan and British troops, as well some of the hundreds of Kenyans employed by the base. BATUK has contributed in excess of Sh5.8 billion to the local economy since the Defence Cooperation Agreement was signed in 2016, and it has also created employment for over 550 Kenyans.“I’m delighted to open the Nyati Barracks with Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma, as we continue to strengthen our defence partnership together,"" Wallace said.“We both have ambitions to make more of BATUK, with Kenyan and British soldiers training alongside each other as partners.”He said that they want to develop the facility to something beyond just training – and use it as a demonstration of deepening partnership. British High Commissioner to Kenya Jane Marriott said the joint training with Kenyan Defence Forces is one of the many fantastic examples of partnership on security with Kenya. ""After agreeing a refreshed Security Compact this week, our work together at Nyati Barracks is another sign of our enduring friendship,"" she said.Despite the disruption caused by COVID-19, training has recommenced at the counter-IED centre in Embakasi and joint pre-deployment exercises ahead of AMISOM deployment."

153,Shop N Buy directors summoned in Kemsa scandal probe,"The Public Investment Committee has issued summons to directors of Shop N Buy company after they failed to appear for probe into their involvement in the Kemsa scandal.The company is being investigated after it was allocated Covid-19 supplies worth Sh970 million.PIC is investigating about 100 companies implicated in the scandal.The firm's directors were due to appear before the Committee to answer to queries on how it got the tender award.PIC chairman Abdulswamad Nassir said they had given sufficient notice to the firm to appear before the committee.Last month, Kemsa procurement director's secretary Pamela Kaburu admitted she was instructed to backdate a commitment letter for the company.Kaburu said in Parliament that she was ordered by suspended CEO Jonah Manjari to indicate Shop N Buy’s letter had been written on April 30.The firm is among those being probed by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for its role in the questionable purchases that left Kemsa with a Sh6.2 billion debt.Kaburu told the Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir-led Public Investments Committee that the letter to the three-month-old firm for Sh900 million worth of supplies had been dated May 8.The secretary said she had no alternative but to obey the orders and that she could not question Manjari over the move since he was her boss.Kaburu said her immediate boss Charles Juma (suspended procurement director), also told her it was okay “since she had been instructed to write the letter.”“I only wrote one letter. I can’t know if there were others that were also backdated in a similar fashion. It is possible, though, that some were backdated at the CEO’s office since they had the template,” she told MPs.Kaburu said a number of commitment letters were issued by Manjari without the knowledge of the procurement office."

155,"AUC Chair Faki calls for Kenya, Somalia dialogue to end tension","The Chairperson of the African Union Commission (AUC) has said that peace on the Kenya-Somalia border is vital to regional stability.Moussa Faki, through a post on his Twitter account on Tuesday morning, said that he is following the tensions on the two neighbouring countries with concern.The AUC chair has urged both the governments of Kenya and Somalia to exercise restraint and engage in dialogue in conformity with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) led process.“I’m following the tensions on the Kenya-Somalia border with concern, and urge the two neighbours to exercise restraint and engage in dialogue in conformity with the IGAD-led process,” Faki said.On Monday, the government of Somalia alleged that the armed militia armed by the government of Kenya crossed the border into its territory on Sunday night and attacked the Gedo, district of Beled Xaawo.“The Federal Government of Somalia strongly condemns this illegal aggression orchestrated and planned within Kenya. These actions are an affront to the peaceful coexistence of international norms of mutual respect, territorial integrity and national sovereignty,” the Somalia government said in a statement.The Kenyan Government through Interior CS Fred Matiang’i denied any cause of alarm between Kenya and Somalia, saying that the government has put in place enough security forces to protects its people following the tension caused by the inside war between Somalia and Somaliland.Kenya’s Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambi had also said that there is no need to raise alarm, adding the country is secured.At least 12 people were injured in a renewed fighting between Somalia National Army and Jubaland security forces at the neighbouring Bulahawa town on Monday, even as Kenyan government claimed that the security had been heightened.Kenya had expressed concern over the fighting in a Diplomatic Note to the Chairperson African Union Commission.The town of Bula Hawa is a few kilometres from the Kenya-Somalia border.In December 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta attended Igad’s meeting in Djibouti with hopes of resolving the Kenya-Somalia spat.The meeting was also attended by Somalia’s Mohamed Farmajo, Sudan Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who is the Igad chairman, and Faki.Igad is a body comprising seven countries in the Horn of Africa.

157,US President Biden adds South Africa to Covid travel bans,"The Biden administration has renewed Trump-era Covid-19 travel bans on non-US visitors from Brazil and most of Europe, including the UK and Ireland.The White House also imposed a new ban on South Africa over its virus variant.Former President Donald Trump had ordered the bans to end on January 26 as one of his final acts in office.The new travel restrictions came as Minnesota recorded the first US case of the Brazil variant from a resident who had recently travelled to that country.""This case marks the first documented instance of the Brazil P.1 variant in the United States,"" said the Minnesota Department of Health on Monday.The unnamed patient lives in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area, said the department.With the national coronavirus case count above 25 million cases, the US is seeking to ramp up its vaccine rollout.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the decision to continue the restrictions on foreign travellers on Monday.""On the advice of our administration's medical and Covid team, President Biden has decided to maintain the restrictions previously in place for the European Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, and Brazil,"" Ms Psaki told reporters.""With the pandemic worsening and more contagious variants spreading, this isn't the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel. And in light of the contagious variant, B1351, South Africa has been added to the restricted list.""All international travellers must also present a negative test within three days of air travel to the US.Travel restrictions have been in place since mid-March.When Mr Trump ordered a ban on flights from China in February, citing the ""Chinese virus"", Mr Biden railed against ""Donald Trump's record of hysterical xenophobia"". At the time, the Biden campaign denied the remark was about Mr Trump's travel ban.When asked about Mr Biden's stance in light of the ""xenophobic"" remark, Ms Psaki said: ""He was critical of the former president for having a policy that was not more comprehensive than travel restrictions and he conveyed at the time - and more recently - the importance of having a multi-faceted approach."""
158,"Sonko, Kibicho have been on warpath for over one year","The clash between Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and Interior PS Karanja Kibicho has been in the limelight for over a year now.Known for his courage for letting the cat out of the bag, Sonko has been dragging Kibicho’s name in his woes and issues affecting the county.At one point he branded Kibicho as the ‘deep state’ while appearing on local Television.During Sonko’s first impeachment that flopped in February 2020, close people to him had hinted that the plan was being overseen by a powerful state officer.“We know that some MCAs who were in power back then was working with a big state official who wanted Sonko ousted to be successful,” said a first term MCA, who sought anonymity.Two months later, Sonko lamented and claimed that police officers who were frustrating him were working under the instructions of the Interior PS to frustrate him.He had accused the officers of hampering his initiative to fight Covid-19 pandemic, where sanitizing booths which had been set up in the CBD were destroyed.""I am saddened by the vandalism that occurred earlier today, supervised by the Kibra Deputy County Commissioner who personally confirmed his ill actions to me,” Sonko said.""He was allegedly following instructions from the Nairobi Regional Coordinator, who also confirmed the same to my chief of staff, on the removal and vandalism of the new public sanitization booth that had been installed at the Kibra DCC's offices.""The booths had been set up at the Kencom bus stage, Mathare, Korogocho, Nyayo Estate, Greenspan, the area outside Kenyatta National Hospital, and Buruburu shopping centres.As a result, Sonko Rescue Team, through Lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui under a certificate of urgency accused Nairobi Regional Security Commissioner Wilson Njenga and Health CS Mutahi Kagwe of interfering with the goodwill to help in the fight against spreading Covid-19.The High Court when ahead and stopped the destruction of the Covid-19 sanitiser booths set up in various parts of Nairobi.Justice Weldon Korir asked Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, his PS Kibicho, CS Kagwe, Inspector-General of Police Hilary Mutyambai and the Nairobi RC Wilson Njenga to stop the exercise.The flamboyant former county boss said he was planning to take Kibicho and Regional Police Commander Philip Ndolo to the ICC.He accused that the two accompanied by Nairobi RC Wilson Njenga had committed crimes against humanity.Sonko further claimed that Kibicho instructed their officers and officers working under them to stop his agents and officers from fumigating and disinfecting streets and public establishments across Nairobi City.""On diverse dates. The defendants have through their officers and officials working under them demolished and vandalized installations including sanitization booths installed by the plaintiff,"" he said.In August, Sonko went ahead and accused Interior CS Fred Matiangi, his PS Kibicho and the ‘deep state’ of messing the country.While being hosted on Citizen TV’s JKLive, he branded the two as the “deep state’ and said President Uhuru was not to blame for the incidences of police brutality and misuse of state machinery.“Uhuru is a very hardworking man, the problem is the system and the deep state, Matiangi and Kibicho are misusing the state machinery,"" Sonko said.The two were back at it again on Monday with Kibicho declaring the beginning of a war with Sonko and vowed to sue him over the remarks he made on Sunday while in Dagoretti.The former Governor claimed that they planned chaos in Nairobi during the general election in 2017 with Kibicho. “I want to reveal here that in 2017, I and Kibicho, together with the system, printed ODM T-shirts, bought second-hand cars, then burnt them on Ngong Road so as to be seen it was ODM supporters that had burnt them,"" claimed Sonko.On Monday, Kibicho distanced himself from the accusations and recorded a statement with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI)  and accused Sonko of character assassination.The PS also declared to go the legal way and would seek justice on the statements Sonko made publicly admitting to crimes. “I am not at DCI as PS Interior, but as Karanja Kibicho, and Sonko shall give me answers if there’s law in this country. He must prove all the allegations he has accused me of. He better prepare some good lawyers because he has admitted to the crime, and after he has dealt with that, he will have to deal with my character assassination case,” Kibicho said.“It's not okay for Sonko to keep making wild allegations against people. I have had enough because, for the longest time when Sonko has had enough, he blames Kibicho. It’s clear he has no respect for the rule of law. You make allegations that you can defend.” Saying ‘bring it on’, Sonko threatened to reveal what he termed as incriminating evidence against Kibicho and the system.""I, therefore, look forward to an invitation from the DCI to record my statement, and for the PS to move to court quickly so that I can table ALL the evidence I have for Kenyans to see and judge for themselves,"" he said""I am also ready to table evidence of how the deep state organized the attempted assassination of former P.M Raila Odinga in 2017, and how the same system financed the delivery of sewerage at the Jacaranda Grounds to prevent the then People's President from holding a public rally.""""I was the main mobilizer in Nairobi for the so-called system, so, I know what I am talking about and I have a lot to tell my fellow Kenyans and the world,"" Sonko added."
159,10 students arrested for torching Kiambere school dormitory,"A 17-year-old boy has been arrested as the main suspect alongside nine others in the torching of a dormitory at Kiambere Secondary School in Embu County.DCI boss George Kinoti said the suspect was arrested following an identification parade, after detectives discovered that he had prior to the incident, sent a pupil from a neighbouring primary school to buy him a matchbox.""The suspect is cooperating well with our investigators and so far, he has revealed names of nine other students with whom they executed the treacherous act,"" Kinoti said.The students all aged between 15 and 19  have been placed in custody at Kiritiri Police Station and will be arraigned at Siakago Law Courts today, to answer to their crimes.Kinoti has cautioned other students harbouring similar intentions to seek alternative problem-solving mechanisms.On Monday, Kinoti issued a warning to students involved in criminal activities while in school.DCI said that it is archiving and consolidating charges that may be preferred against students involved in crime.“Let each student be informed that it will automatically be reflected on the Police Clearance Certificate (Certificate of Good Conduct) when such a student will apply for one,” DCI said.“This will be a permanent criminal mark that will bar many students from achieving their goals as no employer of worth will dare employ such characters.”The crimes mentioned include armed and unpeaceful demonstrations, arson, drugs, cyberbullying, assault of any degree, drunkenness, or any reported crime of any kind."
160,"Divorce cases scar children, prompt calls for mediation","Family is the most basic unit of a society and it is beautiful. It is the safe place when all else fails.However, when family relations break down, the aftermath is ugly. And children tend to bear the brunt. They suffer emotional, psychological and physical trauma.Though family disputes have always been in Kenyan courts, the past one year has had a surge in matrimonial cases, with a worrying number of children dragged to court as a result.Senior counsel John Chigiti blames the escalation of disputes in families on Covid-19, the sudden loss of jobs and closure of schools. This placed a huge unprecedented social and economic pressure on many homes and brought about a lot of tension. Domestic violence cases shot up.Cases of drug abuse, cybercrime and child pregnancies sky rocketed, he said. All this was happening under one roof, with little or no access to counselling facilities. Family members became irritable.“With every family member competing for the little that was there, everything became a conflict trigger,” he said.“Small fires were lit all over. The future was unpredictable. Everyone’s life was under threat. There was no money, no cure, no direction.“The Health CS and his poetic updates was everyone's salvation. Every day we kept hoping to hear him announce an end to the Covid-19 pandemic.”This presented a toxic family set-up that reflected in a surge of matrimonial disputes. During the Covid-19 era, children became the most vulnerable family member. Many were neglected and left to fend for themselves.“Many homes broken, leaving the children in need of care and protection. Many children found themselves in need of upkeep, custody and access orders,” Chigiti added.DIGITAL TRIALSThe senior counsel said things became so gloomy and hopeless to many children when the courts suddenly closed their doors in March 2020, when Covid-19 picked momentum.While all this mess was unfolding in many homes under the cover of the long, dark and painful curfew nights, Chief Justice David Maraga, now retired, was toiling on an ICT solution.“Within no time, he propelled access to justice to another level when he rolled out the e-judiciary. The courts suddenly became accessible to all. One could file a case from the comfort of their bedroom,” Chigiti said.This led to an avalanche in children's cases that were filed in the Children's Court in 2020.Normally the court journey begins when a parent or a guardian files a case on behalf of the child in the Children's Court. The most common orders they seek are custody, access and upkeep orders.The suit papers are then delivered to the offending parent, who files their reply. The two parents are then heard by the court before a determination is rendered.In some instances, the court orders the children to be brought to court, depending on prevailing circumstances, on a case-by-case basis.The court process can be very dramatic at times. Some parents usually take the children with them to court, probably for purposes of generating an impact on the minds of the court.Many times, the children who appear in court witness the bare-knuckle parental fights. The court tries not to expose the children to these excesses. However, it is not fully achievable.Sometimes it gets ugly when the children are 'ripped' from one parent and handed over to the other parent.The court at times issues orders in the process of enforcing its judgement through the mechanisms available in The Children Act. These include arrests, which can take place in court. Unfortunately, this can inevitably happen in the full glare of children who had attended court.Ultimately, in a regular case, after the judgment, the court settles the dispute and it is upon the parties to obey the directions of the court.ENTER MEDIATIONLawyer Shadrack Wambui, who has also handled family disputes, believes mediation should be the first priority by courts and lawyers.Wambui, who is both an advocate and a mediator, is a strong proponent of this alternative mechanism.""When these cases end up in court, the court should prioritise mediation as opposed to having a fight of parties. In protection of the family as a unit, as provided for under article 45 of the Constitution,"" he said in an interview with the Star.Secondly, he said, mediation should be adopted to safeguard the best interests of a child as provided for under article 53.""It is important that the child's welfare is guarded. The child should be protected from exposure to war where people spew all kinds of words against each other.""He believes the children are needlessly victimised. ""Fahali wawili wakipigana, nyasi huumia (when two bulls fight, it is the grass that suffers).""In cases he has handled, sometimes the fights between parents start from home, where kids are exposed to violence and later subjected to court drama.""In most cases, a child will be tormented by what they see in court, which has psychological effects. We end up having a child who is mentally disturbed,"" he said. Wambui says he has seen magistrates ordering children to be taken to psychologists to allow them to cope with what they see in court.Mediation registrar Carole Kendagor, who also spoke to the Star, believes all children's cases should take the mediation route as the first option to ensure the child’s best interest is well taken care of.“It ought to be a requirement that parties in children's cases attempt mediation before going for litigation to resolve their dispute,” she said.She believes mediation will highly likely result in restoration of relations between parents, hence parental love for the children and their holistic development. Whereas litigation, being adversarial, may further break relations between the parties.“This ruins parental love for the minors’ subject matter to the case and affects the growth of the children,” Kendagor said.In mediation, confidentiality is key. However, in litigation, sometimes the court may order for reports, such as children's officers' reports. The interview of the minor by a children officer to generate the report has a negative psychological effect on them.Kendagor says solving children's cases through mediation saves time as it takes only 60 days to resolve a case. Secondly, it is cheaper in relation to litigation.“The cost of mediation for a party in any single case is free. Parties do not pay for filing case summaries. Neither do the parties pay the mediator. The government, through the Judiciary, pays the mediator for handling the case,” the registrar said.It also guarantees confidentiality in cases, which is vital for the children in those cases to be psychologically sound.Since 2019, 46 children's cases were referred for mediation at the Eldoret law courts, of which 17 have been fully resolved.The registrar called on lawyers to be more driven by love when it comes to children's cases and offer mediation as the first option to their clients.PARENTAL DEPRIVATIONPsychiatrist Dr Njagi Kumantha believes that what affects children's mental health is the separation of parents and not necessarily the court.The impact the separation will have on the children will depend on their age, he says.Children below seven depend more on their mothers, and separation will not have much effect if the court rules that they remain with the mother.The need for a peaceful solution to family disputes is something that is pushed for globally.For example, at international level, there is the international academy of collaborative professionals (IACP), which helps families come up with peaceful solutions rather than relying on courts.Anne Tamar-Mattis says the organisation helps families through a process that is peaceful, dignified and cooperative and that put children’s needs at the centre.IACP’s professionals work in teams that include lawyers, mental health professionals (coaches) and financial professionals, and the process is guided by the needs and values of the family with the goal of staying out of court.The organisation has trained thousands of professionals on every continent except Antarctica and continues to train professionals and grow the movement in new areas.The rise in divorce and separation cases during the Covid-19 pandemic is something that’s not unique to Kenyans.According to the BBC, separation and divorce cases have been on the rise across different countries of the world in 2020.BBC reported that leading British law firm Stewarts logged a 122 per cent increase in enquiries between July and October, compared with the same period last year.The BBC goes on to say that in the US, a major legal contract-creation site recently announced a 34 per cent rise in sales of its basic divorce agreement, with newlyweds who’d gotten married in the previous five months making up 20 per cent of sales.There’s been a similar pattern in China, which had one of the world’s strictest lockdowns at the start of the pandemic.Edited by T Jalio"
161,Philip Murgor: Why I'm the best successor to Maraga,"The name of former Director of Public Prosecutions Philip Murgor has been mentioned among frontrunners to succeed retired Chief Justice David Maraga.Others are Supreme Court Judges Smokin Wanjala, Njoki Ndung'u and Isaac Lenaola. Deputy Chief Justice and acting CJ Philomena Mwilu, Court of Appeal President William Ouko and former Attorney General Githu Muigai have also been mentioned.Murgor believes he is the best candidate to take over from where Maraga left.Why does he want to head the Judiciary?To negotiate, to talk with not at and to provide firm leadership. These are the inputs Murgor says he will bring to the table.He believes these are the areas where Maraga failed. The retired CJ's term was marked largely by a vicious acrimony with President Uhuru Kenyatta-led Executive.Murgor gives Maraga a score of 65 per cent. He believes the retired CJ scored fairly good at maintaining the rule of law and constitutionalism.Maraga often complained publicly about a meagre budget and the President's failure to appoint Court of Appeal judges to help clear the backlog of cases.Murgor however says the government is grappling with a hostile economic environment among many other pressures. As such, he says, Maraga ought to have been diplomatic in reaching out to the Executive.“I think Maraga lacked diplomatic skills in his leadership. Addressing the press to castigate and impute improper motive on the part of the duty bearers in government cut the leverages that he may have had to get things done,"" he said.Admitted to the bar in 1986, Murgor recently rose to the rank of senior counsel. The 60-year-old father of three is married to Court of Appeal judge Agnes Murgor.He told the Star that should he succeed in his bid to become the third Chief Justice under the 2010 Constitution, he will adopt budget cuts.“First, everybody and anybody knows that the country has been experiencing economic hardship for over two years now. As the CJ, I would start by appreciating this fact and inculcate it in my planning,” Murgor said.“Getting budgetary allocation requires negotiation and dialogue, not grandstanding.” On the matter of the 41 judges whose appointment has been approved by the Judicial Service Commission but stone-walled by the President, Murgor says he would go for a compromise rather than public agitation.For example, he said, instead of insisting that all the judges be sworn in, he would negotiate with the President to have it staggered, so that those with the alleged integrity questions are alienated from those whose names are clear.“This is compromise. You say, if I can’t get the whole thing because of whatever reason, then lets start with the less contentious ones,” he said.Murgor, however, said not only the CJ should carry the blame. ""The representatives of the Executive on the JSC, including the Attorney General failed.""“The AG Paul Kihara represents the Executive. He ought to have let the JSC in on the issues. But even larger than that, he should have led the negotiation efforts to develop a common ground.”The apparent refusal by Uhuru to appoint and swear-in the judges after their recruitment by the JSC formed a central part of the tiff between Maraga and the Executive.Barely a week after his retirement, Maraga called for the impeachment of the President for what he considered a gross violation of the Constitution in refusing to appoint the judges.Maraga also faulted the state for ignoring court orders.Murgor says most of the court orders allegedly ignored by the state were still subject of litigation and appeals.""The fact that you can sit here and do the interview, media operating freely and speech is not restricted, is enough testament of our democracy,"" he said.Murgor said he learnt the centrality of dialogue in getting things moving through the government bureaucracy when he served as the Director of Public Prosecutions.He was the DPP between 2003 and 2005 when his tenure was terminated by President Mwai Kibaki. At the time, he was handling high profile corruption cases, including the Anglo-Leasing scandal.He believes his dismissal was aimed at stopping him from pressing hard.Murgor remains proud of his anti-graft credentials. He believes it was because of his integrity that the Kibaki administration hired him to serve as the DPP even though he had served as part of President Daniel Moi's legal team in the 1992 elections.He says he moved on from the sacking. But two things remain; integrity and fair administration of justice. CORRUPTION IN THE JUDICIARYShould a CJ Murgor receive a call from a high-ranking Executive official or power brokers to decide a matter  - including a presidential election petition - in one way or another, he will politely decline.""If you are amenable to phone calls, then you will receive them. I'm not amenable to influence and doing others' bidding. That's why I got sacked as DPP,"" he said.Regarding corruption in the judiciary, Murgor believes the system is riddled with systemic graft but that ""a majority of sector players including judges and public servants are of high integrity and are not corrupt.""He said corruption in the corridors of justice is perpetuated by advocates who have formed cartels through which they intimidate judges and extract orders that they want.""These lawyers are well-known,"" he said, without giving names. To deal with them, he said, he would focus on implementing policies that smoke out the corrupt and ensure that only judges of integrity serve.He said ensuring that adequate judges are hired will help reduce backlog. Implementation of the  performance contract management mechanism introduced by Maraga will also help. Technology would also form the bulk of this strategy.""The Judiciary is one of the most efficient public institutions, thanks to the efforts by retired chief justices Maraga and [Willy] Mutunga,"" he said.Making it even better does not require any new invention. ""Mutunga brought one of the most brilliant reforms. My work would be to follow them through and implement them to the letter.""Murgor says he would also strive to make the JSC efficient in processing and dispensing with complaints against judges.""But most of the complaints against judges tend to be by losing litigants. But an efficient JSC would ensure such cases are dealt with quickly,"" he said. LSK SQUABBLES Ask to weigh in on the ongoing hostilities at the Law Society of Kenya, Murgor thinks the problem is with the leadership and that urgent steps were required to restore sanity at the outfit.Every sober lawyer is crest-fallen, he said, their heads down in shame at the conduct of the society's leadership.""The recent SGM where the one who could shout and abuse the loudest had their way was quite an embarrassment,"" Murgor said.The January 18 SGM presided over by president Nelson Havi was chaotic with tempers flaring. It was largely shambolic.It resulted in the suspension of eight council members but there are contestations as to whether the eight or the entire council membership were voted out of office.""My understanding is that the motion to suspend the eight was amended to include all of them. We have a mad president in Havi, who thinks he is law unto himself,"" Murgor said. Edited by P.O"
162,CS Maina risks being jailed for 6 months if convicted of contempt,"The High Court has been urged to find Industrialisation Cabinet Secretary Betty Maina in contempt for disobeying an order.Also sought is an order to commit her to a six-month jail term or compel her to pay a Sh500,000 fine for terminating the services of Bernard Ngore, an engineer, in defiance of the court.Ngore was appointed as the chairperson of the National Standards Council of the Kenya Bureau of Standards, but his services were terminated on December 9, 2020. He says every activity the board has undertaken in his absence is illegal because it was done contrary to a court order.""The National Standards Council cannot perform its core duties of setting standards in the country, approving the annual budget of the Bureau and performing its functions under sections 7 and 8 of the Standards Act. Any meeting or resolution arrived at without a legally and properly constituted NSC is invalid,"" Ngore says in suit papers.The Employment Court had issued an order on December 3, 2020, stopping the state from unlawfully terminating Ngore's services.According to suit papers, he served the order on the state agents. And immediately after being served with the order, he says, Maina and PS Francis Owino embarked on a sustained witch hunt, intimidation and overt breaches of the order.On December 9, the two wrote a letter making reference to the court order in question and used that as the basis for stopping him from discharging his duties as chairperson, he says.""The effect of the alleged contemnor letter dated December 9, 2020, is to circumvent the court order of December 3, 2020, by stopping me from performing my functions under the law,"" Ngore says.He wants the case to be certified as urgent.""The contemnors are in a deliberate path to frustrate the court orders, yet they have neither appealed nor applied to stay the same. The order sought is extremely urgent to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.""The CS is said to have sent a letter through PS Owino to Kebs indicating the need to have board meetings. And when the board meeting was called on January 1 and held on January 14, she and the PS requested email addresses for all other directors to send them virtual links but excluded Ngore."
163,Hustlers' march: Inside UDA's grand roadmap to 2022,"The United Democratic Alliance linked to Deputy President William Ruto plans to expand countrywide as it prepares  what insiders call 'a grand launch'.The party - touted as Ruto's 2022 State House vehicle and symbolised by a working man's wheelbarrow -  is to be formally unveiled in late February or early March. Ruto has said he would ditch the Jubilee Party if necessary but has recently defended President Uhuru Kenyatta from attacks by ODM boss Raila Odinga, Uhuru's handshake 'soulmate'.The launch would immediately be followed by the election of officials from the grassroots to the national level.Various candidates are jostling for political control as the legitimate  UDA officials.""An elaborate plan has been put in place to make the party the big thing in Kenya, UDA chairman Johnson Muthama told the Star on Monday.The ex-Machakos senator said despite the party having not been formally unveiled, “thousands of Kenyans are already queuing to be registered as members”.“We have succeeded in changing the name and already have our headquarters. Now we are  in Phase Two where we are set to open offices in all the subcounties and county headquarters,” he said.“From there, we will elect officials in all our branches to the top leadership. This is the party by the hustlers and for the hustlers and we want them to own and be part of every step and process of the decision-making  in the party,” Muthama said.UDA, formerly the Party of Development and Reform (PDR), which is in coalition with the Jubilee Party, is yet to be formally launched since it  underwent re-branding early this month.The Star has established the party that has taken the Jubilee strongholds by storm has 81,273 fresh applicants seeking to be enrolled.Most of them are said to be from Nairobi, Mt Kenya, Rift Valley, Northeastern, Eastern, Coast and parts of Ukambani, Western and Kisii  where Ruto enjoys sizeable support.Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu acknowledged her office lately has seen many people informing them of their resignation from one party and shift to another.She did not disclose if the migrants were moving from Jubilee to UDA.“We do have an increase in people changing parties. People resign from one party and join another every day. Resignations are all over now, maybe because of the several by-elections that have been scheduled by the IEBC,"" she told the Star by phone.The trouble-stricken ruling Jubilee Party has witnessed a falling out between President Kenyatta and DP Ruto, the party leader and deputy party leader, respectively.Muthama, a former close ally of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, said the one-month-old UDA has been received well countrywide.“The way UDA has been embraced across the country is a clear testament to how Kenyans are thirsting for vibrant national parties formed to serve the interests of wananchi. We will build our party that is democratic and run on the rule of law,” he said.Muthama said he hopes at at least three national parties would be formed by merging “the small tribal ones” ahead of the 2022 General Election.“It is our democratic right to have as many political parties as we wish but it is our prayer that we could have three national parties. That way, we will end tribal groupings and put in place parties that can only be differentiated by their ideologies and development agendas,"" he said.He is proposing that Raila Odinga’s ODM should team up with the Jubilee faction allied to President Kenyatta to form a huge party, while Ford- Kenya, ANC and Wiper would be merged.“Those tribal political parties cannot field a candidate outside their turf. We need national parties which when one forms that government, the other one can offer effective oversight as an alternative government. Not the situation we find ourselves in.” Muthama said.(Edited by V. Graham)"
164,Kiunjuri: I'm not bothered whether I'll be in government or opposition in 2022,"Former Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri says he is not bothered about whether he will be in government or the opposition after the 2022 General Election.Should he end up in the opposition, Kiunjuri says, he will ensure his Service Party of Kenya remains consistent in keeping the government of the day in check.“We shall be demanding for services from whoever will become the president because whether I will be in government or not, I will have a duty to do,” he said.He said even the opposition has a duty to demand for services from the government of the day and those in government have the duty to offer services to the people.“And therefore, I'm not afraid of where I will be. I will only be afraid if I will not articulate issues that are of concerns to Kenyans,” Kiunjuri said.Kiujuri spoke in Karatina, Nyeri county on Monday during the burial of Kelvin Muthee.He said the government should ensure the welfare of all Kenyans are taken care of saying it is meaningless to develop infrastructure when Kenyans are languishing in poverty.“If you build a superhighway from Marsabit to Nairobi, from Nairobi to Namanga and from Nairobi to Mombasa and the common man has nothing in their pockets and then you tell them about 50 years to come, where do you think they will be. Will they be there?” Kiunjuri asked.He called on Mt Kenya residents to speak in one voice and support people who will look into their welfare after President Uhuru Kenyatta retires.The TSP leader said the region must ask what is on the table for them before supporting any politician.""Mt Kenya will have a big say in determining who become the president and therefore must ask for their share of that government,"" he said.Kiunjuri said Kenyans should be concerned and deeply involved anytime crucial decisions such as that of the BBI or who becomes president are made.“The government in place is the one that determines how much you pay as taxes. So if you are less concerned, then there will come a government that will overtax you without delivering development,” he said.""It is the government in place that will ensure people get good prices for their farm products such as coffee tea and milk, rice and livestock.""Kiunjuri lashed out at former Prime Minister Raila Odinga for criticising President Uhuru Kenyatta in public rallies over unfulfilled promises.He wondered how Raila can criticise the President yet he is his handshake partner with whom they have worked in the government for the last three years.“The same people making promises all over the country are making the same promises they made 20 years ago and are the same they will make 40 years to come,” he said.Raila has often aimed his attacks at Ruto, keenly avoiding mentioning the President's name whenever he questions Jubilee's unfulfilled promises. Edited by P.O"
165,Uhuru plans Sagana meeting to tame Ruto wave,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has convened a crucial meeting with Mt Kenya leaders to resist DP William Ruto's hustler nation forays and revive the fortunes of BBI.The meeting on Saturday at the Sagana State Lodge in Nyeri follows  widening cracks among Mt Kenya politicians, threatening to sabotage the Building Bridges Initiative process.This weekend's meeting would help the President galvanise his support base as the BBI process enters the crucial stage after verification of signatures, paving the way for a referendum.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission could finalise the BBI signature verification before the President's Saturday meeting, ushering in referendum campaigns.On January 21, the IEBC published on its website for public scrutiny 1.33 million verified signatures in support of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment), Bill 2020 - the BBI bill.The IEBC deadline for voters to verify their details ended on Monday.This would be the first time the President will be stepping out forcefully since the BBI report was unveiled in October to ward off Deputy President Ruto's onslaught and fortify his Mt Kenya backyard.The resident has lately focused on persuading his restive backyard to embrace the BBI, maintaining the Central region is poised to reap major benefits if BBI is adopted despite palpable resistance.Nominated MP Maina Kamanda, an influential BBI proponent, confirmed leaders will be meeting this weekend.“I do not want to pre-empt the agenda of the meeting. It is the President himself who has convened the meeting and so all of us will attend and get to hear what the head of state will tell us,” the former Starehe MP told the Star.The meeting will bring together all elected leaders from all the Mt Kenya counties and those in the diaspora. The aim is to craft a strategy to undermine Ruto's hustler movement, which he says stands up for everyday men and women overlooked by government.The Star has established that parliamentary leaders from Mt Kenya led by National Assembly Majority leader Amos Kimunya and Deputy Majority Whip Maoka Maore on Monday held a strategy meeting with select leaders to draw up the list of attendees.Governors from the region will on Tuesday hold another meeting in Thika to harmonise the lists of MCAs and speakers of county assemblies who will attended the Saturday session.On Monday, Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu admitted there are genuine concerns of leaders from Mt Kenya that would be addressed during the meeting.“There is a need for us to sit down and synchronise the BBI campaigns for the region,” said Ngunjiri, the pioneer of Jubilee's Kieleweke faction that backs BBI.The vocal lawmaker appeared to expose issues roiling the BBI campaigns in the President's turf, insisting leaders must sit down and draw up a cascaded strategy to market BBI.“The reason why BBI is getting resistance is because of it being associated with 2022 politics,"" Ngunjiri said. ""My view is that politics is local and BBI campaigns should be steered by local leaders.”Speaking about the weekend meeting, Ngunjiri said the 'mukutano wa mdosi (the boss's meeting) will give leaders an opportunity to ventilate and agree on campaigns.When asked about the meeting by Maore, a key BBI proponent from Mt Kenya, remained cagey.“The agenda of the meeting is known by the convener but as leaders we will meet to discuss important issues affecting the region and do a follow up on the 2019 Sagana meeting,” he said without elaborating.Political activities in Mt Kenya  have reached fever pitch in the last few weeks as leaders and senior government officials have been holding preparatory meetings ahead of the President's meeting.Government officials co-chaired by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya and Interior PS Karanja Kibicho have been holding meetings to synchronise the region's development agenda.This is part of the President's plan to address the region's concerns that 'his people's' mainstays have collapsed under the Jubilee administration while businesses are limping.During another meeting with leaders from Mt Kenya at Sagana Lodge in November 2019, the President implored the leaders to back BBI proposals.However, like the 2019 meeting, some of Ruto's vocal allies from Mt Kenya said they were not aware of the scheduled meeting.The DP's Tangatanga movement has ramped up a ferocious anti-BBI narrative in Mt Kenya. It urges the region to reject the push to amend the Constitution, terming it a ploy by the 'dynasties' to retain power, despite what's good for the common man.The anti-BBI crusade in the President's backyard and the fears that the region could vote against the referendum have stung Uhuru into action to reverse situation.An opinion poll released by pollster Tifa last month revealed only 36 per cent of Uhuru's supporters will approve the amendments to the 2010 Constitution in a public vote.By contrast, 66 per cent of the supporters of ODM leader Raila Odinga, Uhuru's handshake partner and BBI compatriot, support the referendum push.The Star has established that part of the Sagana agenda will be to address jitters within the region triggered by strong objections to BBI teams picked recently to oversee campaigns in Mt Kenya.Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata and Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, hitherto fierce BBI defenders, are among leaders from the region who have called for a change of tack to salvage BBI fortunes.The supremacy tussles among Mt Kenya leaders, which have set back BBI's momentum, could overshadow the Saturday meeting where the President is expected to whip his lieutenants to work in harmony.Concerns have been raised that Uhuru has been losing his grip on his backyard. The anti-BBI wave that appears to be sweeping the region has been cited as a clear indication the President was not in control..Ruto, the second in command who fell out with the President over succession politics, has penetrated the Mt Kenya region. He enjoys considerable support as he leads the offensive against a contested BBI.Through his hustler nation empowerment programmes targeting the youth and women groups, the DP has maintained a formidable political war chest against his rivals, despite warnings he was hellbent on triggering a class war.(Edited by V.

166,ODM calls for probe into Sonko planned chaos confession,"The ODM party wants an inquiry into confessions by ex-Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko that the so-called deep state torched vehicles in 2017 to frame their protesting followers. In a statement to newsrooms, ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna said only a full inquiry will unearth the motives of such acts.Sifuna vowed the party will not rest until all individuals and institutions involved in the planning and execution of the criminal act are brought to the surface.The opposition party, which has been branded violent over the years, said it has been vindicated by Sonko’s confessions at the weekend.“The recent confession by the disgraced former Governor of Nairobi, Mike Sonko, that he participated in stage-managing violence and destruction of property that he and his co-conspirators then pinned on ODM, is welcome but amounts to too little too late,” Sifuna said in a statement.“ODM demands a full inquiry into the matter to establish the motives and extent of these mafia-like covert criminal acts as well as all persons and institutions involved.”Sonko claimed that during the demonstrations that followed the 2017 election, he and Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho printed ODM T-shirts and gave them to youths who then burned vehicles on Ngong Road to implicate the party.""In 2017 during ODM demonstrations, Kibicho, deep state, system and I printed  ODM T-shirts and then bought secondhand vehicles from showrooms and burnt them so people would say it's ODM, yet it was the deep state and the system),"" he said.Sonko was speaking on Sunday during Deputy President William Ruto’s rally in Dagoretti South, Nairobi.On Monday, Kibicho recorded a statement at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters over the allegations.Sifuna said ODM will continue to play by the rules in its quest for state power.“For a long time, our detractors have used and abused state power, mainstream and social media in a systematic attempt to depict our party as violent and purveyors of anarchy,” Sifuna said.“This view has been perpetuated despite our sincere efforts to communicate the truth—that it is the enemies of ODM that have authored, planned and executed these dirty schemes. We are slowly but surely being vindicated as the people behind these nefarious schemes slowly emerge from their dark hideouts, to confess their crimes.”"

168,State refutes claims it left Githunguri innovators in Sh3.5m debt,"The government has refuted claims it dupped two innovators from Githunguri, Kiambu county.The state on Monday said one of the entreprenuers who were to manufacture hospital beds had a criminal record.President's Delivery Unit Secretary Andrew Wakahiu said the government's intention to procure the locally manufactured hospital beds from the two entrepreneurs ran into headwinds after it emerged one of them was facing several criminal allegations.He said the revelations were made even as the visit to the workshop where the innovators claim to have been making and storing the beds that have left them wallowing in debts showed little activity with on a single ready bed.In July 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta gave a major boost to the two youthful innovators after he instructed the President's Delivery Unit to procure 500 beds from them.The beds that were to be made from locally sourced material from their workshop in Githunguri, Kiambu county, would then be subjected to standardisation tests by the Kenya Bureau of Standards.They were to play a vital aid to public hospitals that are reeling under the pressure of Covid-19 related hospital admissions.But according to Wakahiu, the government faced challenges processing the offer to procure the beds after obtaining intelligence that Mungai Gathogo was facing at least three cases related to fraud and obtaining money by pretense.Records at the Githunguri police station indicate that Gathogo had three pending criminal cases relating to obtaining money by false pretense and disappearance of a motor vehicle that he had hired.As soon as the government began the process of formalising the offer, a complaint was lodged claiming that Gathogo had conned a victim some Sh800,000.As a result, he was locked up in cells for three days until his father refunded the said amount.Wakahiu spoke on Monday when he visited the workshop.He said wrangles around the ownership of the firm that had claimed to have been behind the beds complicated the matter.""After we visited and we made the offer, vicious arguments on the control and management of the company between the two innovators and a man who claimed to be the real owner of the firm,"" he said.Wakahiu said the said owner claimed he had only contracted the duo to help market the beds.He said notwithstanding the issues, the government went out of its way to help the trio clear the debts they claimed they had incurred by offering to buy the entire stock of what was ready.""A lorry hired to ferry the beds the trio claimed to have already made was forced to return empty after it emerged there was no such goods despite Gathogo's oft-repeated claims in the media,"" Wakahiu said.Gathogo and his friend Joseph Muhinja had claimed that they have incurred a debt of Sh3.5 million after the state promised to buy locally manufactured beds from them.They said the amount had accrued after importing materials for the beds.""We came here prepared to buy all the beds and other materials these young men claim to have made regardless of the controversies around the firm ownership because we didn't want to ruin their lives by the debt,"" he said."
169,Corrupt Nairobi accountant to serve four years in jail or pay Sh1.5m fine,"A former deputy accountant with the Nairobi county rates department has been sentenced to four years in jail for corruptly soliciting Sh6 million from a businessman.Dennis Paul Manoti can alternatively pay a Sh1.5 million fine to avoid imprisonment. He is now expected to pay a fine of Sh1.25 million after he used his bail of Sh250,000 to partly cover the fine.Senior principal magistrate Felix Kombo of the Anti-Corruption Court in Milimani convicted Dennis Paul Manoti of two counts of corruptly soliciting for the money from Taj Mall owner Ramesh Chandra Govin to facilitate land transfer from Sigma Ltd to Taj Mall Ltd.Manoti was also found guilty and convicted of receiving a Sh100,000 bribe from Peter Kebaso to transfer the same property. The offence was committed on November 28, 2016, at City Hall.In his ruling, the magistrate noted that he had considered the mitigation by the accused person and the nature of the offence under the Economic Crimes Act. The prosecution treated Manoti as a first offender, saying there is no previous criminal record. “I hereby order the accused to pay a fine of Sh750,000 or serve two years in jail in respect of the first count. I also order him to pay a fine of Sh750,000 or serve two years in jail for the offence of receiving a bribe,"" Kombo ruled.Asked whether he will clear the fines, Manoti replied: ""Your honour, I cannot raise the fine, instead I will start serving a jail term.""Manoti had denied any wrongdoing. But the court had heard that Govin hired a private investigator to look into what was happening at the rates office after he was denied statements for the 4.2-acre plot where Taj Mall was built.According to the prosecution, Govin had been paying land rates to the county government from the time he bought the property in 2009."
170,Willie Kimani murder case adjourned for a second week,"The Willie Kimani murder case was on Monday adjourned for the second time. The case was mentioned for the second time in a row before Justice Daniel Ogembo who told the court that his colleague Judge Jessie Lessit was not feeling well.Judge Ogembo who had mentioned the case last week Monday said the case will be mentioned on February 1 before Lessit.The defence lawyers made an application for the accused persons to be presented in court on Friday this week so that they can access their lawyers.The court heard that due to the current Covid-19, it was tough to access the accused while in custody and that is why they are always brought to court to prepare for the case with the lawyers.Even though Ogembo allowed the application by the defence, he said on Friday this week the courts would be closed for fumigation.In December last year, the case failed to begin several times after defence lawyer Cliff Ombeta contracted coronavirus.So far, only one witness is yet to testify before the prosecution closes its case against the five suspectsWhen the case resumes, police officer Nicholas Olesena who had already testified will be cross-examined by Lawyer Ombeta and the other lawyers.In the case, four Administration Police officers Fredrick Leliman, Sylvia Wanjiru, Leonard Mwangi and Stephen Cheburet alongside police informer Ngugi were charged in 2016 with the murder of Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri.The victims' bodies were found afloat in River Ol Donyo Sabuk. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
171,Hope as Labour ministry meets health unions to unlock stalemate,"The Labour ministry on Monday resumed talks with striking health workers in an effort to end the prolonged strike in the sector.The strike, which kicked off on December 7, has seen health services in at least 34 counties paralysed, with patients forced to seek services in private facilities.The nurses, clinical officers and lab technologists went on strike to demand, among other things, risk allowance for frontline healthcare workers, comprehensive medical insurance cover, hiring of more healthcare workers and provision of quality and standard personal protective equipment.Kenya Union of Clinical Officers secretary general George Gibore said no progress has been made so far.“A lot of energy is in the courts and nothing else has materialised but I see we have been invited to the meeting with the Ministry of Labour in the afternoon,” Gibore said. The meetings resumed barely four days after the nurses union said they wanted the return-to-work deal signed at the national level.In a meeting by the Kenya National Union of Nurses’ governing council, it was agreed that the return-to-work formula that was negotiated at national level and agreed by the two levels of government must be signed at the national level.“As a result, all the negotiations that might be, have been or are yet to be initiated at the county government level are thereby stopped by the decree of the national governing council,” KNUN secretary-general Seth Panyako said.The unions and the multi-agency committee arrived at a conclusion after the talks between both parties, but the Council of Governors has remained adamant they will not sign the document.“We know what Kenyans are going through at this particular time and as a union it is not and has never and will never be our position to attain and have a position of grandstanding and not willing to engage,” Panyako said.The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims had called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to personally intervene in the healthcare crisis, adding that the Universal Health Coverage he initiated depends on the cooperation of health workers among other stakeholders in the sector.“The Muslim leadership is therefore hopeful that the crisis in the health sector will be addressed soonest so that the country can be better placed for the post-Covid-19 recovery,” Supkem acting national chairman Hassan Ole Naado said.“We are willing to assist in the mediation of this crisis if and when called upon,” he added.To date, 34 nurses, 14 doctors and 10 clinical officers have succumbed to the virus while on duty.Failure by the national and county governments to speak with one voice has been blamed for the prolonged strike in the health sector.A meeting between the two levels of government last Monday to hasten the signing of the agreement failed to take place, with Health CS Mutahi Kagwe leaving the matter to the counties to find a solution.Kagwe has maintained that as the parent ministry they agreed to be arbitrators and to engage both county governments and health workers to bring a harmonious working relationship, but have no intention of the taking roles of county government in accordance with the Constitution."
172,Koelel High school in Gilgil closed down over unrest,"The ongoing unrest in secondary schools across the country continued after students from Koelel High School in Gilgil went on rampage on Monday morning.The school located a couple of kilometres from Gilgil town had to be closed down indefinitely, with the students leaving a trail of destruction. They claimed that since they returned to school, entertainment had been banned making their life hard and boring. Some of the students lashed out at senior officers from the Ministry of Education for introducing a raft of measures which they termed as unattainable.One of the students said that since they reported back to school they had stopped socialising through sports and other forms of entertainment.He said life had become boring making students turn to immoral things like smoking bhang during their free time.“Our politicians are busy campaigning around the country but as students, we have not been allowed to meet for socialisation due to Covid-19 regulations and this is unfair,” he said.Gilgil subcounty commissioner Rebecca Muturi confirmed the incident, saying no one was injured as the students fled for home. “The school has been closed indefinitely after the students walked out to protest over lack of entertainment and we shall hold a meeting with the management over the incident,” she said.Secretary-general of the National Parents Association in Nakuru county Eskimos Kobia said the rising cases of school unrest was worrying.He said experience indicated that strikes started from walk-out to burning of classes and dormitories. “After staying home for over a year, it is definite that these students were affected and we should think about counselling them before they get more chaotic,” Kobia said. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"

174,"Girls sitting KCPE, KCSE to get free pads for three months","Female KCPE and KCSE exam candidates will be among 800,000 girls to benefit from free sanitary towels in the next three months.The other girls who will benefit are from slum areas and those falling below the poverty line.The provision of sanitary towels in schools is aimed at cushioning vulnerable schoolgirls from dropping out and absenteeism due to menstruation.Education CS George Magoha said this on Monday at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development where he flagged off sanitary towels donated to support 180,000 girls by the M-Pesa Foundation.“Today the M-Pesa Foundation has donated 540,000 sanitary towels to girls in urban slums and pockets of poverty across the country,"" the CS announced.He also noted that the donation would contribute to improved performance of girls and ensure their pride and dignity is raised.The Ministry of Education’s 2016 report revealed girls from poor families miss 20 per cent of school days in a year due to a lack of sanitary towels.The data indicated that a girl in primary school between Standard 6 and 8 can lose up to 18 weeks out of the 108 weeks, while those in high school can lose almost 24 weeks out of 144 weeks of learning. Various stakeholders argue that some  girls end up indulging in sexual activities to cater for the menstrual products and the effect is early marriages and teen pregnancies."
175,Kenya commited to global climate change adaptation - Uhuru,"Kenya has affirmed its commitment to implementing the global climate change adaptation initiatives.President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday said just like the current Covid-19 pandemic, climate change is a reality that the world must confront urgently.He said as a result, there is a need for concerted global efforts in addressing climate change.“Kenya commits to implement the adaptation action agenda but we can only succeed if we all as a global community collaborate in this noble endeavour,” he said.The head of state spoke on Monday evening at State House, Nairobi during a virtual high-level session of the Climate Adaptation Summit 2021.Uhuru emphasised that by pulling together the world will emerge stronger and more resilient from the dangers posed by climate change.“Indeed, we can expect to reap the triple dividends of reducing emissions, spurring economic growth and delivering social and environmental benefits,” he said.As he implored world leaders to rally behind efforts to upscale climate adaptation efforts, Uhuru identified agriculture as a top priority in Africa's climate change adaptation agenda saying a large percentage of the continent's population rely on the sector for its survival.The President said African farmers must be given the tools, information and financial support to enable them to embrace sustainable agricultural practices, respond to changing weather patterns and maximise productivity of their farmsHe said Kenya has upscaled its climate change adaptation efforts by mainstreaming the subject into its national development strategies.""Kenya is already experiencing the multi-fold climate impacts, including erratic rainfall, droughts and increased temperatures,"" he said.He added, ""To contain this situation, we have scaled up our adaptation efforts; mainstreaming it into our national development strategy"".The leaders who spoke during the summit were unanimous in their call for acceleration of climate adaptation efforts so as to safeguard communities from the harmful impacts of a changing climate.Among them was British  Prime Ministers Boris Johnson, India's  Narendra Modi (India), Evelyn Wever-Croes (Aruba) as well as United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and his predecessor Ban Ki-Moon.The meeting was hosted by Prime Minister Mark Rutte of The Netherlands."
176,Cofek calls for arrest of politicians behind Kapedo unrest,"The Consumer Federation of Kenya-Cofek - has called on Interior CS Fred Matiangi to ensure politicians behind Kapedo unrest are brought to book.The consumer protection agency said the decision by the CS to impose the 6pm to 8am curfew in the troubled Kapedo area is a major pain for the innocent locals.""Regrettably, it appears to be the only viable stop-gap measure. We hope that the CS will ensure that all political insiders are charged,"" the agency said.This comes after Matiang'i declared Kapedo - which is at the border of Turkana and Baringo counties - a 'disturbed zone' and imposed the 6pm to 6am curfew.He said the curfew is aimed at enhancing an ongoing security operation to address cases of insecurity that has claimed at least 10 lives in the last month alone.Matiang’i said the dusk to dawn curfew will be gazetted as part of efforts to address the menace.“We want to deal with the menace once and for all. We will have to deal with the criminals behind this issue who include leaders,” he said.Matiang'i had warned that the government would crack down on perpetrators including several political leaders.He said they had established that some of the politicians were behind the clashes that have adversely affected the locals.As a result, Tiaty MP William Kamket was arrested, questioned and released on a police bond over the clashes.Kamket was ordered by police to report to Nakuru DCI office on Monday.Police operations have been ongoing in the area and all indications show that the operations will be extended to try and curb the runaway insecurity in the region.On Thursday, two police officers were shot and killed in an ambush.The head of the Rapid Deployment Unit in Kapedo, who is a chief inspector, and his driver were in a lead lorry in a convoy of three vehicles when they came under attack at a bridge marking as a boundary between Turkana and Baringo counties.About 10 civilians have been killed there in the past month alone. It is the same place that a senior General Service Unit officer was Sunday shot and killed in another ambush.The officers were on the way from Nakuru with food for colleagues in a camp in the area when they came under attack at about 4pm.This is the second time in three years for the area to be declared a disturbed zone.The government had gazetted several places in the region as dangerous zones as part of efforts to manage the crisis of rustling and deaths.The decision in 2017 to gazette the areas as disturbed was arrived at after a series of consultations with the National Security Council.The places included Rumuruti, Ol Moran, Kirimon, Marmanet, Mukogodo East, Segera, Mithiga and Matuiku."
177,"Only 39 per cent of deaths reported last year, says state","The number of deaths that were recorded by the Department of Civil Registration Services in 2020 stands at 39 per cent.The department has termed the number as too low, noting that tens of deaths from Covid-19 last year could have gone unrecorded.To address this, the CRS, Ministry of Health and WHO have launched a Rapid Mortality Survey in six pilot counties to establish the number of deaths caused by the virus.The CRS has embarked on a training campaign targeting members of the provincial administration who record deaths at grassroots level.CRS secretary Janet Mucheru said the exact number of people who died in the country from the pandemic was not known.She noted that this was due to the low number of deaths reported last year, adding that the Rapid Mortality Survey would help resolve the issue.“Kenyans are slow in registering deaths and in 2020 only 39 per cent of mortality cases were recorded, meaning tens of deaths from other causes like Covid-19 could have been left out,” she said.Addressing the press in Lake Naivasha Resort where the training is going on, Mucheru said that the information would help in planning by updating the data.“This survey will help us know the impact of Covid-19 based on one county to the other and also indicate the top killer diseases in the country,” she said.On births, Mucheru noted that their registration was on the rise at 80 per cent unlike deaths as a birth certificates are needed in schools and while acquiring an ID.Senior deputy director of medical services Dr David Soti admitted that the current number of Covid-19 deaths could be higher compared to what was released on a daily basis.“The mortality data released by the ministry on a daily basis is based on reports from health centres while those from the grassroots have not been captured,” he said.He noted that as per data from the ministry, the number of patients who visited hospitals in 2020 dropped to the lowest ever due to the crisis caused by the pandemic.“In 2020, the number of patients to hospital dropped sharply and we also had tens of deaths in the grassroots areas that went unreported,” he said.Soti noted that the Rapid Mortality Survey would help them in their planning, adding that the mortality data would help the ministry in strengthening their systems.On his part, David Otieno from WHO said that they were working closely with the Department of Civil Registration Services and senior government officers.“WHO is funding this survey exercise in six counties which seeks to get the latest mortality data which has been missing for some period,” he said."
178,Company charged with Anglo Leasing contract incorporated at British Virgin Islands,"Documents obtained from the British government helped Kenyan detectives unravel who the directors of a firm linked to the Sh3.5 billion Anglo Leasing scandal were, a Nairobi Court heard on Monday.   Ethics and Anti-Corruption commission (EACC) Lead Investigator Ignatius Wekesa told Magistrate Felix Kombo that the documentation revealed the directors of Sound Day Corporation to be Chamanlal Kamani, Rashmi and Deepak Kamani. The Kenyan government had entered into a contract with the said company incorporated at the British Virgin Islands to supply police security equipment.  Sound Day and Apex Finance Corporation are some of the companies that have been linked to the Anglo leasing scam. Wekesa on Monday said he will be demonstrating why companies are incorporated in BV islands to get exemptions from financial statements. The last time Wekesa was in court, he took through Magistrate Felix Kombo the evidence they received from Switzerland showing the directors and beneficiaries of Apex. He said as at 2008, they were not able to trace where the two firms were incorporated. On Monday Wekesa ran the court through documents they obtained from the British government through Mutual Legal assistance. The documents were in relation to the entity that entered into the multi billion contract of modernization of police security equipment. “We had sought information on Sound Day corporation locally but it was very scanty. We also interviewed the government officials who participated or facilitated the contract at the office of the President  but Information however was not coming out clearly to say who the director of the corporation was,” he said.  He said just like for the apex finance corporation, what they were getting in the course of their investigations is that the Kamani’s were linked to it. In the MLA, the Kenyan investigating team had asked British to help them acquire documents relating to the relationship between Sound Day corporation and apex finance in Geneva. They also wanted them to verify the addresses used when entering the contracts and beneficial owners of both corporations. Also requested were banking records and identities of beneficiaries of funds to whom the money was paid to by the Kenya government. “We needed to also establish whether Sound Day is a valid corporation in the UK. We also sought to know the real directors of Sound Day”  he said.    Londons PSJ Alexander and company chartered accountants are the ones who provided most of the documentation as far as sound Day corporation is concerned.  Information sought revealed that Sound Day was incorporated on 21 September 1989 at the British Virgin Islands and that the Kamani’s were the directors of the firm having taken over from one Collins Foster in 1990.   He also mentioned Hallmark international, Saagar and Kamsons are associated with the Kamani’s.   In the case, Chamanlal Kimani, Deepak Kimani, Rashmi Kamani, PSs Joseph Magari, Dave Mwangi and David Onyonka  are facing charges of conspiracy to defraud the government Sh3.5 billion in the Anglo-Leasing contract known as modernization of police security equipment and accessories."

180,Police still in my compound despite court order - Wine,"The Ugandan High Court issued an order on Monday barring the military from surrounding the home of the main opposition leader, Bobi wine.The police have been camping outside Robert Kyagulanyi’s home in Kampala for 11 days.The siege started on January 14, 2021, when the country held its general election where Wine was seeking to unseat President Yoweri Museveni.But despite the court order, Wine claimed through his Twitter account that the police were still in his home, hours after the ruling.“The High Court ruled this morning that my continued house arrest (11 days now) is illegal and unconstitutional. Several hours later, the military still surrounds my home, blocking access to all,” Bobi Wine said.Last week, the singer-turned politician posted that he was running out of basic commodities since he and his family are unable to move out of the house, which he said is surrounded by the military.According to the electoral commission, Museveni won 5.85 million votes, equal to 58.6 per cent, as Wine had 3.48 million votes, 34.8 per cent of the votes cast.Wine had claimed that the election was marred by irregularities in favour of the incumbent, but he is yet to prove his claims."

186,"Kenyans to blame as matatus carry excess passengers, hike fares","We might blame the matatus for their behaviour in containing Covid-19 but the real problem is with us the passengers. We are our own enemy. As I board and sit quietly in a matatu, I notice a sign on the seat on my right written 'Do not seat here'.As a law-abiding citizen, I obey the wordings and what the Health ministry had laid down when the first case was announced in Kenya on March 13, 2020.As a matter of social distancing and because I know how our touts behave, I take my backpack and put it in the seat on my right. This makes me sit a bit closer to the person on my left but the one-metre rule still applies. As the matatu leaves a packed town with passengers stranded, the tout says we have to pay Sh100 bob for our destination.Although curfews (10:00 pm to 4:00 am) — which cut into the bus operating hours, combined with additional sanitary expenses have also greatly impacted matatu revenues, the government warned against increasing bus fares.But on reaching the Westlands area near Spring Valley Police Station, the matatu stops to pick some passengers who had been waiting there for a while. ""Madam songa, "" the male passenger who is not even wearing a mask tells me as he looks at my bag 'seated' at the empty seat. Looking at him without blinking as a show of sternness, I ask him "" nisonge wapi? Unaona kiti hapa?"".But this comment angers him. He then resorts to taking a back seat where some two sisters had sat apart. This makes them three at the back but because he was with his friend, he starts prompting him to sit next to me.""Marto, si uambie huyu dem akusongee. Hakuna haja ya kukaa hapo na konda na kuna space hapa,"" he says as he eats his sugar cane bought on the side of the road. All this time, the matatu is already packed apart from where I sit and in the front row where the driver sits. ""Sisongii. Na hakuna mahali utanipeleka. Hii virusi kama wewe hauogopi mimi siitaki. And please stop pestering me. Nafuata sheria,"" I retort with anger in my voice. But this comment even made things harder for me. Passengers started complaining about my insensitivity at people stranded during rush hour. "" Huyu dem anadhani ako special. Sasa sisi tumekaa na watu na hatujawahi kufa. Madam songa,"" I heard a voice right behind me. The murmurs kept renting the air with some even diverting to their own language to ensure that I don't understand whatever they are saying. But I was certain they were talking about me since they kept looking at me in a strange manner. As they ganged on me, I realised that people are their own enemies.  I told myself that if I continue with this conversation, a fight might just erupt.It is at that point that I took my earphone, crossed my legs and prayed that I would reach home safely without any more murmurs and tension.Psychologist Liz Gichimu tells the Star that people have different opinions on matters Covid-19.“One of the things we have established is that people have varied opinions and views. There are people who believe that this thing is a hoax and some believe it's real,” she said.“There are a lot of dynamics of how people react. As time goes by, these are the same people who will want to get into a matatu that is already full.”Gichimu says that these behaviours are based on the way they are informed about the disease.“Then there are these people who don’t agree with a matatu carrying excess. In fact, these are the people who don’t allow passengers to sit next to them. I would not say that it is selfish behaviour. it’s just self-preservation,” she said.“According to nature, people tend to behave in a manner that they think will benefit them and this is one way.”Matatu Welfare Association chairman Dickson Mbugua said that carrying excess passengers is uncontrollable.“You know with 60 per cent off, people are not able to sustain themselves. So they go an extra mile of carrying excess passengers. It is illegal but at times it goes beyond comprehension,” he said.Speaking to the Star on Monday, Mbugua said if only the matatu’s would be allowed to carry the capacity they used to, nothing of the sought would occur.“If we go back to capacity, matatu will not hike the fares. And the excess money they get from the passengers do not reach the owner of the vehicle,” he said.“....but the owner is aware of the hiked fare.”As a way forward, Mbugua said the government should allow matatu to go back to their normal capacity.“ ..if they allow it in the commuter trains, SGR, they should allow it in the PSV."""

It is a good thing for all Kenyans. The book is huge and has a lot of issues. They are publishing a summarised version,” Raila said in an interview with Kameme FM on Monday.The ODM leader persuaded Mt Kenya to get to know the truth about the BBI report to make an informed decision on the same.Raila dangled the carrots in the BBI saying it had better tidings for the youth, women, and common mwananchi.The former premier further dismissed the notion that the proposed Constitutional changes to bring in a Prime Minister and two deputies will increase the cost of running government.“What we are proposing will be much cheaper compared with today since ministers will come from parliament and will only earn allowances for the additional job,” Raila said."

Stop talking to him in rallies,” he said.The DP asked Raila to telephone or pay a visit to the President, whom he been calling his brother, and tell him about the government’s failure instead of humiliating him in public.He spoke at Kenya Assemblies of God in Dagoretti South where he attended a church service on Sunday.“You are saying Uhuru is your brother, why are you embarrassing him in public saying the government has not done this or that?” he said.The ODM leader has been attacking Ruto for attempting to run away from the failures of Jubilee administration.In particular, Raila has asked him to take responsibly for Jubilee's failure to deliver laptops for learners, build stadia among other promises the administration promised the electorate.Raila’s attack came after Ruto and his allies appear to run away from Jubilee failures by accusing him (Raila) of infiltrating the government and preoccupying it with handshake and the BBI thus derailing its development agenda.But Ruto defended the government’s record and assailed Raila for blocking the government’s agenda.“The government of Uhuru and Ruto has built a railway line from Mombasa to Naivasha, almost 700km. We have built roads 7500km, connected electrify to five million Kenyans, and built technical training institutes,” he said.The DP criticised Raila for engaging in petty politics, adding that he had played a central role in derailing Jubilee’s development programmes through the handshake.“He changed our priorities from jobs creation to the review of the Constitution. He should accept he has been part of the failure,"" he reckoned.Ruto reiterated that the hustler movement was unstoppable despite criticism that the narrative was fanning a class war that could be detrimental to the country.He argued that the narrative is about empowering ordinary Kenyans who struggle to put food on the table for their families, and instead attacked those criticising it as practising politics of tribalism.“Let nobody threaten you that hustler is about dividing people. I want to tell you that these people we have outclassed them. They are the ones dividing the people by fanning politics of tribe and positions,” he said.Ruto was accompanied by MPs Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), John Kiarie (Dagoretti South), Wangui Ngirici (Kirinyaga), George Theuri (Embakasi West), Didmus Barasa (Kimilili).Others were John Paul Mwirigi (Igembe South), Eric Muchangi (Runyenjes), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho), Nixon Korir (Lang’ata),  James Gakuya (Embakasi North) and former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.Senator Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), Soipan Tuya (Narok), Benjamin Gathiru (Embakasi Central), Florence Jematia (EALA), Beatrice Nkatha (Tharaka Nithi), George Kariuki (Ndia), Mathias Robi (Kuria West), Gideon Keter (nominated), David Ole Sankok (nominated), Margaret Wanjiru (former Starehe MP) and Omingo Magara (PDP party leader) were also present.They scathingly attacked Raila, accusing him of derailing the government's development agenda and that he should take responsibility for Jubilee's failures.Gachagua challenged Raila to be bold enough and face President Kenyatta instead of the roadside attacks.“You said you are also a President because you were sworn in. So, what stops you from posing serious questions on the said government failures to the President Kenyatta?” he asked. “Odinga should stop abusing the President. Instead, he should share his three-year scorecard with Kenyans when he was in the government,” Murkomen said."
193,KDF to buy 118 top military vehicles to fight al Shabaab,"The Department of Defence is set to procure 118 Armored Personnel Carriers from Turkey.The move is aimed at ensuring maximum survivability of its troops as they tackle the al Shabaab militia in Somalia.KDF Spokesperson Col Zipporah Kioko told the Star DoD is finalising the deal with a Turkish firm to bring in the 118 high-performance APCs.Kioko told the Star that the deal is at an advanced stage and that procurement of the APCs was on a need basis to provide protective mobility for troops wherever they are deployed.The Star has established that it will cost the taxpayer an estimated Sh7.7 billion for the government to purchase the more than 118 APCs through the Export Credit Agency.The current APC fleet in the KDF consists of Puma M26-15, WMZ 551BSI, Mamba MK5, Bastion and CS/VP 14, all introduced into service between 2010 and 2019.All of them have been deployed in the country and in Somalia to address security threats but a significant number has been rendered inoperable due to the changing threat environment.""The Kenya Army thus made a critical assessment and established that the contemporary operating environment has evolved significantly with major threats to the APCs being Vehicle Borne IEDs (VBIEDs), directional IEDs and IEDs reinforced with complex ambushes,"" Kioko said.She said as a result, they developed User Specifications Requirements (USSR) that integrate higher levels of force protection which guided the procurement of the HIZIR 4x4 Tactical Wheeled Armoured Vehicle.The acquisition was cleared by DoD’s procurement board meeting after it approved the sourcing of the HIZIR Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAPs) Armored Personnel Carriers (APC).Three firms had applied for the tender but only the Turkish firm Katmerciler HIZIR met the user specifications.The two other firms are from South Africa and North America respectively.The Katmerciler HIZIR is a 4x4 Tactical Wheeled Armoured Vehicle designed and optimised for high performance under extreme operational conditions.The APC has a proven track record in Syria where the Turkey forces operate and face similar threats as KDF troops face in Somalia.The vehicle has a high level of ballistic and mine protection. It is agile, dynamic, versatile, low maintenance and easy care platform. It was unveiled in unveiled in November 2016 by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at the 3rd High-Tech Port expo of Turkey’s Independent Industrialists’ and Businessmen’s Association (MUSIAD).Tested in the Netherlands and certified by NATO, the vehicles can be used in various configurations such as combat vehicle, command control vehicle, CBRN vehicle, weapon carrier (easy integration of various weapon systems), ambulance vehicle, border security vehicle and reconnaissance vehicle.The HIZIR is fitted with a Turkish-made ASELSAN SARP turret which provides a perfect match for integration onto tactical vehicles, fixed surveillance posts, towers and critical infrastructures.Depending on the operational requirements, SARP can be equipped with 12.7mm machine gun, 40mm automatic grenade launcher or 7.62mm machine gun.The SARP turret has advanced capabilities and options such as Fire-on-the-move capability, Day and night imaging, automatic target tracking, Laser Range Finder for accurate ballistics, Last round warning and Manuel back-up.The conventional Hizir has 9 gun ports.The vehicle is also equipped with a smoke grenade launcher on the top of the vehicle.The Katmerciler HIZIR can carry a total of 9 personnel with the driver and commander at the front and 7 people at the rear on individual seats. The engine is located at the front of the vehicle.However, the vehicle will deviate from this as it is to be modified to meet the Kenya Army specifications.Al Shabaab's primary goal in Somalia is to topple the government of the day and establish an Islamic emirate within the country guided by a strict reading of Shariah law.The group’s first leader, Aden Hashi Ayro, received training in Afghanistan, and he modeled Al Shabaab's principles after those of the Taliban.According to the Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC), the group has carried out punishments such as amputating the hands of thieves and stoning women accused of adultery in territories under its control.The group also bans items and activities such as music, videos, shaving, and bras.Al Shabaab opposes the presence of foreign troops in Somalia, chiefly the African Union’s peacekeeping mission, known as AMISOM, which is supported by the United Nations and European Union. As part of its quest to establish a Somali state based on Islamist principles, Al Shabaab seeks to dislodge AMISOM and other foreign military interventions from the country.In addition to its domestic goals, Al Shabaab has increasingly framed the Somali civil war as part of a global jihadi movement.Al Shabaab has launched international attacks, including in Kenya and Uganda, and it has issued threats against other countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.They began operations in 2006 in Mogadishu as a splinter group of the Islamic Courts Union-ICUIN 2014, the group was said to have between 7,000 and 9,000 militants.The Kenya Defence Forces troops in Somalia have lost dozens of its soldiers to the militia.The group is fighting hard to be ahead of the troops in terms of weaponry and ammunition.But the HIZIR is designed on a V-hull monocoque chassis to increase vehicle and crew survivability by deflecting an upward directed blast from a landmine or IEDs (Improvised Explosive Device) away from the vehicle.All the windows of the vehicle are built to withstand the firing of small arms 7.62mm machine gun and hand grenade fragments.The Katmerciler HIZIR is powered by a Cummins ISL turbocharged 6 cylinders inter-cooled diesel engine which has a displacement of 8.9 liters and develops 400 hp (298 KW) at 2100 rpm.It has a maximum speed of 110 km/h and a range of 700 km. The vehicle has fully Independent Suspension with Coil Spring and Shock Absorber.Recovery Winch, Gun Turret, Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS), Spare wheel, CBRN Air Filter System, Automatic Fire Suppression System, Intercom System, GPS Navigation.The Hızır has attracted a great deal of attention as a tactical wheeled armored combat vehicle with the most powerful engine in its class in the Turkish defense industry.Katmerciler was established in the year 1985 and is an innovative, pioneer and leader company of the vehicle-top-equipment sector in Turkey with an experience of more than 30 years.Having the widest range of products in its sector with the production of approximately 30 different equipment certified with quality certificates, the Company carries out turnkey production under a single roof.Within the product range, designs and productions of Fire Trucks, Environmental Vehicles, Transportation Vehicles, Defense Specific Vehicles, Construction Specific Vehicles and Special Products take place.Among these products, there are various vehicle-top-equipment having diverse functions to ease the life from the fire trucks to garbage truck, from vacuum truck to channel opening vehicles, from tankers to rescue vehicles and from dampers to mobile maintenance vehicles.The company also produces riot control vehicles (TOMA) with its ability of production based on the state-of-art technology.Katmerciler does business with the automotive giants in the world such as Ford, BMC, Hyundai, Isuzu, Iveco, MAN, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, Renault, Scania and Volvo for the production of vehicle-top-equipment."
194,"Oparanya, Joho to battle with Raila for ODM presidential ticket","ODM leader Raila Odinga could face Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho in the battle for the party's 2022 presidential ticket.On Sunday, National Elections Board chair Catherine Mumma placed an advert asking interested candidates to pay Sh1 million non-refundable fee to participate in the nominations.The party's nominations, expected by February next year, would have the potential of putting behind the sting of the 2017 electoral defeat and getting on the launch pad for the 2022 presidential race.Applicants have up to 26th of next month to submit their applications.The entry of Oparanya and Joho —  ODM's co-deputy party leaders— has raised the stakes in the contest for the coveted presidential ticket and opened a new battle front for what appears to be ODM's biggest assignment.From the onset, the contest for the ODM presidential flagbearer could appear an ordinary contest but deeper lie political undercurrents with huge implications on Raila's future career.Opponents seeking to influence the outcome of presidential nominations of rival parties could be the biggest worry for the rank and file of ODM in its bid to hand a third straight ticket to a flagbearer.On Sunday, Oparanya declared that he will throw his hat in the ring to seek the ODM ticket in a battle that will pit him against his boss, Raila, in a bid to get a formidable candidate to take on Deputy President William Ruto.“I will submit my nomination papers to seek the ODM ticket for the 2022 presidential race,” Oparanya told the Star.The outgoing Council of Governors chairman revealed that he is not scared of Raila's domineering personality within the ODM party, saying he was ready to fight it out with whoever was running.“For now, I don't know if he [Raila] is going to be my challenger for the ticket, but if he decides to run, then let delegates decide at the ballot,” Oparanya said.While Joho was not available for confirmation, his close ally told the Star the governor will be seeking the ODM ticket to run for president.“Definitely is he is in,” the ally said in reference to Joho's intention to run.Raila unsuccessfully flew the presidential flag in 2007, 2013 and 2017 handing ODM consecutive defeats at the hands of Mwai Kibaki and President Uhuru Kenyatta.Other sources, however, said the move by the ODM Central Management Committee to okay the competition could be a game plan to consolidate Raila's support bases.Raila's bastions at the Coast and Western Kenya have been restive amid inroads  from DP Ruto whose efforts to court the regions have seen him win over key politicians.The battle for the ODM presidential ticket could rekindle the 2007 memories when Raila defeated pentagon compatriots Ruto, Musalia Mudavadi, Joe Nyaga and Najib Balala to clinch the presidential ticket.In 2012, Musalia bolted from the Orange party, claiming the party constitution made it mandatory the party leader was the automatic presidential candidate. The clause was removed. Analysts say once more ODM has a date with destiny that would mark the turning point for the party; either towards oblivion, or a springboard from which a formidable 2022 vehicle could emerge.This would mean that ODM delegates and party leaders would have a choice to either wield a knife with which they will slice the Orange into pieces or nurture seeds for the Orange to further flourish.On Sunday, ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna said the party's presidential nomination was an indication of its democratic credentials.“It is only ODM that follows democratic provisions to put in place processes that are free and fair for all,” Sifuna said, dismissing rival parties as lacking structures and systems that can guarantee fair competition.Sifuna said even those  seeking Raila's endorsement for the presidency and are not ODM members have a window of opportunity“Those who know that they can't win the presidency without Raila's support must now apply. If Raila was to support anyone then that person must be within ODM, this is the opportunity for them to join ODM,” Sifuna said in apparent reference to ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka.At least 3,954 delegates drawn drawn from the sub-branches (constituencies) and branches(counties) will take a vote to elected the ODM presidential candidate next year.Each of the 290 constituencies, according to the ODM constitution, is represented by eight delegates with at least three of them being women while every county sends to the NDC 20 delegates.This brings the total number of delegates to about 3,260 who will be eligible to pick the presidential candidate at the National Delegates Convention.The next few months will witness a scramble for the delegates with hopefuls likely to start countrywide tours to woo the voters ahead of the NDC.“In Western Kenya we have a good number of delagates. That tells you I have somewhere to start from, we will then traverse the country to campaign among delegates,” Oparanya told the Star.Ironically, Ruto's Rift Valley turf which enjoys the highest number of counties and constituencies (14 and 54 respectively) brings the number of delegates from the region to 712.Second in terms of voting strength is Nyanza region with 456 voters at the NDC. The region is ODM’s stronghold given that it is the party leader’s home.The region has six counties and 42 constituencies.Third is Eastern, which includes Ukambani with 444 delegates. The region has seven counties and 38 sub-branches.Central region has five counties and 34 constituencies with 372  delegates.Oparanya's Western Kenya region has 344 while Joho's Coast bastion has got 326 delegates, North Eastern 204 while Nairobi has 156 delegates.Non-ODM strongholds might present the trickiest loyalty for the party as rivals could use them to infiltrate the NDC so as to alter the outcome with an aim of installing a weaker candidate."
195,"Uhuru, health workers are heroes of 2020 - Infotrak","Health workers and President Uhuru Kenyatta are the heroes of 2020 as police and Parliament rated the worst performers.This even as most Kenyans indict the Jubilee administration’s handling of the economy as they decry the lifting of the Covid 19 tax reliefs by the government.In a poll released by research firm, Infrotrak, nearly half of Kenyans feel the government‘s performance on handling the global pandemic was average.According to the polls released on Sunday, health were rated the best performers with a mean score of 76 per cent, followed by the media at 72 per cent, with religious organisations (65 per cent) and the President (63 per cent) coming third and fourth respectively.It shows that 42 per cent of Kenyans feel health workers were the heroes of 2020, with 12 per cent of the sampled population saying President Uhuru was their hero.Eleven per cent of Kenyans, according to the poll, feel the Ministry of Health was their hero with 10 per cent saying Deputy President William Ruto was the hero.And in what could send the government back to the drawing board, nearly two-thirds of Kenyans feel the reversal of the Covid 19 tax reliefs was not well throughout out.A similar per cent age feel the government did not do well in running the economy to with 30 per cent saying the government did well.The polls shows that 45 per cent of the population rated police as the worst performers during the year followed by the National Assembly (39 per cent), Senate (35 per cent) and county governments (31 per cent).The research was conducted between December 27 and 29 last year. Some 800 respondents aged 18 years and above were sampled across 24 counties.They were interviewed though computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI). It has a margin of error of + or – 3.5 per cent at 95 per cent degree of confidence."
196,"Power lines are killing migratory birds, experts say","Experts have now pointed to tens of power lines passing through national parks as the cause of death to hundreds of migratory birds.They identified flamingoes and vultures as the most affected by the power lines mainly around Lake Elementaita in Gilgil and Hells Gate National Park.Currently, engineers from Ketraco are involved in constructing the Sh8 billion Olkaria-Lessos-Kisumu power line which passes through various parks including Hells Gate.An old electricity line from Olkaria to Suswa power station has been blamed for the current crisis, which has seen tens of flamingos killed in the last couple of months.Francis Muthui, the chairman of Friends of Lake Naivasha, said the electricity projects were critical to the country and its economy.He was, however, quick to note that the power lines had turned out to be death traps for birds mainly flamingoes and vultures.Muthui noted that the power lines had been constructed on the flamingo route, a move that had adversely affected their migration patterns.“In the last couple of months we have lost tens of flamingoes that were flying from Lake Natron to Lake Oloiden in Naivasha. They were electrocuted,” he said.He added that tens of vultures from the park were also in great danger due to an increase in the number of power lines criss-crossing the park.However, a senior engineer from Kenya Electricity Transmission Company who declined to be named denied that the power cables were a threat to the birds.He noted that the cables had been fitted with bird diverters, which are devices fitted on the wires to distract the birds away from the lines.“Before this project kicked off, an environmental impact assessment was done and approved by Nema and these power cables are not responsible for the deaths of the birds,” he said.Speaking earlier during the International Vulture Awareness Day, bird expert Silas Wanjala said vultures in Hells Gate park could disappear in the next 20 years.Wanjala said that noise pollution, the new power lines, human activity and brine from the geothermal wells had adversely affected the breeding areas.“Currently, Hells Gate is the only protected breeding ground for various species of vultures but with ongoing works on geothermal drilling their habitat is affected,” he said.  Edited by Henry Makori"
197,"Farmers have delivered 26,000 bags of maize to NCPB","Delivery of maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board started rising in the last week after the board increased the price of a bag of maize.NCPB managing director Joseph Kimote said so far farmers have delivered 26, 000 bags of 90kg to various stores in the North Rift region.He said farmers were initially reluctant to deliver maize to the board because others were offering a better price.“But the momentum has started picking since we increased the price of a 90kg bag of maize from Sh2,500 to Sh2,700 a week ago,” he told the Star on Friday in an interview.Kimote said the increase was aimed at ensuring that the board is at par with what the market is offering and due to the market dynamics.Millers and traders are currently offering between Sh2,650 and Sh2,700 per bag.“The government directive was to ensure minimum maize purchasing prices remain at Sh2,500. We can still go up and we have that flexibility.  We wanted to align to what the market wants,” he said.He assured farmers payment will be made within 24 hours of delivery as he confirmed that farmers who are owed money by the board for the 2017-18 maize delivery will start receiving payments this week.Kimote said the board has been verifying bank accounts of the farmers who were cleared by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, and that the money will be channeled to their bank accounts.On January 11, NCPB announced that it will be paying pending bills for the 2017-18 maize deliveries to farmers who were cleared by the EACC.Kimote said the board will be paying close to Sh500 million to farmers who were under investigation.He said for the last two weeks, the board has been working on the modalities of how to disburse the money to the farmers as well as verifying bank accounts where the payment will be made.In 2018, the country was hit by a maize scandal after unscrupulous traders benefited from maize payments at the expense of genuine farmers.""NCPB has received Sh147 million from the government to pay the first batch of 68 farmers who have been cleared by the EACC. The board is expecting a further Sh384 million to pay the remaining 21 farmers,” said Kimote.He assured farmers who deliver grain that meets the required quality standards that they will be paid promptly.Edited by Henry Makori"

201,Yatani threatens to sue politicians indefamation claims,"Treasury CS Ukur Yatani yesterday threatened to sue three politicians from Marsabit and Isiolo if they failed to apologise within 48 hours. The CS alleged the three made defamatory remarks against him on Monday last week.  Ukur, through G&A Advocates, wants Isiolo Woman Representative Rehema Dida Jaldesa, Saku MP Dido Ali Raso and Qalicho Gufu Wario of Moyale to apologise and retract the statements.“Unless an unconditional apology is made to our client together with an unqualified retraction of all defamatory statements within the next 48 hours. We have firm instructions to file court proceedings against you,” the demand letters read.The CS says the unconditional apology should achieve similar prominence as the offending statements made against him.The three, according to the CS, uttered false words with the clear intention of damaging his reputation.The offending statements, he says, insinuate that he is involved in planning and mobilising a strategy to displace the Borana community from Isiolo and Marsabit.“Such false allegations are capable of being understood that our client has committed crimes under domestic and international law, including purported forcible transfer of population, fanning violence, cattle rustling, theft and other felonies.”He says the uttered words falsely insinuate that he has conspired with other leaders and the government to orchestrate violence and attacks within the Isiolo and Marsabit counties.“The natural implication of that allegation is that my client is responsible for the alleged insecurity across the region. That allegation is clearly designed to sully my clients image.”According to the letters, the offending statements have been extensively circulated through social media platforms and blogs that enjoy global reach and coverage.Ukur claims the action by the leaders is not an isolated attack but has been a sustained malicious trend since he was nominated CS.“Since those statements were made, our client has been the subject of spite, public odium and is now treated with suspicion by many government officials as well as individuals and groups that previously respected and regarded him highly,” reads the letter.“As a result of the deliberate scheme to malign his reputation, our client has suffered and stands to suffer even more loss and damage to his personal reputation and standing both as a state officer and within the community due to his wrongful actions.”"
202,"Nyanza irrigation to expand by 37,700 acres, says PS Irungu","The government will expand irrigation projects in Nyanza by another 37,700 acres.Water, Sanitation and Irrigation Principal Secretary Joseph Irungu said the targeted areas include West Kano schemes, Ahero Irrigation schemes, Lower Kuja and Nzoia.In Kisumu, the government through the National Irrigation Authority (NIA) will spend Sh270 million for expansion in West Kano.The expansion, Irungu said, is geared towards attaining food sufficiency as envisaged in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda.Irungu said the government has so far put 500,000 acres under irrigation (27 per cent) against the capacity of 1.9 million acres of land countrywide.He expressed confidence that the government will achieve 700, 000 acres of land under irrigation by 2022, and 1.4 million acres across the country by 2030.This comes as the multi-million shillings expansion programme at the Ahero irrigation scheme has been completed.Irungu said the expansion will benefit 2,500 farmers. The expansion will put an additional 2,500 acres of land under irrigation.At Kobong’o, a Sh150 million irrigation project will ocver 1,000 acres. More than 500 farmers are expected to benefit through growing of high value horticultural crops.The additional 1,000 acres will be cultivated starting February. “The expansion initiated by the NIA is part of a bigger plan to attain the food security agenda, by scaling up irrigation across the country,” Irungu said.The scheme was operationalised in 1969 and has grown over the years to an area of about 13,000 acres benefiting close to 7,000 farmers.Other areas under the Western Kenya Irrigation schemes (WKIS) include West and South-West Kano schemes whose acreage total to about 7,000 acres benefiting more than 5,000 farmers.The two areas have been immensely affected by floods as a result of the back flow of water from Lake Victoria.Ahero Irrigation Scheme falls under the larger WKIS, operationalised in 1969.In 2019, the NIA embarked on an expansion plan of the Ahero scheme to areas such as Mbega and Kobong’o schemes.In Mbega, farmers have fully taken up rice production to more than 1,200 acres so far, while in Kobong’o, farmers are involved in horticultural products such as green grams.Areas such as Mbega and Kobong’o schemes within the larger Kano plains will be irrigated.“Farmers in the area who have been hard hit by perennial floods are now optimistic that their livelihoods will change for the better. They are happy and have embraced the ongoing expansion,” WKIS manager Joel Tanui said.The scheme over the years has seen an increase in the need for irrigated agriculture hence the government’s commitment of resources to expand crop production in the area.In Kobong’o scheme, farmers have embraced horticultural farming with farmers moving away from the norm of rice farming and diversified into horticulture and sugarcane farming.“I am optimistic of good yields by end of the season from my four acres of land,” a farmer Philemon Amai said.The irrigation is done by water pumping from the nearby River Nyando. With the expansion, the expected rice produce stands at 11,000 metric tonnes, estimated to be worth more than Sh500 million.Irungu said Sh25 billion Koru-Soin dam project which is yet to start address flooding menance in Nyando and Muhoroni upon completion. It will also provide adequate water for irrigation farming.The project’s components include the Rockfill dam of 54 meters height, a storage capacity of 93.7MM cubic, water treatment works of 71.279 meters cubic per day.The other benefits include increased area under irrigation schemes in and around Ahero and West Kano Irrigation schemes from 1,800 hectares to 5,370 and also power generation of approximately 2.5 megawatts.With the dam project, the government will construct Sh 2 billion gravity system from Koru-Soin with targeted area of 22,000 hectors of land to be put under irrigation.The gravity system will help eliminate the costly pumping system and control flood problem. It will benefit more than 100,000 households, estimate cost Sh2 billion.Rice farming is a key contributor to the country’s food basket. WKS is comprised of several schemes (public and community initiated); majorly in the Lake Victoria basin.From 1969, two public schemes have been predominant in the region namely Ahero and West Kano Irrigation Schemes.The initial acreage under irrigation stood at 9,898 acres, but as the need for irrigation increases, NIA has endeavoured to commit resources and expand the area under irrigation in the region by additional 2,500 acres over the past year.The total area now stands at 13,098 acres."
203,"Over 5,000 squatters to be settled on Del Monte land","More than 5,000 residents of Murang’a and Kiambu counties are set to settle on a large chunk of land currently owned by fruit processor Del Monte.The beneficiaries are members of Kandara Residents Association who have been pursuing allocation of part of the land occupied by the multinational whose lease is due for renewal.They are expected to settle on 70 per cent of the land that will be released by the firm while 30 per cent will go to the two counties.In a Gazette Notice dated March 1, 2019, the National Land Commission said 70 per of any excess land ceded by Del Monte should be given to members of the community and 30 per cent to the county governments.The 30 per cent that will go to Kiambu and Murang’a is meant for putting up of public utilities including a hospital, markets, social halls, recreational parks, public schools, a police station and government offices.KRA patron Phillip Kamau who addressed members of the association in Thika on Saturday said the breakthrough in their pursuit came through government intervention.He said the court battles pitting the group against the fruit juice maker will come to an end once they settle on the land.“We are waiting for instructions on how and when we will settle on the land. This, of course, means that the cases in courts regarding the Del Monte land will come to end. We are happy that finally justice is being served to us,” Kamau said.The squatters group has been entangled in countless suits with Del Monte Kenya and Murang’a and Kiambu counties over the land that is currently occupied by the firm. The patron noted that the majority of beneficiaries are people whose families suffered historical injustices during the colonial era when they were dispossessed of their land which the colonialists converted into large-scale sisal farms before resorting to pineapple growing.“A good number of them are squatters from Gachagi, Umoja and Madharau villages in Thika while the rest are from Kandara subcounty in Murang’a. God has heard our prayers and we will finally settle on the land which is rightfully ours,” Kamau said.The beneficiaries will be settled on approximately five acres. Besides the residential and agricultural portions that will be subdivided to members, there will be an industrial park, cottage industries, green houses and land for the construction of a mega city.“There are investors, both local and foreign, as well as financiers who have already shown interest in forming partnerships with the beneficiaries. The land that we are set to get will be put into proper use to support the government’s Big Four agendas. Some 2,000 acres will be put into extensive agricultural use where residents will be able to grow enough food for local consumption and for export,’ he said.Kamau noted that there will be construction of a city that’ll be known as Kandara InterCity on the farm along the Nairobi-Nyeri highway. “This is a dream come true for the members most of whom have toiled and moiled for years working as casuals in Del Monte’s pineapple farms and retired without any benefits and who were flushed out of the farm unlawfully,” Kamau said.Residents who spoke after the meeting said they have finally seen a light at the end of the tunnel and that their pursuit and waiting for release of the land for decades will come to an end.“I was born, raised up and got married at the farm now owned by the company. My parents died and were buried in the farm. That land is where I called home and I have waited for more than 50 years to go back there. I am happy that God has answered our prayers,” said Milkah Machuki, 78.Resident Paul Ngugi expressed his joy, saying that his years of being called a squatter have come to an end and that he will now own a portion of land. “I’m also glad because my children and my great grandchildren will have somewhere to call their own home,” Ngugi said.In the meantime, Kamau said that the lobby group will be demanding compensation and a judicial inquiry for victims of atrocities allegedly committed by the firm and their families after it was established that many locals were subjected to brutal treatment and some were even murdered in cases dating back 50 years ago.He said that the latest incident occurred in December last year when three young men lost their lives in the hands of the company guards in a span of one week..The firm owns approximately 50,000 acres under a leasehold pact which is renewable every 99 years.Edited by Henry Makori"
204,Positivity rate below 5% but Kagwe says situation still fluid,"The country’s positivity rate remained below five per cent on Sunday after 85 more cases were recorded from 2,985 samples.This represents a positivity rate of 2.84 per cent. The rate has been below five per cent for more than 14 days.CS Mutahi Kagwe has however said the situation remains fluid. “Under normal circumstances and according to the World Health Organization standards, when you have tested below five per cent for the period that we have, you would normally consider yourself as on the way of having flattened the curve,” Kagwe said.“However, because of the reopening of schools, we do not want to start declaring ourselves having flattened the curve and then start going backwards.” Sunday's cases brought the total number of those who have tested positive to 99,983. Four more Kenyans succumbed to the virus, raising the fatalities to 1,744.Thirty-three patients recovered from the virus – 25 from the home-based care programme and eight were discharged from various health facilities countrywide.However, 545 patients were admitted to various health facilities, while 1,568 were under home-based care and isolation.Twenty-seven patients are in ICU, 15 of whom are on ventilator support and 11 on supplemental oxygen.In terms of the distribution of cases per county, Nairobi recorded 70 more cases followed by Kiambu, Makueni, Mombasa, Nyeri and Nakuru each with two cases.  Laikipia, Machakos, Narok, Nyandarua and Trans Nzoia recorded one case each."
205,Kipchumba scolds EACC for hunting Kang'ata over city hall deal,"Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has scolded the EACC for probing Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata.Kang'ata's law firm is among 24 others being investigated by the Ethics body over dealings with the Nairobi County government.In a  letter to the Nairobi County Secretary EACC requested case files for matters handled by Kang'ata's law firm along with 25 other firms for the period between 2013 and 2020.It said the basis of the probe was a review of the legal fees paid by the county to the firms for the last seven years.""The commission is undertaking investigations at the Nairobi City County in respect of payments of legal fees to the following firms. To facilitate our investigations, kindly but urgently furnish us with the original documents in respect to the mentioned firms,"" read part of the letter.Among details asked by EACC include all payment vouchers and cheque counterfoil, a list of pre-qualified law firms for the year 2013-2020 and minutes approving the list of the pre-qualified law firms.But Murkomen on his Twitter page said such a move is tactless and uncalculated.He said just because the Senator wrote to president Uhuru over the BBI referendum, EACC was being used to intimidate him.""Tactlessand uncalculated. They have started their intimidation against Kangata by sending EACC to investigate payment done in 2018,"" he said.He added, ""Just because of a letter ?. You mean they couldn’t even hide it? This is petty. We’ve consistently warned against the use of EACC and DCI for political intimidation"".Earlier on Kang'ata dismissed the allegations of irregular payments terming the probe a political maneuver against him.According to the Senator, in 2018 he was paid by the county for the services he rendered.""I got paid and everything ended well. These investigations are nothing but politics. I have been in public service as a councilor, MP, and Senator and these are the first investigations I am facing,"" he said.He added, ""I have all the documents to show my singular payment from City Hall was legal and legitimate. It's not a coincidence that the investigations is being done three years after the payment"".While warning his political prosecutors, Kang'ata said as a lawyer he is ready and willing to shake them off.The Senator has been on the spot after he wrote the head of state a letter regarding BBI's popularity in the Mount Kenya region."
206,Portugal votes for new president at height of pandemic,"Masked, socially distanced and each given their own pen to avoid spreading germs, Portugal headed to the polls on Sunday to vote for the largely ceremonial post of president even as coronavirus cases reach record levels.Opinion polls show that the incumbent, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of the centre-right Social Democratic Party, is likely to win with ease.Voters queued up as polls opened in the Lisbon parish of Santo Antonio, guided by red stickers on the ground marking the two-metre gap.""I'm here among the first to avoid groups and queues,"" Cristina Queda, 58, said as she waited. ""Since the date of the elections wasn't changed, I decided to come early to avoid that situation.""Just under two thirds of Portuguese thought the election should have been postponed because of the pandemic, according to a poll conducted last week by research institute ISC/ISCTE.Pollsters predict record abstention of 60-70% in part because hundreds of thousands of voters are themselves in quarantine.Santo Antonio parish head Vasco Morgado said councils had taken all precautions - in his parish's case, including even ambulances at the door in case of emergency.""This is as safe as is possible at this time,"" Morgado said. ""It's a democratic act which many people have fought for over the years - the proof of which is that now, even in a pandemic, people are getting out to vote.""The country of 10 million people is experiencing a severe post-Christmas pandemic surge, with the world's highest seven-day rolling average of new cases and deaths per capita.Authorities reported a record daily toll of 274 deaths and more than 15,300 new cases on Saturday, with ambulances queuing for several hours at hospitals full to capacity.""I don't agree that the date wasn't changed,"" Jose Antonio Queda, 72, who also came early with his wife, said. ""If we're in confinement, we should be avoiding the virus as much as possible."""
207,KLM to keep long haul flights as virus testing demands are softened,"Dutch airline KLM will keep operating long haul flights, including for vaccine distribution, after agreeing with the government on softer demands for returning air crews to carry out rapid COVID-19 tests.The Dutch arm of Air France-KLM said earlier in the week it would cancel all its 270 weekly long-haul flights to the Netherlands as a result of new COVID-19 rules, requiring passengers and crew to show evidence of a negative rapid coronavirus test taken just before departure.KLM at the time said this would make it impossible to keep flying to countries with a high risk of coronavirus infections, as it would risk having to leave crew behind.It warned this would also hurt vaccine distribution as cargo flights would also be canceled.But KLM on Saturday evening said it had reached a compromise in which flight crew on high coronavirus risk flights would take a rapid antigen test before departure from the Netherlands and after their return.Crew would also have to follow strict quarantine rules during their stay abroad, the health ministry said.The Netherlands last week decided to ban all passenger flights from Great Britain, South Africa and South America for up to a month, in a bid to limit the spread of new coronavirus mutations.Passengers traveling to Amsterdam from other high-risk countries are still required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 rapid test taken just before departure, in addition to a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of travel."
208,Main suspect in murder of Chief Inspector Odongo arrested,"Police have arrested the main suspect in the murder of Chief Inspector Henry Odongo four years after he went into hidingAlbert Lelei Ntuitai was arrested on Saturday evening by DCI detectives.Director George Kinoti said before his macabre killing, the late Chief Inspector Odongo was the OCS Muthithi Police Station in Kigumo, Murang’a County.""The suspect then a Police driver had on June 26th 2016, walked into the station’s report office, picked a quarrel with his boss & shot him 9 times in cold blood before disappearing, "" Kinoti said.""But he would not hide for long before the long arm of the law finally caught up with him.""Kinoti said detectives from the Crime Research & Intelligence Bureau have been on his trail .""He was smoked out of his hideout in Senetoi, Narok South. Previous attempts to arrest him had proved futile after he escaped our dragnet for a number of times,"" Kinoti said.Ntuitai is currently being processed to answer to his heinous crime."
209,Raila's messaging dilemma in attack on Uhuru's pledges,"Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga is facing a massive dilemma to sustain his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta and maintain his support bases without jeopardising the Jubilee administration’s agenda.The ODM leader is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Attacking his nemesis,  Deputy President William Ruto, who is the country’s second in command, without appearing to hit out at the President.Raila’s allies are mounting pressure on him to reassert his influence as the ‘poor people’s defender’, amid concerns he may have lost a chunk of his constituency to the DP with his hustler nation and wheelbarrow movement.He began the fresh onslaught with a swipe at the Teachers Service Commission for killing giant teachers union, Knut.The ODM chief later hit out at county governments and the ministry of health over the nurses, clinical officers and lab technicians' strikes.Raila has sustained the salvo against the Jubilee administration during his political meetings, swipes specifically targeting Ruto.With barely 17 months to the next election, pundits argue at the ODM leader could be running out of time in his desire to appease his traditional support bases.He has castigated the government over broken promises of laptops or tablets for Class 1 pupils, construction of stadiums and jobs for youth.His allies have taken this criticism in stride, saying their handshake was meant to give President Kenyatta’s administration a conducive environment for business.Siaya Senator James Orengo – a Raila close ally - also took a swipe at Uhuru, citing uncontrolled borrowing, violation of the law and disrespecting court orders.Prof Macharia Munene, a political analyst, concluded that Raila’s attacks are a survival tactic to counter Ruto’s support wave ahead of 2022.He argued that the ODM leader is trying to recover, “having been known as the fighter and that position is being taken away by Ruto.“He has to regain the image of fighting for the underdog. It is a dicey situation for him. He is trying to respond to Ruto because the DP has stolen his thunder. It is about political survival,” the USIU don said.He told the Star that Raila is desperate, largely because the ‘Stop Ruto’ machinations haven't worked well.Munene observed that these developments are not healthy for the handshake, especially now that the President is saying he is in charge.“This means all the problems are his. When Raila goes around saying things are terrible, then who is he saying is terrible?”The USIU don said Raila has a way of reengineering himself, hence, people should not be surprised when he emerges stronger, saying it was the same with Ruto.Political analyst Prof Edward Kisiangani agreed with Prof Munene that Raila is getting desperate.“He is trying to talk like that so as to recover the ground that is now taken over by Ruto,” the analyst said.“He wants to speak for the people, but they have moved on and think he is not genuine and is now working with somebody else.”Kisiangani said the sentiments by the ODM leader are “political naivety”.""Sometimes you’d think he is losing some memory. He doesn’t remember that government policy is articulated by Uhuru and all the people who work under the President articulate the same policy on behalf of Uhuru,” he said.Kisiangani argued that when Ruto was campaigning in 2013 and 2017, the DP was not articulating his policies but “a collective government policy"".“The head of that government who provided the basis for that policy is Uhuru, who is the CEO. Even if Ruto did want the stadiums built and Uhuru supported the call, they’d be built.”His take is that Ruto should be excused from the problems Jubilee encountered in the second term, citing among them the Covid-19 pandemic.“Raila has been defending the government and has been acting as the chief spokesman. How can he turn round? I doubt his gimmicks will work. The ground he used to control has gone. It is difficult for anybody to believe him,” Kisiangani added.But Dr Charles Nyambuga, a communication expert from Maseno University, said that much as time is tight for Raila, he has room if he messages properly.“The truth of the matter is that he is not in government. He is in opposition. Being in the opposition doesn’t mean being at war with the government.”Dr Nyambuga holds that President Kenyatta and Ruto are the ones in government, “irrespective of the circumstances that they find themselves in"".“The final responsibility is not with the handshake but with those who are constitutionally bestowed with the power of ruling,” the don said.He added that if Raila embarks on an aggressive campaign to counter Ruto, he has a chance of regaining his constituency.“Ruto is very adept at propaganda. Raila needs to make Kenyans understand and know the truth. If he does an aggressive campaign, then he has a chance. He is late but he can catch up,” Nyambuga observed.Ruto and his allies maintain that the Jubilee agenda, which Raila is criticising, was derailed by the handshake.In a fightback, ODM has dismissed the notion that the opposition leader is the cause of Jubilee woes and the birth of the hustler movement’.Party chairman John Mbadi said, “I don’t think there is anything inconsistent with what we are doing. When we went to the handshake, did we join the government? No.”He said that the opposition only provided the ground for the government to function, adding that it should thus not be construed that they were part of it.The Suba South MP said they have qualms with Ruto whom they feel “wants to run away from the mess he created in the Jubilee administration"".ODM is blaming Ruto for having a hand in the country’s bulging public debt – saying the country’s debt almost tripled between 2013 and 2017.“Ruto was so much in the peak and caused the problem that we are in. Not a lot has been borrowed from 2018 to date despite the dire economic situation.”“What we are grappling with is the debt that was taken between 2013 and 2017 and applied in unproductive infrastructure, expenditures like NYS, dams that don’t exist, and is now putting a lot of strain on our economy,” the Suba South MP added.He further cited the Standard Gauge Railway – built at inflated costs - and the Last Mile Connectivity that he argued consumed a lot of resources.“They were connecting electricity to people in grass-thatched houses yet the same households have no food, projects which were executed at the expense of the ability of the economy to pay,” Mbadi said.The ODM chairman said Jubilee – and by extension Ruto - should not lose focus.“It is not that we are running away from the handshake. There is no other alternative to the handshake in this country, we can’t run away from it,” Mbadi said."
210,US broadcaster Larry King dies aged 87,"Larry King, the giant of US broadcasting who achieved worldwide fame for interviewing political leaders and celebrities, has died at the age of 87.King conducted an estimated 50,000 interviews in his six-decade career, which included 25 years as host of the popular CNN talk show Larry King Live.He died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to Ora Media, a production company he co-founded.Earlier this month, he was treated in hospital for Covid-19, US media say.The talk show host had faced several health problems in recent years, including heart attacks.""For 63 years and across the platforms of radio, television and digital media, Larry's many thousands of interviews, awards, and global acclaim stand as a testament to his unique and lasting talent as a broadcaster,"" Ora Media said in a statement.King rose to fame in the 1970s with his radio programme The Larry King Show, on the commercial network Mutual Broadcasting System.He was then the host of Larry King Live on CNN, between 1985 and 2010, carrying out interviews with a host of guests.He also wrote a column for the USA Today newspaper for over 20 years.Most recently, King hosted another programme, Larry King Now, broadcast on Hulu and RT, Russia's state-controlled international broadcaster."
211,Why ministry wants to test antibodies ahead of vaccination,"The Ministry of Health has said it will conduct antibodies test to ascertain how many Kenyans have been infected with Covid-19.The last such test in June 2020 showed about two million Kenyans had antibodies to the virus.Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the exercise will be conducted by the Kenya Medical Research Institute.This will help the ministry decide how to apportion the Covid-19 vaccine because people with antibodies have some natural immunity against the virus and might not need a vaccine urgently. “Moving forward we intend to keep a high level of surveillance and also want to embark on serosurveillance to find out how many would probably have had Covid and not known about it and therefore we can tell what levels of herd immunity we have developed,” Kagwe said.""The whole idea of vaccination is to develop herd immunity and we would like to know where we are even as we are string with the vaccines.”Last week, scientists projected that Covid-19 cases and deaths will likely peak in mid-March, with large numbers to come from schools.Experts from the Kemri estimate there will be between 10,600 and 16,800 new Covid-19 cases and 116 more deaths by June 1.  They say the reopening of schools may cause a rise of the transmission rate by 25 per cent.“We predict that by mid-February the impact of schools opening should be clear in terms of case numbers,” the experts said.The scientists say more than 1.1 million infections could occur over the same period, with the large majority of infections going undetected.“A worst-case scenario would be an increase in transmission rate by 50 per cent and resulting in an epidemic of similar magnitude to the second outbreak in the country. We think this is unlikely,” Kemri said in a statement Thursday.This report comes barely two weeks after Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the government will not declare the curve flattened despite a consistent infection rate below five per cent.“Under normal circumstances and given the positivity rate we have been experiencing over the last one or two weeks, we would be thinking about the declaration of a flattened curve,” Kagwe said.However, he said, the government had yet to consider the impact of the holiday season and reopening of schools.Consequently, the containment measures such as the curfew would remain, he said.Kemri said the 25 per cent increase in transmission rate will depend on whether other restrictions are still in place and level of precaution taken in schools."
212,More countries approve once-a-month ARV,"Two regions have now approved a monthly injectable ARV, a move that could transform HIV treatment.On Friday, the United States approved the Cabenuva (cabotegravir and rilpivirine) which is administered once a month, joining the Europe Union, which approved the same last month.The approvals are supported by findings from clinical trials showing 94 per cent of participants injected with the regimens achieved fully suppressed viral loads for at least six months.The injectables are administered by a health care provider as two separate shots in the buttocks once a month.“Cabenuva reduces the treatment dosing days from 365 days to 12 days per year,” said a statement from Lynn Baxter, head of North America at ViiV Healthcare - the company behind the Cabenuva combination - immediately after the US approval.The monthly injectable regime was first approved in Canada in March 2020, then by the European Union in December last year.Benefitting patients will do away with the daily ARV pills.However, Viiv set a strict criteria on who can be put on the monthly injectable.The patients must already be virologically suppressed, with no history of treatment failure, and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine.“Prior to initiating treatment of Cabenuva, oral dosing of cabotegravir and rilpivirine should be administered for approximately one month to assess the tolerability of each therapy,” Viiv said in a statement.Monthly ARVs are a victory to patients, who say the daily pills act as a constant reminder of HIV and can lead to their HIV status being disclosed.In the US, the new injectable will cost Sh400,000 ($3,960) a month, or more than (Sh4.8 million) $47,500 a year.Viiv says the price is “within the range” of HIV treatment pills in the US, where HIV medicines are already scandalously expensive.In Kenya, a full dose of ARVs for one year costs about Sh20,000 ($200).However, this is because the drugs sold here are generics, whose cost has been subsidised further through price deals between governments and HIV drug companies.Unless such deals are negotiated for the long-acting injectables, they are likely to take years before reaching developing countries, where they will still be too expensive.Long-acting injectables have been proven to work before.In 2019, US-based Kenyan scientist Prof Benson Edagwa created a new, once-a-year formulation of cabotegravir.In November last year, a study done partly in Kenya showed that cabotegravir, administered by injection every two months, is 89 per cent more efficient in preventing HIV in women compared to daily tablets of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).Edited by Henry Makori"
213,"Hot weather to resume on Monday, says Met","The rains expected this weekend will end on Monday in most places, the Met Department says.Although many places only experienced dark clouds on Friday, Met said the prediction still stands and rains would still come.The wet weather is expected in parts of the Lake Victoria Basin, the highlands west of the Rift Valley, the central and south Rift Valley, and the highlands east of the Rift Valley (including Nairobi county).The southeastern lowlands ((Kitui, Makueni, Machakos, Kajiado and Taita Taveta counties) and the Northeast ((Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa and Isiolo counties) were also expected to receive heavy rainfall Friday and Saturday.The five-day forecast ending on January 27 shows most of the country will revert to dry weather on Monday.The rains are welcome to farmers who have not harvested their crops planted late last year.The October-December short rains were depressed and most meteorological stations recorded below 75 per cent of the December long term averages. This is because Kenya is going through a La Nina.Last week, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, supported by USAID, warned of a decline in food security across Kenya.Most affected will be people in eastern and northern Kenya, who will need relief food and livestock off-take by May.The outlook said pastoral areas will be most affected because the short rains were below average and there are three dry months ahead.The early warning platform advises farmers to sell some of their livestock through off-take programmes.“The forecast below-average 2021 long rains are expected to lead to short-lived pasture and water regeneration, and gradual declines in livestock body conditions and production, limiting household access to food and income,” the FewsNet prediction said.It said urban families will also suffer food shortages due to low incomes and higher-priced commodities impacting household purchasing power.Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey recently advised pastoralists in Northeastern to start selling their livestock to avoid losing them during the looming dry season.According to the Nairobi-based Igad Climate Prediction and Application Centre, there will be hot weather in most parts of the country between now and March.Edited by Henry Makori"
214,Magoha dismisses Kemri projections on schools influence on Covid spread,"Education CS George Magoha has dismissed projections by the Kenya Medical Research Institute that the reopening of schools will escalate Covid-19 infections.Kemri on Thursday announced that the reopening of schools could lead to a spike in infections by 13,700. Schools were reopened fully for in-person learning on January 4 after 10 months closure.Speaking in Mombasa, Magoha said schools have not been able to provide social distancing for learners which is vital in preventing the spread of the virus. He however insisted that learners are masked and will be just fine.On Wednesday, Magoha praised efforts by schools to stem the spread of Covid-19, leading to a decline in infections three weeks after reopening.“I want to thank all stakeholders that we are now going into the third week of reopening and there is no surge of Covid-19, instead it is actually going down,” Magoha said at Our Lady of Fatima Secondary School in Nairobi.On Friday, the CS said the infection rate stood at only 2.3 per cent.“Do you want me to listen to your politics or look at the facts? We have not provided social distancing to a large number of learning institutions but the learners are masked,” he said.Researchers feared that school reopening might spread the virus through communities. But stakeholder such as Unicef say there is little evidence that it’s happening.Random testing of learners in the United States and Britain show that schools do not seem to be stoking community transmission of the coronavirus.The rates from the study are even lesser among young learners in kindergarten.However, the situation of Britain and the US cannot be conclusive in the Kenyan case with disparity lying in the school infrastructure, and population."
215,Britain to discuss tighter travel restrictions,"British ministers are to discuss on Monday further tightening travel restrictions, the BBC reported on Saturday, adding that people arriving in the country could be required to quarantine in hotels.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference on Friday that the UK may need to implement further measures to protect its borders from new variants of COVID-19.Britain's current restrictions ban most international travel while new rules introduced earlier in January require a negative coronavirus test before departure for most people arriving, as well as a period of quarantine.The government is considering making it mandatory for travellers to spend that 10-day quarantine period in a hotel for which they would have to pay, as a way to enforce the quarantine rules, the BBC said.Amid growing worries about new COVID-19 variants, critics of Britain's current quarantine policy say it is not sufficiently enforced.Stricter border rules would be a fresh blow for the aviation and travel sectors, already under great financial strain from close to a year of COVID-19 restrictions and minimal revenues.In England, the 10-day quarantine requirement can be reduced if the traveller has a negative COVID-19 test after five days, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have slightly different rules."
216,Garissa residents seek to stop transfer of chiefs,"Two Garissa residents have moved to court seeking to stop the transfer of chiefs and assistant chiefs as directed by the Interior ministry.Hassan Rage Abdi and Hamdi Mohammed from Lagdera constituency want the court to stop transfers of chiefs pending hearing of their case.“Pending inter-parties hearing, the court be pleased to suspend letters addressed to deputy county commanders Lagdera subcounty by the Garissa county commissioner and any preceding communication whatsoever requiring translocation of chiefs and assistants chiefs from their respective current offices of posts,” the application reads.They further want the court to stop the state from translocating the Kenyan-Somali (Auliyan) community and the chiefs and assistant chiefs living and based in settlements along Isiolo-Mogadishe-Wajir roads.The areas in question include Janju, Barquqe Garse, Bulo sublocation and Eldere, Tokojo, Hadun, Kambi Samaki locations in Garissa.It is alleged that the letter dated May 16, 2019 had stated that the joint regional security and intelligence committee resolved that chiefs who are operating in areas within the East region and answering to the Northeastern region should be relocated with immediate effect to their jurisdiction.“Another letter allegedly directed the deputy county commander to relocate the said chiefs and assistant chiefs from Isiolo county to their respective administrative units in Garissa county with immediate effect,” read court papers.According to court documents, the implications of the translocation of the chiefs from their posts as well as amenities will ultimately have an effect of backdoor alternation of the boundaries between the two counties - Garissa and Isiolo - to the detriment of resident of the settlements.The residents claim there was no public participation on the decision, which shall have the effect of exposing the residents to insecurity and raising tension.They have sued the CS Interior Fred Matiang'i and among those listed as interested parties are IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and the NCIC chairperson.In his affidavit, Abdi says Matiang'i has arbitrarily, capriciously and whimsically ordered for the removal of all government personnel provision services to the residents of the locations.Edited by Henry Makori"
217,Corona vaccine to reach Kenya from third week of February,"The earliest Kenya can receive the Covid-19 vaccine is from the third week of February, according to projections given by Gavi.The vaccine alliance said the World Health Organization must first grant the AstraZeneca vaccine emergency use listing, after reviewing its quality, safety, efficacy and performance data.The process is already underway and is critical in ensuring that any vaccine procured through Covax is fully quality assured.“A decision on this candidate is anticipated by WHO in the second half of February at the earliest,” Gavi said.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is the only one to have received the emergency validation from WHO since the outbreak began a year ago.Gavi said it has signed an agreement with Pfizer to receive its vaccine also, but this vaccine is unlikely to be supplied to poor countries.Kenya has ordered 24 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for 20 per cent of the country’s population.However, Gavi said it will initially supply just a few doses to cover frontline workers and people with pre-existing health conditions.Gavi said it will next week indicate approximately how many doses each country will receive initially, to help them plan.“This indicative allocation will provide interim guidance to participants – offering a minimum planning scenario to enable preparations for the final allocation of the number of doses each participant will receive,” it said in a statement.Gavi further announced the signing of an advance purchase agreement with Pfizer for up to 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate.“We expect to be able to begin deliveries of life-saving Covid-19 vaccines February. This is not just significant for Covax, it is a major step forward for equitable access to vaccines, and an essential part of the global effort to beat this pandemic,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, which leads Covax procurement and delivery.WHO boss Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the vaccines will stabilise health systems and drive the global economic recovery.“The urgent and equitable rollout of vaccines is not just a moral imperative, it’s also a strategic and economic imperative,” he said.“These purchase agreements open the door for these lifesaving vaccines to become available to people in the most vulnerable countries,” said Unicef Executive Director Henrietta Fore.“But at the same time we are securing vaccines we must also ensure that countries are ready to receive them, deploy them, and build trust in them.”Edited by Henry Makori"

219,Prepare for fierce battle in Machakos by-election – Kalonzo,"Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has exuded confidence that his party will win in the forthcoming Machakos senatorial by-election scheduled for March 18.Kalonzo said their opponents should prepare for a bruising political battle since they will not take any chance in ensuring that Wiper candidate Agnes Kavindu becomes the next Machakos senator.He told off some political leaders from Machakos county who had reportedly said that non-Machakos politicians were not allowed to visit the county to drum up support for their candidates.“I want to tell off those leaders who said the electorate shouldn’t entertain people from outside Machakos county that there is the freedom of movement. People will come from all over the country to campaign for our candidate Agnes Kavindu,” Kalonzo said.He addressed the press shortly after he chaired a five-hour closed-door Wiper legislators meeting at Stoni Athi Resort in Mavoko, Machakos county, on Friday.The leaders included Wiper MPs and MCAs from the larger Ukambani region alongside Transport CAS Wavinya Ndeti and the party’s senatorial candidate in the by-election Agnes Kavindu.“It’s unfortunate for them because this is the only senatorial by-election so people will have interests. Leaders will come, especially those from the entire Ukambani region,” Kalonzo said.He added, “We have a very strong candidate for the senatorial by-election. Nominations will be conducted by IEBC this coming Monday and Tuesday. We continue wishing her well and I feel we have a winner here. If she was in Jubilee she could gunner 95,000 votes, you can imagine with Wiper ticket she is up there.”Kalonzo said they were, however, not taking any chance as a party. He said they never settled on the ex-Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama’s former wife because the party had no alternative but because she is a leader.“This party upholds very high family values and the issues here have nothing to do with Agnes’s family. It is that this is a leader whom we are commending to the people of Machakos county. So, we are very happy.”Kalonzo said they will comply with the IEBC code of conduct including the government’s Covid-19 directives throughout their campaigns and by-election.The Wiper leader criticised leaders who, he said, were fond of making reckless statements thereby polarising the country through incitement on tribal lines and the hustlers verses dynasties narrative.“Leaders should be responsible, none of them is above the law. There would be no country without the rule of law,” Kalonzo said.Wiper secretary general Robert Mbui said they were determined to deliver the seat to the party.The Kathiani MP said Wiper had signed a cooperation agreement with the Jubilee Party on the Machakos senatorial by-election.“So, Jubilee Party isn’t fielding a candidate and that candidate who was in Jubilee in 2017 has now officially joined Wiper under the arrangement of cooperation. Agnes Kavindu who was in Jubilee is now in Wiper and vying for this seat. It’s also an arrangement of coalition between these two parties,” Mbui said.Edited by Henry Makori"
220,MP Nzengu urges teen mums to go back to class,"Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu has urged teenage mothers to go back to school.Speaking in Usueni, Tseikuru, Nzengu urged parents with children who may have given birth to take them back to school.“Even those who are pregnant should resume school once they deliver to ensure they do not cut short their education,” Nzengu said.Schools closure for over nine months in the country following the Covid-19 outbreak led to increased cases of teenage pregnancies.Nzengu urged teachers to protect the young mothers from any form of criticism so they can have a peaceful learning environment.The MP spoke when he issued Sh43 million bursaries to needy learners.The ongoing bursary issuance drive is set to benefit over 10,000 learners across all the 33 locations of Mwingi North."
221,Happy birthday! Kenyans wish Charles Njonjo as he turns 101,"Kenya‘s first Attorney General, the duke of Kabeteshire Charles Njonjo has today turned 101. Njonjo who was born in January 23, 1920 is the only surviving member of Kenya’s first Cabinet in 1963.Kenyans have sent their birthday wishes to the man who was instrumental in elevating Daniel Moi to vice president after Josphat Murumbi resigned in 1967.Njonjo is a formidable, powerful figure in Kenyan history and especially the Independence era when he wielded enormous influence.He is famous for his eloquence, English mannerisms and fondness for English culture, so fond that he earned the informal, and not entirely complimentary title 'Sir' Charles.The former AG is famous for his striped suits that he states he buys only in London, worn with his signature red rosebud in his lapel.Njonjo had the ear of founding President Jomo Kenyatta and rode in his limousine.This was ostensibly because he wanted to ensure the government provided quality services to its citizens, which he said Mzee wanted.A son of Senior Chief Josiah Njonjo in 1920 in a family of eight, Njonjo’s life was and still is characterised by affluence and power."
222,"Man arrested for slitting throat, burning friend to death over Sh4,000","A man has been arrested for slitting the throat of another man and burning his body at a bush in Kitui's Zombe area. Nicholas Luka, 29, was arrested after committing the crime on January 13.DCI Director George Kinoti said the suspect and the 36-yr-old deceased Simon Mwangangi had had an argument over Sh 4,000 debt.

223,"A year after Wuhan lockdown, China reports small rise in virus cases","China on Saturday reported a slight increase in new cases of COVID-19 as it marks the anniversary of the world's first coronavirus lockdown, in the city of Wuhan where the disease emerged in late 2019.The National Health Commission said 107 new COVID-19 cases had been identified on Saturday, up from 103 cases the day before.The commission said in a statement that 90 of the new cases were local infections.The northeastern province of Heilongjiang recorded 56 new cases and neighbouring Jilin province had 13. Both Beijing and Shanghai recorded three new cases each, and the province of Hebei, which surrounds Beijing, recorded 15 new cases.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, fell to 99 from 119 cases a day earlier.Beijing launched mass COVID-19 testing in some areas on Friday and Shanghai was testing all hospital staff as China faced its worst novel coronavirus outbreak since March, with families fretting over Lunar New Year reunion plans.Also on Friday, China reported its first cluster of cases among workers in a meat processing plant in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang, raising consumer concerns.The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China stands at 88,911, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,635.Wuhan shut down transport networks and suspended outgoing flights on Jan. 23, 2020, in an attempt to cut off transmission of the virus.China on Friday premiered a documentary film to mark the anniversary of the lockdown, part of a broader effort to cast China's early response to COVID-19 in a positive light after some suggestions, which authorities reject, of an initial delay.More than 2 million people around the world have died from the novel coronavirus, according to a Reuters tally."
224,How Uhuru will influence 2022 presidential poll,"President Uhuru Kenyatta who retires as the country's youngest Head of State is likely to be at the centre of his succession with influence to determine his heir.Kenya's second President the late Daniel Moi openly campaigned for Uhuru-his then anointed successor in 2002-while Mwai Kibaki in 2013 became tactical and avoided a public declaration.There are indications that Uhuru who turns 61 next year will play an active role in trying to shape his succession with the country's bigwigs already battling for his blessings.The ODM boss Raila Odinga, Deputy President William Ruto, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka have lined up for the President's attention ahead of the 2022 polls.However, with all of them positioning themselves for a presidential run next year, politicians and analysts opine that Uhuru would play his cards carefully to avert jeopardising his succession plan.“He(Uhuru) will definitely try to intervene, and he will, to influence his succession,” said former Githunguri MP Njoroge Baiya.The former chairman of the National Assembly's Constitutional Implementation Oversight Committee said Uhuru will play a visible and active role in shaping the 2022 presidential polls.“You can't say he is going to be a figurehead but if you see the kind of alignments going on in the country, you can't deny his hand,” stated Baiya.The President has already indicated that he would prefer someone outside the Kikuyu or Kalenjin community to become the next president, technically boxing Ruto out of his succession plan.This is seen as part of his scheme to personally influence the succession politics after his remarks triggered excitement in the opposition camps.This means that the President could move to rally his Mt. Kenya backyard behind a Presidential candidate other than Ruto, his second in command.Already there are indications that the President is determined to have the Nasa principals of Raila, Kalonzo and Musalia stick together.Unity among the opposition bigwigs would offer Uhuru political cover to in further annihilate his deputy and foil his presidential ambitions.Political analyst Javas Bigambo told the Star that the President will most likely come out forcefully to drive his succession battle.“I think from the manner in which Uhuru has conducted his affairs it is easy to predict he is likely to express his preference on his preferred candidate,” he said.Bigambo, however, cautioned that whoever will be endorsed by Uhuru must be ready to carry the baggage of the Jubilee failures and the burden that comes with endorsement by the incumbent.""However some benefits like the state machinery will be there for whoever will be endorsed,"" he said.Former Kasarani MP John Njoroge told the Star that the President has clearly made up his mind that he would want to be part of the succession process.“It is crystal clear that Uhuru has already started to influence the succession by stating that it will be a different ball game with a preference for a person outside the Kalenjin or Kikuyu communities,” Njoroge said.The ex-lawmaker, however, maintained that like the Narc wave that swept Kanu out of power in a historic victory by Mwai Kibaki in 2002, the next general election will rekindle the memories.“Kenya is a democratic country and all that Kenyans would want the President to guarantee them is the freedom to exercise their democratic right to vote for whoever they want,' he said.But Siaya women representative Christine Ombaka said the President is determined to ensure that his successor will continue with his legacy plans.""It is no secret that the President is keen to influence the race to succeed him, he knows what is good for the country, and at the right time he will pronounce himself,' she told the Star. The President is working closely with Raila, a former political foe-turned-ally after the March 8, 2018 handshake which birthed the Building Bridges Initiative to amend the Constitution.Raila's supporters hope that Uhuru will anoint him as his successor and avail the state machinery and government apparatus to campaign for the ODM boss next year.However, there are fears that should Uhuru decide to openly endorse Raila, that would precipitate a massive fall out both in government and Nasa that would hand Ruto an edge.Others say if Uhuru decided to remain aloof in the next Presidential campaign, then that would hurt Raila and vanquish his prospects to win the 2022 contest.Unlike Ruto, Raila largely heeded to the President's calls to freeze early 2022 campaigns and has stood with Uhuru amid blistering attacks from Ruto's Tangatanga wing of Jubilee party.The Building Bridge Initiative is seen as the glue that is holding Uhuru and Raila amid concerns that should the BBI flop, then Raila will desert Uhuru and chart his own path.Raila has in the last few days stepped up his public engagements and has rolled out an elaborate plan to revamp the ODM party and rejuvenate the grassroots in readiness for the 2022 polls.Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu maintained that the President will soon step out and show the country direction.“The President will not leave this country in the hands of dishonest people,” said Wambugu.Wambugu said the President will play an active role in securing the future of the country including offering political direction."
225,Yatta land: The elephant in Kalonzo's political room,"The Yatta NYS land grab claims have for decades become political baggage for Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.The 200-acre parcel has been used to politically cut him down to size every election cycle. Months to the next general election, the allegations have once again resurfaced.Kalonzo's political rivals, led by Deputy President William Ruto, are rubbishing his credentials as 'Mr Clean' in an attempt to derail his campaign on the platform of zero tolerance to graft.The former Vice President has changed his party's slogan to 'Kazi Kazi Bila Wizi' (work, work without theft). The anti-corruption crusade is promising to be a major debate as the 2022 presidential race shapes up, with opposition bigwigs appearing united against Ruto.The Yatta land grab claims also headlined the 2017 presidential campaigns after some Jubilee leaders accused Kalonzo of illegally acquiring public land, claims he denied.At the time, Kalonzo was Raila Odinga's running mate on the NASA ticket. They jointly ran charged campaigns to remove President Uhuru Kenyatta from power. “It is clear that the land is grabbed land, that is crystal clear. The issue that we should not question it because it has been grabbed by a member of the same community is taking us back to archaic politics of the yesteryears,” then TNA nominated MP Johnson Sakaja said.Fast forward; days after Kalonzo hit out at Ruto claiming his ""appetite for land grabbing is unrivalled"", he is now under fire over the controversial land.On Friday, Kalonzo presented himself at the DCI headquarters with papers showing how he acquired the land following the claims that he had grabbed it from the National Youth Service. DP Ruto's followers dismissed the move. ""If he (Kalonzo) is a corruption suspect, why did he choose to go to the DCI and not the EACC, which has the specialised mandate on matters of corruption?” Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, a Ruto ally, asked on Friday.He went on: ""Can a suspect choose his investigator? The reason why he went to see [DCI chief George] Kinoti is simple – dry cleaning. Ignore.”Ruto had accused Kalonzo of doing nothing during his 40 years in government apart from illegally acquiring the Yatta land.""You have been in leadership for 40 years without doing anything and your only record is that you are living on government land, which you have turned to be yours,"" the DP said.But Kalonzo on Friday said his opponents, including Ruto, fear his candidature and have now resorted to tarnishing his name.“My political opponents know that my candidature poses a serious threat to their own ambitions, and are clutching at straws because the tides are about to change,” Kalonzo said after a session with DCI officers.He challenged Ruto to also present himself before investigative agencies and open himself up for a thorough lifestyle audit.“As a public officer entrusted with the responsibility of Kenyans, DP Ruto must open himself up to a lifestyle audit and declare his wealth,” he said.In 2018, Kalonzo threatened to sue the government after the then-NYS director-general placed a 14-day eviction notice to the Wiper leader from the 200 acres on which his home sits.“The department, therefore, does not recognise any claim whatsoever that any individual and/or entity has over the said parcels of land, whether through themselves, their agents, assigns or successors,” the notice read.The notice was quickly seen by Kalonzo's allies as a political scheme by the Jubilee administration to force him to recognise President Uhuru Kenyatta who had controversially won the 2017 presidential duel.""This land has never been the property of the NYS. It was allocated to Ketraco that eventually sold to me. The NYS was also allocated a share,"" Kalonzo said in 2018.""The parcel belonged to the former Machakos municipality and was crown land. It was later allocated by former President Mwai Kibaki on the same presidential decree as that of the NYS.”In 2017, Sakaja provided documents showing the land belonged to the NYS before it was subdivided into six portions, with Kalonzo having been allegedly allocated three of them.Then suspended Lands Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu was forced defended Kalonzo over grabbing claims.“This land they are saying Kalonzo grabbed is in our Ukambani land and not on other people's land,"" Ngilu said in 2015 after a mention of a graft case involving a 134-acre Karen land.On February 11, 2013, barely a month to a general election, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption confirmed in a letter to the NYS that it was probing fraudulent acquisition of public land in the service's Yatta scheme.“To assist us to finalise our investigations, you are required to provide us with certified copies of the said title deeds and any other relevant documentation before February 13, 2013,” EACC's Abdi Mohamed wrote.Documents showed that the NYS had also written to the chief quantity surveyor asking for clear-cut boundaries of NYS land LR number 22294, 22295, 22275 and 17762."
226,All cases filed against Kananu merged,"Ten cases challenging the vetting, appointment, swearing-in and assumption of office of Anne Kananu as governor of Nairobi will now be heard together.High Court judge Anthony Mrima consolidated the cases to save judicial time and accord each party an opportunity to be heard.“In order to foster an orderly conduct of all these related matters and given the limited judicial time, coupled with the need to accord each party an opportunity to be heard, I am of the position that all these matters be consolidated,” he said.Petitioners in the cases include Okiya Omtatah, the Law Society of Kenya, Thirdway Alliance and Anne Kananu.It is in the LSK matter that an order was issued stopping the swearing-in of Kananu as substantive governor. Judge Mrima also directed that the matter be heard by a bench to be constituted by acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu.Kananu has since filed an application seeking to set aside those orders. The application is pending hearing and determination, but the judge has since suspended his order sending the matter to the Acting CJ.The court will issue further directions on February 9.The office of Nairobi Governor became vacant after Mike Sonko was impeached. Nairobi assembly speaker Benson Mutura was appointed acting governor until Kananu stepped in."
227,Kilifi to get rid of locusts in 15 days after getting equipment,"The Kilifi government has received better equipment to help speed up the elimination of desert locusts that invaded the county late last year.The county got a vehicle-mounted sprayer, motorised sprayers, pressure sprayers and hand sprayers to complete the operation in infested areas within 15 days.County officials said the equipment will complement the existing equipment being used by 50 National Youth Service officers who have been on the ground spraying the locusts since January 4.This is after the officials found that the locusts had hatched, with new breeds being very devastating as they feed a lot.County chief officer for Livestock and fisheries Fredrick Kaingu said the new equipment uses modern technology and is able to cover a longer distance of about 50 metres.Speaking in Gongoni during the official handover of the equipment by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the national government, he said the equipment will speed up the war on the locusts.""We have also received modernised hand sprayers that can spray up to 30 metres, and those are in our custody,"" Kaingu said.They had been using the sprayers that could only cover a 10-metre distance. However, with the new equipment, they will be able to eliminate the locusts much faster.The operation has covered about 60 per cent of the total target of 1,200 hectares. Kaingu said since they started the operation, the response on the ground has been positive as farmers are very happy and have welcomed the efforts by the county and national government.Anthony Ngala, the coordinator of desert locusts in the county, said since they started, they have been relying on the NYS, but with the arrival of the more sophisticated weapons, the operation will be faster and effective.Ngala said the density of pests was very high in Ndzovuni area of Gongoni, Magarini, but they were able to control them. They also controlled the pests in Marereni area near the border of Kilifi and Tana River county.So far, the pests are in stage four. He said they will not allow them to reach stage five—the most dangerous stage.""The equipment we have received uses ULV pesticide, that is ultra-low volume pesticide. This pesticide is not mixed with water,"" he said."
228,"After stalling more than four years, water hyacinth harvester handed over to LBDA to start operation","Sh.81 million water hyacinth harvester has been officially handed over to the Lake Basin Development Authority by the government.Also handed over include two Tipas trucks each costing around Sh.10 million.The machine, procured by Lake Victoria Environment Management Project II and funded by the national government and the World Bank, was stalled immediately it was bought.It was bought from Italy in 2016 after it was established that the weed can be mechanically removed from the lake.Technicians cited missing components and mechanical problems for its state of affairs.However on Friday, the PS Environment and Forestry, Chris Kiptoo, handed over the machine and trucks to the authority, stating that the issues of procurement concerning the machine have finally been sorted out.""The problem with the machine required  wider consultation because there were contractual issues between the ministry and supplier and we have been able to bring on board the Attorney General, Ministry of Finance to go through this process,"" he said.Kiptoo noted that as a ministry of environment, they feel that the issue of managing water hyacinth can best be done by LBDA because it covers more counties.""As a ministry of environment under LVEMP program we identified Lake Victoria as an important resource and the utilization of the natural resources there have been hampered by the invasive weed, identified in the country in the 90s,"" Kiptoo said.He noted that they have undertaken two approaches with the preventive approach where they try to work on pollution control by ensuring that they manage within the catchment areas that their is less pollution in the Lake.'This has greatly improved because this year we visited the region and took action against persons and companies pollution the lake. I can say that the recreation of hyacinth in the Lake is not high as before,"" he added.The second curative measure he mentioned was the use biological control as a long term measure to control the weed by will also have the issue of mechanical harvesting which will be done by the machines.The State PS State Department of Regional and Northern Corridor Development Margaret Mwakima noted that the water hyacinth has had a devastating effect on Lake Victoria and was happy that the machine will mechanically remove the hyacinth, especially at the Kavirondo Gulf.Mwakima noted that its now the responsibility of LBDA to ensure that the water hyacinth becomes a history.""This must take a very integrated approach. We must control the flow of organic waste to manage nutrification, because the weed thrives best on nutrification. We also have to incorporate biological control especially at the floating islands and be able to concentrate at the Kavirondo Gulf,"" Mwakima said.She added that they will work closely with NEMA and there are guidelines towards disposal of water hyacinth. In 2019, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission was investigating the procurement of the water hyacinth harvester.The anti-graft agency also sought the minutes of the meetings approving the purchase of the harvester and a copy of the World Bank tender regulation, Act or policy used during the tendering.Other documents sought include tender opening registers, letter appointing members of opening and ministerial tender committees and letters of appointments forwarding the reports to the World Bank for no objection.In 2018, a parliamentary select committee said it would summon the Environment CS to explain why the hyacinth harvester stalled."
229,"Get ready, prepare yourself for the many investments coming to the region - Raila","Be ready and prepare yourself for various investment opportunities set to be witnessed within the Lake region, ODM Leader Raila Odinga has told residents.Raila noted that the region is lined up for a myriad development opportunist as a result of the revamping of the  Railways line, rehabilitation of Kisumu port and the established of the Special Economic Zone in Miwani that will see factories being constructed in the area.Raila said they want to transform the lives of people living within the region and this will be through industrialization, value additions of raw materials being manufactured within the region.“We don't want to be exporting raw materials but exporting finished products,” he said.He said Kisumu is strategically situated because it has  regional market and opportunities for investments are going to be many.However on the Standard Gauge Railway, Raila noted that this will also come to Kisumu.""Meter Gauge being rehabilitated but does not mean SGR is not coming. Its just a matter of time,"" he said.He was speaking at the Kisumu Hindu crematorium where Sardar Channel Singh Chatthe, the founder of Chatthe Group of Companies was being cremated.Raila lauded the Chatthe family and the Asian community in the role they have played within the county in building domestic economy by putting up various multibilion industries in Kisumu.He called on Kenyans to embrace cultural diversity because with it comes a myriad of benefits when people of different races come together to do business, stay or work together.Raila stated that nobody is more Kenyan than the other and called for tolerance, equal treatment of all Kenyans.""Nobody should ever discriminate against  you that you are Kenyan and every one of us is a first class Kenyan citizen and we have a right and responsibility to build this country together,"" he told them.""We don't have Indians in Kenya, but we have Kenyans of Indian origin just like Raila is Kenyan of Sundanese Origin, just like Kambas's to Tanzania, Kikuyu's amongst others from different origin hence we are all immigrants of this place called Kenya."""
230,Mwilu warns judicial officers against delaying justice,"Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has warned magistrates and judges that they will be sacked for delaying justice.In her second public engagement in Narok after retired Chief Justice David Maraga handed over to her, Mwilu said judicial officers should serve the public effectively and facilitate justice without being influenced.“When you are misguided to do wrong things you have no otherwise but to face the Judicial Service Commission and your job might end there,” Mwilu said.She made the remarks after opening the High Court and the Environment and Land Court sub-registries at Kilgoris law courts on Thursday.Mwilu said she had received complaints about corrupt judicial officers.“Remember taxpayers' money is used to pay your salaries and you should work in accordance with the law,” she said.The CJ told judicial staff unhappy with their jobs to resign instead of ruining the image of the entire institution.“If you are in the Judiciary and incapable of doing your job, please do us a favour and move out,"" Mwilu said.She reminded judges and magistrates to use alternative dispute mechanisms to resolve some cases.Mwilu also decried child marriages and early pregnancies in Narok and called upon county government to do everything possible to end the vices.“Impregnating young girls is ruining our society. We should let girls be girls and not mothers at an early age,” she said.She said the penalties for the vices are stiff and if anyone is caught they will spend their lives in jail.Narok Governor Samuel Tunai called for the posting of more judicial officers in the region to handle early pregnancy and child marriage cases which are rampant in the county.He urged the MPs to review laws on the vices, saying that hefty punishments should be meted on the culprits.The county boss called on Parliament to allocate the Judiciary more money so that they can undertake their work effectively and ensure Kenyans get justice in time."
231,"You are part of Jubilee failures, Ruto tells Raila","Deputy President William Ruto now says Raila Odinga's ODM party cannot run away from the failures it has caused the government.Ruto on Friday said the Opposition party has been part of the running of Jubilee government for the past three years using the Handshake.Speaking at his Karen home on Friday, Ruto said ODM is to blame for causing the government to deviate from its Big Four Agenda plan.“You came and changed the Government’s priorities from the Big Four Agenda to alternative ones like the Building Bridges Initiative. Now, after you have failed miserably, you want to run away,” he said.Ruto said Raila and his ODM brigade will be held to account for the monumental failures it has caused the country.“You must bear the consequences for the derailment of Jubilee’s development agenda. You cannot point fingers at others,”  he said.He spoke after he held talks with the Members of County Assembly from Mandera County led by Majority Leader Abdi Adan Ali.The DP asked politicians not to criminalise discussions about the needs and aspirations of ordinary Kenyans.He said it was time the national conversation centred around the empowerment of the people at the bottom of the wealth pyramid.While defending his 'hustler nation' narrative, Ruto said the hustler conversation was not meant to divide Kenyans but to highlight and address the plight of poor Kenyans.“The discussion we are having about hustler nation is not a discussion about the rich and the poor,  it is about getting everybody to the table and ensure everybody counts,"" he said.“How is it a discussion that is dividing people if we are saying let us also have a discussion about the ordinary people of Kenya?” he posed.He said for far too long the national conversation had been about leaders and positions of power at the expense of the needs of the ordinary people.His sentiments come hours after former Vice President and Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka said Ruto should be barred from using the hustler nation tag.Kalonzo said the DP is hiding behind the tag to cause divisions while spreading falsehood and propaganda."

I am here to present new and good ideas as we protect devolution,"" he said.Godhana said the chairmanship role was rotational and it would only be fair if it was taken to Coast.""This seat has not been given to Coastarians. it's only fair that other regions are given an opportunity. This time there is someone who has volunteered. So people from the Coast need this chance,"" he said.""I am very eligible, in terms of qualification, I over qualify.""Oparanya was elected by his colleagues in February 2020 for a second and final term in office through consensus after President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila backed his bid.There are reports that Uhuru will throw his weight behind a governor who supports the BBI process to succeed Oparanya. The head of state has enjoyed a good working relationship with Oparanya during the latter's tenure. Their camaraderie blossomed further with their BBI agitation.CoG chairmanship is a powerful post that serves as a link between the county governments and the national executive and has a lot of leverage, including unfettered access to the President.The chairperson serves as the voice of the county governments and has a lot of privileges, including a stand-by chopper funded by taxpayers through the council's secretariat."

235,Uhuru unveils UN model to boost Kenya's manufacturing sector,"President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday unveiled a $30 billion United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) mechanism to help stimulate Kenya’s manufacturing sector.The initiative dubbed, Programme for Country Partnership (PCP) Starter Pack, is a model for accelerating industrial development in UNIDO member states by mobilizing resources for investment in high potential economic sectors.The PCP, which is also successfully being rolled out in Ethiopia, Senegal and Peru, will boost Kenya's manufacturing potential by injecting more than USD 30 billion in the sector in the next five years.In his speech during the virtual launch of the initiative, Uhuru said Kenya opted for the new approach so as to accelerate inclusive and sustainable industrial development in the country.“The potential contribution of the PCP includes an increased share of the manufacturing sector, food security and improved nutrition and increased domestic and foreign investment,” Uhuru said.He said Kenya will leverage on its strong market-based economy and existing institutional structures for industrial development to reap maximum benefits from the UN intervention.At the event also addressed by UNIDO’s Director General Li Yong, the President announced that the National Development Implementation and Communication Cabinet Committee (NDICCC) led by Interior CS Fred Matiang’i will spearhead the uptake of PCP in the country.Uhuru also lobbied partners to support the implementation of PCP's anchor programmes saying the intervention's success will largely depend on the ability of stakeholders to mobilize adequate resources for its rollout.“I, therefore, direct that the Cabinet Secretaries of the Ministries of Interior and Coordination of National Government; the National Treasury and Planning and the Industrialization, Trade and Enterprise Development, provide necessary guidance on finalization of PCP and mobilization of resources for its implementation,” Uhuru said.Uhuru also launched the first PCP anchor project in the country, an Integrated Agro-Industrial Park on a 280-acre parcel of land donated by Nyamira County and urged other County Governments to join the initiative.He said PCP will support both public and private sector institutions in Kenya to enhance their industrial productivity through innovation, technology transfer, financing as well as knowledge and skills upgrading.“To enhance and promote competitiveness and within the PCP model, my Administration will continue to support the establishment of Industrial Parks and Special Economic Zones that will provide a competitive platform for industrial development,"" he said.“Kenya has the potential to develop Agro-processing facilities in 41 out of 47 Counties.

237,Mombasa signs tourism deal with Ukrainian City of Odesa,"Mombasa and Ukrainian City of Odesa have signed a partnership deal to unlock tourism potential.The agreement was signed by Odesa Deputy Mayor Oleg Bryndak and Mombasa Deputy Governor William Kingi on Wednesday. “The agreement was signed with the support of Odesa City Council, Embassy of Ukraine in Kenya, Honorary Consulate of Ukraine in Mombasa and the Mombasa county government.""The agreement between Ukrainian Odesa and Kenyan Mombasa will help to establish and strengthen the ties between the business circles of the two cities, unlock mutual tourism potential and expand cooperation between cities’ ports,” Ukraine Embassy said in a statement.During the visit, Ambassador Andrii Pravednyk, Embassy’s Consul Artem Makarov and the Honorary Consul of Ukraine in Mombasa Oleksii Sierkov held a meeting with the representatives of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Mombasa branch.They discussed the potential areas of cooperation between Ukrainian entrepreneurs and Mombasa. Additionally, Ukrainian diplomats met business representatives in Mombasa to facilitate the development of people-to-people contacts with the county.Like Mombasa, Odessa is a tourism destination, a seaport and transport hub located on the northwestern shore of the Black Sea in Ukraine. It is the fourth largest city in the Eastern Europe country.In May 2018, then-Ukraine Minister for Foreign Affairs Pavlo Klimkin opened the Honorary Consulate in Mombasa, the sea gateway to East Africa and a hub where trade routes from across the world converge.At the time, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho said the consulate would create direct linkage between Ukrainians and Mombasa residents.He further noted that it would enhance partnerships and investment, ""especially in the sustainable exploitation of blue economy manufacturing and tourism sectors"".Since 2016, Ukraine has intensified its political and trade relations with Kenya. In December 2016, the first trade mission from Ukraine visited Kenya to establish direct contacts with the government and the business community.To enhance tourism and people-to-people relations, former Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya in 2019 told the Star Kenya needed to have active advertisements in Ukrainian media, noting: ""Tourism should be repetitive; a friend tells a friend."""
238,Man who allegedly barred NLC from compensating Sh2.6bn land denies fraud charges,"A man who allegedly barred the National Lands Commission from compensating a woman's Sh2.6 billion land has been charged.Simon Nyamanya had on Monday been arraigned before Makadara chief magistrate Angelo Kithinji did not take plea.This was after defence counsel William Arusei filed an application to reject charges against him on grounds that there is a similar matter before the Milimani court.But the court quashed the application on Wednesday and ordered the plea taking to proceed.Nyamanya faces three counts of fraud-related charges.In the first count, the court heard that Nyamanya, with intent to defraud and by means of false and fraudulent representation procured NLC to stop an award of compulsory acquisition of land belonging to Roseline Njeri per a gazette notice dated September 4, 2020. Nyamanya is said to have committed the offence on October 13, 2020 at the NLC Directorate of Valuation and Taxation in Nairobi with others not before court.In the second count, Nyamanya is accused of procuring a court order by false presence barring NLC on behalf of Kenya National Highway Authority from compensating Njeri.He is accused of committing the offence jointly with others not before court on November 24 at the Milimani law court.In the third count, he is accused of conspiring to defraud the process of compulsory acquisition of the parcel by falsely pretending to be the owner.According to the prosecution report, the accused was arrested on January 15 at the Ministry of Lands offices in Machakos and was escorted to Jogoo Road police station.He denied the charges and what followed was a heated debate after the prosecution said they wished to file an application through a sworn affidavit by inspector Peter Kanagi to deny the accused bail or bond terms.In the affidavit filed before chief magistrate Heston Nyagah, Kanagi said the suspect had been charged on the basis of the same documents at the Milimani and Makadara court in an ongoing case.“There is a cry in the public that the accused is a land fraudster who has been causing members of the public great pain and if released, his life would be in danger until the charged crowd calms down,” reads part of the affidavit.Arusei, however, argued that the affidavit is prejudicial, malicious and it’s meant to undermine the accused's rights to a fair trial.He said the case at Milimani has been ongoing since 2016, yet the prosecution has not tabled any evidence to show his client has ever interfered with witnesses in the case.In a quick rejoinder senior prosecution counsel Joseph Burugu said there has been a serious fight by the defence to prevent the accused from taking a plea.And there is still an attempt to block the prosecution from tabling to the court compelling reasons why they wished the accused to remain in custody.“Article 50 of the Constitution favors the accused person. It's not always about the accused, we have a complainant in the case as well. The right to liberty for the accused is not absolute,” he said.A ruling is set to be made today on Friday."
239,Rattled: How Isaac Rutto has changed Bomet governor race,"Former Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto’s return to Deputy President William Ruto’s camp has complicated the political arithmetic in the county and put governor Hillary Barchok in a tight corner.Rutto, a veteran politician with a gift of the garb, was swept away in the 2017 gubernatorial contest by the Jubilee wave and his return to claim his seat has set the stage for a titanic clash.Barchok has largely been a scholar and was plucked from lecture halls by the late Governor Joyce Laboso.But the Governor has moved to quell the rising tension and a possible split in his house following the entrance of Rutto who is the Chama Cha Mashinani party leaderThe Star has established that since Monday, Barchok has been holding in meetings at his office as he tries to strategize on how to tame Rutto.He has been enjoying unrivalled support in most parts of the county being the only hopeful among the Jubilee candidates in the region.On Tuesday, the governor held a daylong meeting with all the elected members from the county assembly.On Monday the governor also held several meetings at his office with opinion leaders from Sotik, Laboso’s home turf.In his meetings, however, Barchkok sidelined MCA’s from CCM party and 10 nominated members who are said to be allied to the former governor.It was not immediately known what the discussion centred on but close sources told the Star that key issues affecting the residents which include development and creation of employment opportunities were discussed.Singorwet ward MCA Alfred Langat confided to us that they also deliberated extensively on the current political developments in the county.They did not arrive on any deal on the approaches to be employed with more meetings said to have been lined up.Barchok is also said to be contemplating meeting the Deputy President soon to discuss what Rutto entry means to him.“We told the governor to remain focused and not to be diverted by the entrance of Rutto to should not start unnecessary political wars with him at the expense of his agenda to the people,” he stated.Barchok feels that with the admission of the outspoken and daring CCM party who seems to command a large following in the county, his chances of easily winning the seat in 2022 will be slim.Political analyst and former Bomet mayor Kipkemoi Barsumei says the CCM party leader was under immense pressure from his supporters who feel he has been left out by the train to join hands with the DP.He said the desire for the Kaleniin community to be under one political umbrella under the leadership of the Deputy President made him join the bandwagon.But, the coming in of Rutto according to Barsumei has heralded a new political discussion in town, something that has caused jittery among the supporters of Barchok and which is taking back him to the drawing board.Rutto’s new move has now jilted the support for the current energy and petroleum principal secretary John Mosonik who is seen as an equalizer to the two having set his eyes on the seat.Mosonik intends to vie for the seat and with his entry, the contest will shape up to be a battle of the three political titans.The oratory skills and the gift of the curb will come in handy for Rutto as he faces Barchok and Mosonik who are seen to be soft-spoken but development-oriented."
240,"Illegal drugs sale: 49 arrested, 70 pharmacies closed in crackdown","The Pharmacy and Poisons Board has closed 71 premises for operating illegal pharmacies and herbal clinics in Nairobi and Kajiado counties.In a statement on Friday, Deputy director Dominic Kariuki said 49 people have been arrested and 171 cartons of illegal assorted medicines seized.""The seized medicines will be analyzed and disposed of as per PPB guidelines on disposal of pharmaceutical waste,"" Kariuki said.The list of closed premises has been shared with county administration and National Police Service for enforcement of closure.During the crackdown, PPB officials obtained invoices, receipts and other documents from the illegal premises.""This is helping us to identify the licensed wholesalers of pharmaceuticals who are supplying these illegal premises. The owners of those wholesalers will be prosecuted and their licenses revoked,"" he said.Those who were taken to courts were given cash bail of between Sh500,000 to Sh150,000.Those who pleaded guilty were fined up to Sh50,000.Kariuki urged the courts to enhance fines for those found guilty, in line with the fines in the amended Cap 244, to act as a deterrent."
241,"Kenya, Algeria ask UN to appoint special envoy deescalate tensions in Western Sahara","Kenya and Algeria have expressed concerns over the escalation of the military tensions in the occupied territories in Western Sahara.In a joint communique between Kenya's Foreign Affairs CS Raychelle Omamo and her Algeria counterpart Sabri Boukadoum, the two countries said the United Nations Secretary-General should appoint his Special Envoy for Western Sahara to advance the consultations and preparations for the UN-mandated Referendum.The concerns come amid escalating armed conflict between Morocco and the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), represented at the United Nations by the Polisario Front, in the disputed region of Western Sahara.This is the latest escalation of an unresolved conflict over the region that has left dozens killed and scores injured.Although the region is largely occupied by Morocco, about 20–25 per cent is administered by the SADR.The violence ended a ceasefire between the opposing sides that had held for 29 years in anticipation of a referendum on self-determination that would have settled the dispute.However, despite the establishment of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara in 1991, the referendum was never held.In mid-October 2020, the tensions deepened when Saharawi peaceful protesters blocked a controversial road connecting Morocco to sub-Saharan Africa.Reports indicate that the protesters camped on the road near the small village of Guerguerat, where it passes through a 5-kilometre-wide buffer strip monitored by the UN.Despite the controversy, the route had grown in economic importance such that the protest stranded about 200 Moroccan truck drivers on the Mauritanian side of the border.As a result, Moroccan forces were deployed near the area in early November with Mauritanian forces reinforcing their positions along its border with Morocco, which is controlled by the Polisario Front.On November 13 last year, Morocco launched a military operation from the Berm into the demilitarised buffer strip of Western Sahara to clear the protesters near Guerguerat and restore the free movement of goods and people.But the Polisario Front urged the United Nations to intervene, noting that the Moroccan military operation violated the ceasefire agreements of the 1990s.The Front furthermore accused the Moroccan security forces of shooting at unarmed civilians in the buffer strip.Morocco, however, denied there had been any armed clashes between the sides and said the truce remained in place while SADR authorities declared the ceasefire over.Clashes spread that same day along the Moroccan Berm, with Morocco claiming that it had repelled a Sahrawi incursion near Al Mahbes.Since the beginning of the conflict, both countries have begun mass mobilisation and the SADR Ministry of Defense claims to be bombarding military objectives along the Moroccan Berm daily.It is the first major clash over the region since 1991.But Kenya and Algeria while reaffirming their position on the achievement of a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution that would provide for the holding a free and fair referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara, underlined the crucial and urgent need for United Nations Secretary-General to appoint his Special Envoy for Western Sahara to advance the consultations and preparations for the UN-mandated Referendum.The two countries Ministers discussed and exchanged views on the political, peace and security situation in Africa, and expressed convergent views and concerns about the instability and conflict in some parts of the Continent, including in Libya, Mali, the Sahel region, the DRC, CAR and in parts of the Horn of Africa Region as well as on the global threat of terrorism and extremism which they condemned in the strongest terms possible.They called for more efforts to stop the increasing and extremely worrying spread of terrorism in all regions of the continent, including through upholding international norms with regards to the prohibition of payment of a ransom to terrorists.Concerning the situation in Libya, the Ministers underscored the need to redouble efforts in order to preserve the cease-fire and secure an inclusive and Libyan-owned political solution to the conflict that will preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Libya and put an end to the external interference in the country.Omamo and Boukadoum underscored the role of neighbouring countries in coordination with the African Union and called for greater involvement of the latter in the ongoing political process to resolve the crisis in Libya.With regards to the situation in Mali, the Ministers underscored the need for the international community to provide the required support in order to ensure the success of the ongoing transition for the benefit of the Malian people.""They acknowledged the role of Algeria in its capacity as Chair of the Follow-up Committee and underscored the importance of the full implementation of the Malian Peace and Reconciliation Agreement, emanating from the Algiers process, to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of the country, as well as the stability of Mali and that of the wider region,"" read part of the communique.They welcomed the progress made in South Sudan by the parties that are signatories to the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS) and welcomed the ongoing peace talks to bring the non-signatories on board.The Ministers encouraged the signatories to conclude the remaining implementation elements of the R-ARCSS and also urged the International Community to extend support and goodwill to the people of South Sudan and parties to the Revitalized Peace Agreement."
242,Telkom's rapid 4G balloon drive in limbo as Loon exits market,"Telkom Kenya’s ambitious plan to reach out to remote areas through internet balloon project is in limbo after Loon LLC announced plans to wound-up business.  In a blog post, Loon chief executive Alastair Westgarth said the business was not commercially viable and that they intend to complete current engagements including a commercial pilot project in Kenya by March 1.In July, at least 10 loon balloons went live in Kenya in a hyped event that was virtually witnessed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in Baringo County. In March, Uhuru announced the approval of universal 4G purposed to lay foundations for data access countrywide as part of the government’s measures to mitigate the disruptions to life by the Covid-19.This was a month after the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) approved the entry of those balloons in Kenya's airspace after two years of contention.The partnership between Telkom Kenya and Google’s parent company Alphabet intended to post 35 balloons in the space, a move that could have seen internet users in 14 counties access the faster 4G network, covering 50,000 square kilometres, 10 per cent of the country.Loon is a network of stratospheric balloons designed to bring internet connectivity to rural and remote communities worldwide.The high-altitude balloons in the stratosphere (altitude: 18km to 25km) create an aerial wireless network with up to 4G-LTE speeds.This was the first commercial launch of loon balloon technology in the world, putting Kenya on the global map in terms of technological advancement.The balloons had previously been used only in emergency situations, such as in Puerto Rico in 2017 after Hurricane Maria wiped out cell towers.On Friday, Telkom Kenya said it regrets that the pilot plan will end prematurely on March 1 but insisted that its long-term terrestrial network expansion plan is still in place. ''It was very exciting, therefore, to partner with like-minded pioneers in the adoption and usage of innovative technologies such as Loon, with the aim of filling in the Internet access gaps in areas that were difficult to service,"" Telkom Kenya’s CEO Mugo Kibati said.More:Loon  said over  the coming months, its team will work closely with Telkom to ensure the operations of the technology’s pilot service are wrapped up safely and smoothly.  ''While we’re sad to share that Loon’s journey is coming to an end, we are grateful to the Telkom team for their vision and partnership, 'Alastair said. Loon has committed $10 million  to support nonprofits and businesses focussed on connectivity, internet, entrepreneurship and education in Kenya as part of compesation plan."
243,Ruto's allies threaten mass walkout from Jubilee as infighting hit crescendo,"Deputy President William Ruto’s allies are plotting a mass walkout from the Jubilee Party amid threats of disciplinary action initiated by the ruling party’s officials from the grassroots.Nakuru County Jubilee Secretary-General Peter Cheruiyot wrote a show-cause letter to Ruto for campaigning for UDA candidates in what is believed to have the blessings of party honchos.But Ruto allies say they are unmoved and openly declared that the wheelbarrow Party is Ruto’s 2022 presidential vehicle.Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei said the DP and his team are only in Jubilee for strategic reasons and waiting for the opportune moment to bolt out “All indications are showing UDA is the vehicle Deputy President will use in 2022 elections,” he stated, days after it emerged the party was setting up a major regional nerve centre in Eldoret, Ruto’s foremost political base.It has also emerged that the party is planning grassroots elections as there is already infighting among aspirants jostling for Ruto's attention.The officials would be elected right from the polling stations, a strategy that was employed by ODM ahead of the 2017 polls Cherargei claimed they are bolting because of the humiliation they have been subjected to in the ruling party.“Some of us have been embarrassed and betrayed in Jubilee. We now have UDA, which will be our political vehicle,” he told the Star.In his letter addressed to the DP, Cheruiyot said Ruto contravened the party constitution after endorsing UDA candidates for Hells Gate and London ward by-elections in the county.The DP has separately sponsored UDA candidates in the Machakos senatorial by-election, Matungu as well as Kabuchai parliamentary polls.Cherargei said they are currently sprucing up UDA for the proper running of a presidential campaign.“It’s no secret. Our vehicle for the presidential race and other political seats will be UDA,” he told the Star.Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa said politicians who subscribe to the Hustler Movement will contest for various seats on UDA ticket.“All hustlers will use UDA as their party of choice to contest for the various seats,” he stated.UDA chairman Johnson Muthama is on record saying Ruto will contest for the presidency on UDA.Soy MP Caleb Kositany has also said they have been humiliated and have no say in Jubilee.“In UDA we have a home. The party will be home to the hustler nation,” he stated.Jubilee has made it clear that Ruto and his allies are staring at punishment for joining and advancing the interests of UDA.UDA has already fielded candidates in the upcoming parliamentary and senatorial by-elections, contradicting the Jubilee position to pull out of the polls.Jubilee will not be fielding candidates in the parliamentary by-election in Kabuchai and Matungu constituencies as well as senatorial seat poll in Machakos county because of the unity brought by the Building Bridges Initiative.Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju has said he is waiting for a decision from the party's disciplinary committee, which will be forwarded to the National Management Committee and the National Executive Council for a final resolution.Cherargei further said ODM leadership met on Wednesday after suspecting that Jubilee might throw them under the bus.“ ODM has realised that time is running out and that they need to put their house in order. For us, Ruto has placed himself strategically to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta,” added the Nandi senator."
244,"Kenya, Algeria call for extension of Amisom mandate in Somalia","Kenya and Algeria have called for the extension of Amisom mandate in Somalia.In a joint communique between Kenya's Foreign Affairs CS Raychelle Omamo and her Algeria counterpart Sabri Boukadoum, the two countries said Amisom has played a key role in pacifying Somalia and ridding the country of terror groups including the al-Shabaab.The Ministers noted that Amisom continues to experience challenges especially in respect to predictable funding including lack of force multipliers and enablers.""And in this regard, the ministers urged the United Nations to consider financing Amisom through UN assessed contributions,"" read part of the communique seen by the Star.The ministers also took note of the threat of Al-Shabab which remains potent and called on the AU and the UN to renew the mandate of Amisom, taking into account that sufficient capacity has not been built within the Somalia National Security services to take over the functions currently undertaken by Amisom troops.In October last year, the Star reported that the Somalia National Defence Forces will soon have to take over the security of their country.The reality of KDF exiting Somalia by this year has started taking shape. The Star established that the troops under Amisom have started gearing up for an exit.This will likely bring to an end a decade of KDF’s presence in Somalia under Amisom’s Concept of Operations (Conops).Since Amisom took over military operations, its mandate has primarily been geared towards empowering the Somali Security Forces (SSF) through mentorship.Multiple sources at the Department of Defence told the Star that currently, Somali forces are increasingly conducting independent operations, following mentorship by respective troops under Amisom.According to the sources, Amisom has been conducting Operational Readiness Assessments (ORA) annually across Somalia.The purpose of the assessment has been to establish the manning levels, standards of training and capability in each region.“From the assessment reports, it is apparent that the SSF have attained a reasonable degree of capacity but still require more support and time to achieve optimal readiness,” the source said.The source said much has been done towards achieving Amisom's mandate towards the Somali Transition Plan (STP), but there is still more work to be done.The Transition Plan has continued to guide the conduct of operations towards a stable and safe Somalia.“Ultimately, it is the desire of all parties to see to fruition the handover of security responsibilities to the Federal Government of Somalia,” the source said.According to the senior military personnel, Amisom troops drawdown has necessitated increased involvement of SSF in operations and management of security in a number of areas.However, the troops continue to maintain a presence in key areas as part of the transition plan, and the exit will not be one-off but progressive.The Conops contain a clear breakdown of how the Amisom troops should operate towards a gradual handover to the Somali forces.Though the guidelines seen by the Star do not indicate an actual date when the troops exit in 2021, the sources said KDF troops have been on a rigorous exercise, mentoring Somali forces through joint operations that will see them take over.“Our troops have been conducting joint offensive operations to degrade al Shabaab. In the operations, the aim has been to ensure Somalia forces are on the front line as we support them to remain tactical and professional,” another source said.This, he said, is key to helping the Somali forces understand the scope of operations and the type of enemy they are dealing with.According to Conops, the exit will be conducted gradually to allow a smooth transition.In this context, the two ministers reiterated the importance of providing African solutions to African problems and agreed on the need to enhance AU efforts to Silence Guns in Africa, in coordination with its partners, including the United Nations.Boukadoum congratulated Kenya on taking up its seat at the United Nations Security Council as a Non-Permanent Member for the period 2021-2022.He assured of Algeria’s support to, and solidarity with Kenya for a successful tenure at the Security Council and expressed support for Kenya’s efforts to promote Africa’s voice and defend the continent’s just causes and principled positions for a safer and more prosperous world.The Minister further paid tribute to Kenya’s role as a current member of the African Union Peace and Security Council, and as a Bureau Member of the African Union, especially in coordinating efforts to provide adequate and timely AU responses to the challenges faced during the past year, including the Covid-19 pandemic.The two ministers reviewed the state of the bilateral relations and, on this occasion underlined with satisfaction the quality of the cooperation between the two countries, in several areas, including exploring new realms of collaboration.The ministers noted that the said cooperation is yet to reach its fullest potential and results, and, therefore, agreed to join efforts to explore opportunities for expansion of the cooperation in the areas of economic, trade and investments.Both ministers also discussed and exchanged views on the political, peace and security situation in Africa, and expressed convergent views and concerns about the instability and conflict in some parts of the continent, including in Libya, Mali, the Sahel region, the DRC, CAR and in parts of the Horn of Africa Region as well as on the global threat of terrorism and extremism which they condemned in the strongest terms possible.The duo called for more efforts to stop the increasing and extremely worrying spread of terrorism in all regions of the continent, including through upholding international norms with regards to the prohibition of payment of a ransom to terrorists."
245,"'Shouting, interjecting Havi':Advocate wants nine LSK members suspended","An Advocate wants nine LSK Council members suspended from practice on grounds of professional misconduct.  Hellen Ringera has filed a complaint against Aluso Ingati, Roseline Odede, Faith Odhiambo, George Omwansa, Carolyne Mutheu, Bernard Ngetich, Ndinda Kinyili, Beth Michoma, Riziki Emukule and Mercy Wambua before the Advocates Disciplinary Committee. Ringera has faulted the advocates for the manner in which they conducted themselves during the Law Society of Kenya Special General meeting (SGM) held on January 18,2021.  She says their actions have brought ridicule and disrepute to LSK which can only be remedied by them being suspended from practice.In the affidavit, Ingati has been accused of switching off the microphone of the President of LSK Nelson Havi during the SGM in order to stop him from chairing the meeting.“She further moved from her designated seat, stood in front of Havi, sat on top of his laptop and files and engaged in a dramatic shouting match to distract Havi from chairing the meeting,”Ringera said.Other advocates including Odede, Odhiambo,  Omwansa,  Mutheu, Ngetich,  Kinyili, Michoma,  and Emukule have also been accused of interjecting without any just reason when Havi was chairing the meeting.These advocates also engaged in a shouting match to stop Havi from chairing the meeting.  The said advocates have since been suspended from the council.Their suspension paints a bleak future for the society’s organization as its council-highest decision making organ-now lacks a quorum to transact business.  In addition, Ringera in her affidavit before the committee has raised a number of complaints which she says amount to professional misconduct.  Among them is how the suspended council members unlawfully committed the LSK to spend Sh 662,000 on account of unbudgeted expenses incurred by the Public Interest Litigation Committee on the Legal Awareness Week on 9 November last year. She says 11 days later, the advocates further unlawfully approved the payment by LSK of Sh 713,863 on account of expenses incurred by the Public Interest Litigation Committee on the Legal Awareness week. Factional wars in the Law Society of Kenya was laid bare on Monday as passions flared, degenerating its special general meeting into a chaotic shouting match.What was intended to be an orderly gathering was reduced to heckles. Only friendly voices were allowed to speak.It all ended in the resignation of one council member, Roseline Odede, and a vote by acclamation to suspend eight members not aligned to president Nelson Havi.Also suspended was Mercy Wambua—the society's chief executive who has been at loggerheads with Havi since last year."
246,Woman arrested for stealing one-month-old baby in Homabay,"A one-month-old baby, who had been stolen from his mother three weeks ago has been rescued and the suspect arrested.Baby Stanley Decimal was stolen from Benta Achieng, at a Salon in Rodi Kopany in Homabay County.""Shockingly, the suspect identified as Bella Achieng Ogolla, had met Benta in hospital days before she delivered only to steal the baby later,"" DCI Director George Kinoti said.Via Social media on Friday, Kinoti said detectives are still trying to figure out how the suspect managed to convince her 42-year-old husband Bernard Akello, that she was pregnant all along and had finally bore him a son.The baby has so far been re-united to his biological mother.Kinoti said the rescue was made possible by detectives from the Crime Research & Intelligence Bureau and officers from the Child Protection Unit.Last year, a couple was arrested for allegedly stealing a baby boy from Ndhiwa Subcounty Hospital in Homa Bay.Janet Achieng, 25, and her 32-year-old husband were arrested after they were found with the child in their house in Rongo town.The two-months-old baby is said to have been stolen from his mother Beatrice Achieng’ when she took him for a post-natal clinic."
247,Kalonzo to appear at DCI offices over 'Yatta land grabbing' claims,"Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka is expected at the DCI headquarters on Friday over claims he grabbed Yatta land.The accusation was made by Deputy President William Ruto in Bomet last Friday.He claimed Kalonzo grabbed a 200-acre government land in Yatta which belonged to the NYS.But Kalonzo dismissed the claims as wild and constituted character assassination.In a communique on Friday, Kalonzo will present himself at 8:30am to 9am at the DCI concerning the ownership of the land.He will be having in his possession all the legal/official documents showing how he acquired the said property.Kalonzo said Ruto to follow suit and present himself before the same authorities for scrutiny.Kalonzo’s utterances have caused mixed reactions as politicians allied to the Deputy President rushed to defend Ruto while those allied to Musyoka defended the Ukambani political kingpin.Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu defended Musyoka, stating the attack on him was ill-advised."
248,"Fake laptop tender deal was signed in DP's office, says witness","A director of a firm at the centre of a fake laptop tender at Deputy President William Ruto’s office has told court he was cheated into believing the deal was genuine.Charles Musinga of Makindu Motors said a woman introduced to him as Miss Muhoro by a friend he identified as Augustine Matata, was to facilitate the tender at the DP’s office. They were to supply 2,800 laptops.“Miss Muhoro also said she was the secretary of a Mr Wanyonyi who was the personal assistant to the Deputy President,” Musinga told court.He told chief magistrate Martha Mutuku that Muhoro would later arrange a meeting in her office at Harambee House Annex to pursue the supply tender.Musinga testified on Thursday in a case in which seven people have been charged with a fake laptop tender. The suspects are Allan Chesang'; Teddy Owiti; Kevin Nyongesa; Augustine Matata; Joy Kamau; James Makokha, alias Mr Wanyonyi; and Johan Osore.On May 30, 2018, Musinga, Matata and a third man only identified as Solomon drove and arrived at Harambee Avenue at 8 am. They parked their car and sat waiting at a Java House outlet next to Harambee House Annexe as Muhoro had instructed. They were to wait for her call.The call came and they were led into Harambee House Annex via the VIP lift. They landed on the third floor. Musinga said a fake business deal was the last thing that could cross his mind, least of all being engineered at the DP's office.They found Miss Muhoro seated and she confirmed his firm had been shortlisted to supply laptops to the Ministry of Devolution. She even handed them non-disclosure agreement forms. They were barred from discussing the deal with anyone.Musinga said his confidence got a boost by virtue of getting into Harambee House Annex. They would later meet Miss Muhoro at a hotel in Karen, which he says he was informed belonged to Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju.Miss Muhoro demanded Sh500,000 broker fees. They gave her the cash.On June 19, they met with her again, but this time, she was with her “boss Wanyonyi” at Ole Sereni Hotel where she gave them a local purchase order that indicated they were to supply 2,800 laptops.They found a supplier and the first batch of 145 laptops they were informed by Miss Muhoro to supply at the Treasury Building.“We were flagged by uniformed police and when they enquired we told them we were bringing the DP's laptops and they said they were aware, and let us through…We uploaded the goods and there were uniformed policemen to confirm the order,” he said.They later went to the 8th floor at the Ministry of Devolution where they met Christian Mwendwa who signed the delivery order. Given that they could not get more laptops of HP 7th generation, they requested that they supply an alternative. The request was accepted.They supplied the second batch of 587 pieces, which they were told to take to Eastleigh at their offices where they were informed a “Mr Kiptoo, who was also a DP Ruto's aide"", collect the consignment.According to the prosecution, Kiptoo is Allan Chesang—the first accused person in the case. The court heard that Kiptoo, alias Chesang, went under police escort, driving a state-of-the-art Range Rover with stickers of Parliament and the Office of the Deputy President.Chesang also collected the third batch of 500 laptops and the fourth batch of 620 through the same method.After delivering all the pieces, Miss Muhoro invited them with the chairman, Mr Wanyonyi, at Ole Sereni and told them they had done a good job and they would land another tender to supply ambulances.Musinga will be cross-examined on February 15.In December, businessman Stephen Ngei Musyoka, the other director of Makindu Motors, told magistrate Mutuku that he, alongside his co-director, received an email from the Office of the DP confirming that they had won the tender.He told the court he lost Sh181 million.“My co-director Charles and I received an email from the Office of the DP confirming that they had received our profile and were ready to work with us in the year 2019-20 for the supply of laptops as direct sourcing to the Ministry of Devolution,” he said.Two representatives of Makindu Motors were invited to the Office of the DP for a meeting to finalise the deal. They were ushered in by one Mr Osore—one of the accused persons.The two signed a non-disclosure agreement that had the official logo of the Office of the DP. Musyoka said they later had a meeting in Karen with two of the accused persons—Matata and Wangare, who introduced herself as Miss Muhoro and a procurement officer at the Office of the DP."
249,Uproar as IEBC asks Kenyans to verify BBI signatures,"The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has sparked outrage with its call upon Kenyans to verify whether they indeed signed in support of the BBI referendum.Allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga have slammed the IEBC move, saying its reeks of sabotage.The electoral agency has in recent weeks come under pressure for alleged slow verification of signatures that could derail the referendum timelines.On Thursday, the electoral commission, in a notice published after verification of about 1.3 million signatures, asked voters to confirm if they indeed signed.“Anyone who has been captured as a supporter without their consent can report to the commission by writing to the CEO indicating their objections.”IEBC asked aggrieved signatories to submit the reservations by email or hand-delivery by Monday close of business.However, Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo and his Ndaragwa counterpart Jeremiah Kioni questioned the decision.The lawmakers – who are leaders of key House committees on the referendum process - said the commission was acting in a manner that invites unnecessary antagonism.“Their role is to do the verification. We caution the IEBC not to be seen to be inviting unnecessary antagonism. They must ensure that the things they do are not laced with suspicion,” Kioni said.“They have to win the confidence of the public. If they have gotten the minimum, they should not be seen to be trying to drag the process,” the Constitution Implementation Oversight Committee chairman said.Otiende Amollo, who is vice chair of the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee, said the development demonstrated the need for urgent reforms at the IEBC.“The more they do this, the more they give everyone a good reason to remove them,” the lawmaker said.He backed Kioni’s sentiments, saying after verifying one million records, there was no point to delay the process further.Amolo said the IEBC was “behaving queerly”, citing the difference in the way it handled the Punguza Mzigo Initiative signatures. “At that time they did not ask for money to verify. Strangely enough when it came to BBI, they insisted they wouldn’t move without money and the amount was grossly exaggerated,” the MP said.IEBC had sought Sh241 million for the verification before they negotiated with the National Treasury for Sh97.3 million.The MP said it was strange that the commission has taken inordinately long with the BBI signatures compared to the speed at which they dealt with the Ekuru Aukot-led process.“Punguza was done quickly and quietly. For this, they were seeking a longer period. The assertion is curious.“Although, they were given 4.2 million, the Constitution requires one million hence there is no need to verify the rest after getting to the threshold.”Amolo said that IEBC having indicated that it lacked a database of signatures, the verification was limited to counterchecking if the name of the person listed is a registered voter.“Anything beyond that is not provided for in law and is not accurate. Since they don’t have a database of signatures, they have nothing to check against.”Their sentiments followed after poll experts lamented the slow pace of the verification.They asked the commission “to hasten the process of verification to avert any speculation that would continue to spark political reactions.”The team is also alarmed by the intermittent breakdown in internet connectivity at the Bomas of Kenya, which is housing the 400 clerks conducting the verification.During signature collection, Deputy President William Ruto’s allies claimed that voters were being coerced by provincial administrators to sign for the BBI Bill.Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung’wa, Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua and former PSCU digital strategist Dennis Itumbi, raised the claims.BBI promoters said the IEBC’s assertions for checks on whether consent of voters was sought rang an alarm bell.Edited by Henry Makori"
250,"Raila intensifies attacks on Ruto, says DP cannot be trusted","ODM leader Raila Odinga on Thursday hightened his onslaught on Deputy President William Ruto over Jubilee's unfulfilled 2017 election promises.Speaking during a tour of Westlands and Dagoretti North constituencies in Nairobi, Raila said Ruto cannot be trusted to bring meaningful change in the country.He said it was laughable that an administration that campaigned on the platform of digitising the economy had resorted to giving out wheelbarrows to Kenyans.""They said we (Nasa) are analogue and that they are digital, now they are distributing wheelbarrows and handcarts,"" Raila said.Ruto has previously told off Raila and insisted that the ODM leader had no new ideas.Raila on Thursday made a BBI popularisation tour in the two Nairobi constituencies calling on Kenyans to shun the class war he alleged was being propagated by Ruto.He appealed to Kenyans to back BBI which he noted offers sustainable solutions to challenges facing Kenyans.""Do not give the youths handcarts and wheelbarrows.  These youths need sustainable solutions. What is the use of wheelbarrows in Nairobi?"" Raila said.President Uhuru has also warned that the 'hustler' narrative would set a dangerous precedent in the country.The Head of State said there was no way that one can deal with the issues facing Kenyans by dividing them along the class lines.Ruto has gone full throttle in his ‘hustler nation’ campaigns, a movement which he says seeks to empower the poor across the country.But Raila accused him of failing to deliver in government and using unquestionable wealth to run the programme.He cited laptops for primary school pupils and one million jobs to the youth as some of Jubilee's unfulfilled promises.The Deputy President has been meeting delegations and giving them items such as handcarts, washing machines, water tanks and wheelbarrows.The DP’s critics argue that the donations will have very little impact on the lives of the beneficiaries and the country.Raila said BBI will bring the third and final liberation that the country needs to catch up with its peers in the world, which have advanced economically.Raila made stopovers at Waruku, St Joseph's Thiong'o junction, New Market and Kangemi flyover.""BBI will bring a lasting solution to the youths of this country and it is the third and final liberation of the country,"" he said.He was accompanied by area MP Timothy Wanyonyi, Maina Kamanda (nominated), Antony Oluoch (Mathare), Babu Owino (Embakasi East), Esther Passaris (Nairobi MP), Millie Odhiambo (Suba North) and  Simba Arati (Dagoretti North).Others were  Godfrey Osotsi (nominated) George Aladwa (Makadara), Senator George Khaniri (Vihiga) and ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna, TJ Kajwang' (Ruaraka), Caleb Amisi (Saboti) and Nairobi politician Reuben Ndolo."
251,Knut wants TSC boss Macharia jailed for disobeying court order,"Knut wants Teachers Service Commission secretary Nancy Macharia punished for disobeying a court order that suspended the implementation of career progression guidelines. The Kenya National Union of Teachers, in an urgent application, says the TSC and its secretary have issued a fresh circular declaring vacancies in line with the guidelines despite a court decision by Justice Byrum Ongaya that suspended the same in July 2019.  In August 2019, another advertisement in the dailies invited applications from suitably qualified candidates through career progression guidelines to fill the positions of headteacher and deputy headteacher 2 in utter disobedience of the court order. Though advocate Hillary Sigei, Knut says Ongaya’s orders of 2019 are still in force and have not been reviewed or set aside. “Despite being aware of a pending application for contempt, TSC has continued to place advertisements and issued circulars for implementation, including inviting applications from suitably qualified candidates through the career progression guidelines to fill vacancies created.""It wants TSC and its CEO/secretary committed to jail for six months. Also sought is an order restraining any implementation of the guidelines. In his decision delivered in 2019, Justice Ongaya of the Labour and Employment Relations Court directed the teachers' employer to effect promotions based on its code of regulations. “TSC will undertake promotions in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Code of Regulations for Teachers and the schemes of service with respect to all unionisable teachers,” he said.The unions had opposed a performance-based progression module adopted by TSC that Knut said would disenfranchise some 50,000 teachers due for promotions having pursued further studies. The commission, on the other hand, had maintained that promotions could only be effected based on the new guidelines that review the performance of a teacher as opposed to seniority, academic and professional qualification as suggested by Knut."
252,Mudavadi to Ruto: Matungu is not Msambweni,"ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has said Deputy President William Ruto's candidate in the Matungu by-election has no chance of winning the March 4 poll.Mudavadi said Ruto would not make the slightest impression in Matungu, or in the other by-election in Kabuchai constituency.“Matungu is not Msambweni in KwLE. Things are very different there. Do not assume that you will use the same tactics you used in Msambweni,” he said.Mudavadi explained that the situation in Matungu and Kabuchai is totally different from Msambweni where Ruto’s candidate brushed aside ODM’s attempt to retain the seat.Ruto threw his weight behind Feisal Bader after the ruling Jubilee Party announced that it would not field a candidate.Bader, who contested as an independent candidate, trounced ODM’s Omar Boga. He garnered 15,251 votes against Boga's 10,444.“Propaganda will not work. Issues to do with cane farming and agriculture among others are what the people want to hear there. These two elections will shock Kenyans,” he said.However, Ruto's allies in the Western region expressed confidence that their candidates in the two polls will emerge victorious.“I am on the ground and I know what is happening. We will definitely win the two elections,” Sirisia MP John Waluke said.Waluke said their candidates are popular and resonate with locals well.The newly formed United Democratic Alliance (UDA), which is associated with Ruto, has fielded Alex Lanya in Matungu and Evans Kakai in Kabuchai.ANC has Peter Nabulindo in Matungu but will not be fielding a candidate in Kabuchai. The party will be rallying behind Ford Kenya's Joseph Majimbo.Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula are in a deal to ensure they do not lose Matungu and Kabuchai seatsThe two face a bruising battle in Kabuchai as the constituency borders Ruto-allied MPs Waluke, Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Fred Kapondi (Mt Elgon) and Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula).As in Msambweni, Jubilee will not field candidates in Machakos, Matungu and Kabuchai by-elections. The party said the decision was courtesy of the unity brought about by the Building Bridges Initiative.In a statement, Mudavadi and Wetang'ula said they intend to use the Matungu and Kabuchai polls as a springboard to consolidate votes in Western region ahead of the 2022 General Elections.“In these by-elections, this is the Unity Team. Anyone outside the unity of ANC and Ford Kenya is a traitor, enemy and project against the Mulembe Nation,” Mudavadi said.Wetang'ula said the candidates against them are the projects of outsiders, sponsored to break the unity resolve of Western Kenya.“It will be a deliberate statement to the people of Mulembe nation and Kenya at large that this region is no longer available for political experiments,” Wetang'ula said.Mudavadi said the partnership of Ford Kenya and ANC will deliver wonders for the people of Western Kenya(Edited by o.o.)"
253,Ministry sets up complaints desk for land conversion,"The Ministry of Lands has set up a complaints desk at the customer care centre within Ardhi House to handle complaints arising from the conversion of parcels.In a statement on Thursday, Lands CS Farida Karoney said any person with an interest in land within the registration unit and is aggrieved by the information on the notice is advised to lodge their complaints with the registrar.“Interested parties shall lodge a complaint with the registrar through the ministry's offices at Ardhi House at no cost,” Karoney said.She said the complainant will be required to complete forms LRA 96 set out in the second schedule to the land registration order 2017, or LRA 67 set out in the sixth schedule to the land registration General regulations, 2017.The forms are available in the help desk and can also be downloaded from the ministry’s website.“Certified copies of the title, copy of identification card, P.I.N, contact address and the telephone number should be attached,” she said.Karoney said the complainant will be recorded by the registrar who receives the complaint and assigned a case reference number to facilitate follow up.“Complainant shall be regularly advised on the progress of their complaints. The ministry may issue additional information through our website from time to time,” she said.On January 12, the ministry announced that all land ownership documents issued before the enactment of the Land Registration Act 2012 will be cancelled before issuing new ones.Karoney said the cancellation and replacement will migrate the parcels to the new regime while retaining the ownership, size, and other interests registered against the respective title.She said the registrar will retain the old title documents for record and safe custody and assured land and property owners that great care will be taken to protect their property rights.Karoney said there are several pieces of legislation on land registration, a move that has made land registration complex.The CS said the promulgation of the Constitution in 2010 required Parliament to revise, consolidate, and rationalise land registration regimes.“The confusion occasioned by the different regimes has become a breeding ground for fraud, delays in service delivery, centralisation of land services, and threats to the right to property‚” she said.Land Registration Act 2012 was enacted in 2012, repealing all other land registration statutes.The move unified the registration regime in under this statute. The country has however not migrated to the exclusive use of the Land Registration Act 2012.The conversion process entails the preparation of cadastral maps together with a conversion list indicating the new and old numbers for parcels of land within a registration unit or registration section and their corresponding acreages.Karoney said the objective of the conversion is to collapse land registration processes in the repealed land registration laws into one and will mean full use of Registry Index Maps as registration instruments, replacing the deed plans.“Boundaries will not be affected since Registry Index Maps are generated from survey plans with fixed boundaries. Both the Registry Index Maps and survey plans are accessible to landowners on request for verification of boundary details at the Survey of Kenya headquarters in Ruaraka,” she said.Karoney said the use of Registry Index Maps will minimise land fraud.The CS said title documents held by third parties including banks, hospitals, courts as security at the time of commencement will be replaced upon application by the proprietor.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
254,Nurses now want work deal signed by national government,"Nurses have halted all the negotiations initiated at the county government level and want the return-to-work formula signed at the national level.The decision was arrived at by the Kenya National Union of Nurses national governing council during a meeting held on Wednesday to review progress since the start of the strike on December 7.The nurses and clinical officers have been on strike, with lab technologists joining the strike early this month.“The national governing council of the union is the supreme organ of the union and it makes final decisions on all matters affecting the union,” KNUN secretary general Seth Panyako said.“In the meeting, it was agreed that the return-to-work formula that was negotiated at the national level and agreed by the two levels of government must be signed  at the national level, hence all the negotiations that might be, have been or are yet to be initiated at the county government level are thereby stopped by the decree of the national governing council.”It was also agreed that the Central Organisation of Trade Unions continue supporting the three unions whose members are on strike until a proper return-to-work formula is signed.Panyako said the union will organise regional demonstrations beginning on Monday to push their grievances to be addressed with the urgency they deserve.The unions and the multi-agency committee arrived at an agreement after talks between the parties, but the Council of Governors has remained adamant it will not sign the document.It had been agreed that the risk allowance for nurses be reviewed to a minimum of Sh15,000.Dependents of nurses who have or may succumb to Covid-19 and other illnesses as well as accidents before the operationalisation of Comprehensive Group Life, Last Expense and Enhanced Work Injury Benefits as provided for by NHIF shall receive compensation by the employer within the two levels of government.To date, 34 nurses have succumbed to Covid-19 while on duty. Healthcare workers went on strike to push for, among other issues, a risk allowance, adequate personal protective equipment, comprehensive medical insurance cover and payment of delayed salaries.""We know what Kenyans are going through at this particular time and as a union, it is not and has never and will never be our position to attain and have a position of grandstanding and not willing to engage,” Panyako said.“But the nurses are very clear that their issues must be resolved and the only way to show that is through a proper return to work agreement addressing how those issues have been resolved or how they are going to be resolved. Nothing absolutely out of work will take nurses back to work.”The nurses also hit out at the Council of Governors for claiming that they are the best-paid professionals in the country.They termed it rather demeaning to be compared to other professions yet it is claimed than more than Sh2 billion is lost to corruption daily.“Let us not talk about the health sector eating the money. It is corruption that is eating the money. . If they knew they could not manage the health sector, why did they hurriedly take it? Return it to the national government,” Panyako said.The nurses welcomed the move by religious leaders to arbitrate in the health dispute, saying they are open to dialogue with the two levels of government to end the stalemate.Edited by Henry Makori"
255,MP Alex Kosgey joins the hustler movement,"Emgwen MP Alex Kosgey has thrown his support behind Deputy President William Ruto and signalled joining the hustler movement.The son of veteran politician and former Cabinet minister Henry Kosgey also declared he would defend his seat in next year’s polls.“We are all in the wheelbarrow [party] and we should stand for peace, unity and stability as we all try and come out of various situations in life,” Kosgey said.The youthful legislator dismissed talk the hustler movement can cause class wars between the rich and poor in the country. “The hustler nation is not about dividing but uniting all people regardless of class. Stop this narrative of class war which doesn’t exist. End this notion of entitlement,” Kosgey said.He spoke on Thursday in Kapsabet as he distributed Sh55 million NG-CDF cash for the expansion of various schools in his constituency.“Let each party sell its policies and stop demonising others simply because you think you are entitled to lead. Leadership is decided by the people themselves and we should not incite others,” the MP said.Kosgey’s elder brother Allan Kosgey is expected to contest against incumbent Governor Stephen Sang for Nandi county’s top job.The lawmaker said the country was faced with serious social, economic and political issues due to various challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic.Kosgey said schools were facing problems in keeping with the Ministry of Health protocols to control the spread of the coronavirus.“However, with the NG-CDF kitty, we shall ensure we utilise the funds to expand and increase the number of classes and other infrastructure as we insist on face masks and handwashing in all schools,”  Kosgey said.Nandi county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding ordered chiefs to ensure all children return to school – even those who are pregnant.“Pregnancy is not a disease, lets allow all the girls to return to class after delivery of their babies but those responsible for the pregnancies would face the full force of the law,” Omoding said. (edited by o. owino)"
256,Covid cases and deaths to peak in March — Kemri,"Scientists have projected that Covid-19 cases and deaths are likely to peak in mid-March, with large numbers to come from schools.Experts from the Kenya Medical Research Institute estimate there will be between 10,600 and 16,800 new Covid-19 cases and 116 more deaths by June 1.  They project the reopening of schools on January 4 may cause a rise of the transmission rate by 25 per cent.“We predict that by mid-February the impact of schools opening should be clear in terms of case numbers,” the experts said.The scientists say more than 1.1 million infections could occur over the same period, with the large majority of infections going undetected.“A worst-case scenario would be an increase in transmission rate by 50 per cent and resulting in an epidemic of similar magnitude to the second outbreak in the country. We think this is unlikely,” Kemri said in a statement Thursday.This report comes barely two weeks after Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the government will not declare the curve flattened despite a consistent infection rate below five per cent.“Under normal circumstances and given the positivity rate we have been experiencing over the last one or two weeks we would be thinking about the declaration of a flattened curve,” Kagwe said.However, he said, the government had yet to consider the impact of the holiday season and reopening of schools.Consequently, the containment measures such as the curfew would remain, he said.Kemri said the 25 per cent increase in transmission rate will depend on whether other restrictions are still in place and level of precaution taken in schools.The scientists said that the surge experienced in October and November was caused by the relaxation of restrictions and increased movement.Community spread of Covid-19 into rural Kenya than in the first wave was also a factor.“This model needs updating with the latest data on negative test numbers and to add information on the age distribution on cases and deaths in Kenya,” they said.“These improvements are also required for medium-term forecasts of vaccine effectiveness in Kenya. This stage of model improvements is expected to be completed by early February.”The experts applied models that predicted the pattern of the first peak of Covid-19 cases in late July last year but did not predict the second peak in November 2020.On Wednesday, acting Health director-general Patrick Amoth confirmed that two cases of the new variant in South Africa had been picked by Kemri teams.The two people who tested positive for the variant, both men, were asymptomatic and had returned to their country. He did not name the country. “This was picked because of heightened surveillance system and at the point of picking them they were all asymptomatic,” Amoth said. (edited by o. owino)"
257,"15 officers, their boss be charged for curfew beatings","At 7.15pm on March 30 last year, police enforcing a nationwide 7pm curfew hurled tear gas canisters into the home of Bernard Orenga in Nambale.They then stormed the homestead and beat him up with his wife and children. They also beat up his neighbours.Orenga’s was the experience of many Kenyans across the country. Now, the public prosecutor wants the officers prosecuted.Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has announced criminal charges against the officers.Fifteen police officers and six Busia county enforcement officers will be arraigned and charged with assault during Covid-19 curfew operations.Police watchdog Ipoa has said other charges will include causing actual bodily harm, malicious damage to property and attempting to injure by an explosive substance.""Additionally, the Ward Commander who led the operation will also be charged with the offence of negligence in the discharge of official duty,"" IPoa chair Anne Makori said.The officers will take plea on February 1 in Bungoma.The authority is still investigating incidents that happened during the curfew.  Already, the policeman who shot and killed 13-year-old Yassin Moyo in Huruma has been charged with murder."
258,Western promised steady power supply by March,"Kenya Power has promised customers in western Kenya steady power supply by March.Power supply has been unreliable in the region, leaving many businesses and domestic consumers suffering.Managing director Bernard Ngugi said the company is working round the clock to stabilise supply within the region. He said they have many customers and the company must not lose the opportunity to sell electricity to them. Ngugi on Thursday announced that a new line from Olkaria-Lessos terminating in Kisumu will be ready beginning March, which will end blackouts in the region.“This is coming with a message from our CS Charles Keter that in the beginning of March this will be a problem of the past,” Ngugi said.The MD said the company loses huge revenues whenever there is a blackout within the region.“This is a matter that is of concern to us. The government is fully aware of the challenges faced by the public during outages and everything is being done to remedy the situation,” he told the media during the launch of the Smart Metering Project in Kisumu.Ngugi was responding to a concern raised by the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kisumu chapter chairman Israel Agina on the losses businesspeople incur in the region during blackouts.Agina told Kenya Power to look into a long-term solution to the matter, which they have raised over time.KETRACO is currently implementing the Olkaria – Lessos - Kisumu transmission project, which entails the construction of a double-circuit transmission line between Olkaria II and Kisumu substations via Lessos substation.The project traverses Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, Nandi and Kisumu counties.The line is expected to transmit geothermal power from the fields in Olkaria to Western Kenya.Consumers say the power supply to western Kenya is unreliable and expensive and there is a need to connect the region to the reliable geothermal supply to avoid downtimes and reduce the cost.Edited by Henry Makori"
259,Biden to sign 10 executive orders to tackle Covid-19,"President Joe Biden is set to sign 10 executive orders to boost the fight against Covid which has ravaged the US.Vaccination will be accelerated and testing increased. Emergency legislation will be used to increase production of essentials like masks.In a break with former President Donald Trump, the policy stresses a national strategy rather than relying on states to decide what is best.The moves comes a day after Mr Biden was sworn in as the 46th president.The Trump administration was widely accused of failing to get to grips with the pandemic.In terms of total deaths from coronavirus, the US is the worst-hit country with more than 406,000 lives lost according to Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 24.5 million have been infected.What's in the plan?In his inauguration speech, Mr Biden warned that the coronavirus pandemic in the US was entering its ""deadliest period"".Mr Biden's Covid-19 task force co-ordinator, Jeff Zients, told reporters that under Mr Trump there was no strategy at federal level and a comprehensive approach was lacking.""As President Biden steps into office today, that all changes,"" he said.The administration unveiled a seven-point plan which included efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing.""The American people deserve an urgent, robust and professional response to the growing public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak,"" an introduction to the plan said.It said Mr Biden believed the government ""must act swiftly and aggressively to help protect and support"" essential workers and the most vulnerable.The aim is to give 100 million vaccine doses by the end of April, and reopen most schools safely within 100 days.Vaccine centres will be established at stadiums and community facilities.There will be more funding for state and local officials to help tackle the pandemic, and a new office will be established to co-ordinate the national response.The Defense Production Act will be used to speed up production of personal protective equipment and essential supplies needed for vaccine production. Mr Trump used the same piece of legislation to compel the production of items in short supply last year.On top of the already announced rules on wearing masks and social distancing on all federal government property, face coverings will become mandatory on many planes and trains.""What we're inheriting is so much worse than we could have imagined,"" Mr Zients said.In a further break with the previous administration, Mr Biden's chief medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, said the US would join the Covax scheme designed to deliver Covid vaccines to poor countries.Speaking by video call to the World Health Organization in Geneva, Dr Fauci also stressed that the US would continue to provide funding for the WHO, in line with Mr Biden's move to reverse Mr Trump's decision to leave.What happened on Wednesday?Only hours after being sworn in, Mr Biden signed 15 executive orders, including reversing Mr Trump's policies on climate change and immigration.Few were present to witness the oaths and ceremonies due to coronavirus restrictions.Donald Trump, who has still not formally conceded the presidency to Mr Biden, snubbed the event in a departure from longstanding tradition.""Democracy has prevailed,"" President Biden said after taking the oath of office in front of the US Capitol.A major theme of his inauguration speech was unity after the major divisions laid bare during the Trump administration.Mr Biden promised to be a president ""for all Americans"", including those who voted against him.How have world leaders reacted?Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is the latest world leader to react to Mr Biden taking office, saying ""there is a much broader scope for political accord with President Biden"".She said the climate crisis, coronavirus and security were issues ready to be addressed by the US, Germany and Europe.China reacted through its ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai.""China looks forward to working with the new administration to promote sound and steady development of China-US relations and jointly address global challenges in public health, climate change and growth,"" he said.Russian Ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said: ""I would like to believe that a new chapter in the development of the United States of America begins today and, of course, that a new chapter in the development of Russian-American relations begins as well. At least, we have repeatedly spoken about this."""
260,Treasury to dig deeper to settle lecturers' payment deal,"Treasury has been directed to make additional budgetary allocations to settle the pending varsities salary row.Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Maureen Anyango on Thursday said a decision by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission to cap the budget for university lecturers at Sh8.8 billion was not sufficient to implement their collective bargaining agreements signed last year. As a result, she directed SRC, to work together with the Inter Public Universities Councils Consultative Forum (IPUCCF) committee, the Ministry  of Education and Treasury to make necessary additional  budgetary  allocations to enable public universities implement the CBAs. The court confirmed that the computation by IPUCCF was accurate and that the figure of Sh8.8 billion is not sufficient to implement the CBAs.This is so because it did not include the annual increments and the resultant pension liabilities payable by IPUCCF.  According to the court records, the original proposal by the unions was to cost Sh38.5 billion to implement. But SRC said the implementation must be undertaken within the allocation of Sh8.8 billion. It said the tabulation by the implementation committee which indicated the implementation as Sh13 billion is erroneous. Judge Onyango in her judgement said SRC arrived at the figure of Sh8.8 billion based on horizontal implementation of the CBA meaning that the SRC excluded an annual increment.  ""CBAs signed and registered as well as the computation by the implementation committees of the universities is correct and is based on the unaltered matrix as presented to IPUCCF by SRC,"" said the Judge."

266,Former KPA MD Manduku enters Kisii Governor race,"Former Kenya Ports Authority Managing Director Daniel Manduku has plunged into politics after declaring his interest in the Kisii County Governor seat.Manduku becomes the latest candidate to enter the crowded race to replace James Ongwae who will complete his two terms next year.He confirmed to the Star that he is in the race and has already formed his political vehicle the Party of Economic Democracy.He is the interim party leader. Manduku resigned from KPA in March last year. He was charged six months later in a graft case.Manduku is among 2022 governor candidates using the March 4 Kiamokama ward by-election to test waters ahead of the 2022 elections.“PED has fielded a strong candidate in Kiamokama ward by-elections. We shall use the mini poll to test waters ahead of 2022 because the outcome will have an impact in the general elections,” said Manduku.The party has fielded former provincial administrator Daniel Ondabu in the mini poll.He is among 11 candidates who were cleared to contest the by-election.The seat fell vacant following the death of Kennedy Mainya in November last year.He vowed to galvanize the community behind PED ahead of the general elections.“The Kisii community should have their vehicle ahead of 2022. Rallying behind one political party to increase their bargaining power after the 2022 polls,” he added.Manduku is among governor aspirants using the high stake by-election as a launching pad for their 2022 governor bid.Other candidates seeking to replace Ongwae are Senator Sam Ongeri, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Nyaribari Masaba MP Ezekiel Machogu, youthful Charles Matoke, CAS Chris Obure, former South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya, Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka among others. Senator Ongeri’s ODM party has fielded Malack Matara in the Kiamokama ward by-election.Ongeri is keen to take over from Ongwae but since he hails from Nyaribari Masaba constituency, he faces a herculean task of delivering the seat to his party.Nyaribari Masaba MP Machogu who is also eyeing the governor seat has not declared his candidacy in the mini poll.Ongeri, Manduku and Machogu all hail from Nyaribari Masaba constituency and are bracing for bruising campaigns.The aspirant whose candidate wins in the by-election will likely have an edge over his opponents.Another 2022 governor candidate Manson Nyamweya has fielded Dominic Ateng'a through the Kenya National Congress.Nyamweya a former South Mugiurango MP is the party leader. He traversed the ward with his youthful candidate asking the people of Kiamokama to elect him as MCA.“The people of Kiamokama have a chance to elect a youthful person. Youths have been denied opportunities in counties and national government. We fielded a youth to demonstrate our willingness to work with youths in 2022,” said Nyamweya.Divisions are said to have rocked Deputy President William Ruto’s  Tangatanga camp after various splinter groups decided to field about four candidates.Former Constitutional Implementation Commission chair Charles Nyachae and Manduku who are allies of Ruto have also thrown his weight on Ondabu.Nyachae is the latest of the Kisii politicians to join Tangatanga.United Development Party affiliated to DP Ruto is fielding former Kiamokama Tea Factory director Nyandusi Nyakeramba.He is being backed by South Mugirango MP Silvanus Osoro and Nyaribari Chache politician Zaheer Jhanda while Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi has distanced himself from the candidate.On Wednesday, Nyakeramba declared that he is the only Tangatanga candidate. “I’m the only candidate allied to DP William Ruto. Anybody claiming to be pro-Tangatanga is a masquerader,” added Nyakeramba.Stephen Nyakeriga of TND who came second in the last election, however, distanced himself from Tangatanga.“I’m not pro any alliance. I want votes from all the people of Kiamokama who I want to represent in the assembly,” he added.The electoral agency, IEBC, cleared 11 candidates for the hotly contested by-elections after some of the aspirants who picked nomination papers withdrew from the race and supported Ondabu who is a former District Commissioner.IEBC Returning Officer Mark Manco urged for peaceful campaigns as he cleared the final batch of the on Tuesday at the Masimba Social Hall.Masimba town was a hive of activity as candidates raced against time to file their papers with the electoral body.And speaking to journalists various party bosses also called for peace to prevail as campaigns begin in earnest."

273,Are you under surveillance? Why people are fleeing WhatsApp,"Concerns emerged over the New Year when popular messaging app WhatsApp announced changes to its privacy policy. Social media was suddenly plagued with alarmist warnings that the changes would be bad for WhatsApp users.Though WhatsApp clarified that the changes to its privacy policy would not expose users' private information to surveillance, the developments raise questions over how much of our data is in the hands of foreign commercial entities, collectively referred to as Big Tech companies. These include Amazon, Apple, Facebook (which owns WhatsApp), Google, Microsoft and Twitter.So much was the hue and cry over WhatsApp that alternative messaging apps, such as Telegram and Signal, experienced a surge in new users this January. Celebrity entrepreneur Elon Musk publicly endorsed Signal.For all the furore about privacy, what are the odds that the average person will ever be targeted for surveillance? ""We are all being watched,"" says Gray Kassich, a Nairobi-based ICT expert. ""We are monitored by law enforcement agencies, advertisers through social media, researchers, as well as malicious persons (such as hackers) intending to steal from their victims,” he says.According to Kassich, the average person is not likely to be targeted by foreign intelligence agencies unless he or she is the subject of investigation. However, everybody inadvertently gets caught up in mass surveillance, mostly from security cameras installed along roads, in buildings, supermarkets, banking halls and even in public transport.Of concern is what the big tech companies do with the massive amount of personal data they have accumulated. Big tech companies say they neither read your messages nor listen to your calls. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an NGO active in digital privacy rights, explains how small snippets of data provides insights into individuals.Imagine getting an email from an HIV testing service. You call a doctor, then visit the website of an HIV support group, all within the same hour. The tech company does not know what was in the email or what you discussed with your doctor during your phone call, but the sequence of events can easily lead to a conclusion regarding your health status.As we cannot completely cut ourselves off from the digital world, we all have to find a way of staying safe online. “Never share personal information with any website that requests it,” Kassich says. “When signing up for social media and websites, use a different email account instead of your main one.”Other tips he offers:Never conduct banking activities on free Wi-Fi or any other Internet access point you don’t control.Avoid sharing information with strangers.Avoid installing apps from unofficial sources.Pay attention to any sudden change in your devices and computers. A drop in performance or strange software/apps should be investigated.Remove apps you don’t use as they are a security risk.Stay updated with information regarding your devices and apps. Implement any advisories you get from the manufacturers.“Online or offline, the fewer people you share a secret with, the better chance you have of keeping it private,” says the Electronic Frontier Foundation.Edited by T Jalio"
274,MPs want action against leaders behind Northeastern violence,"Three MPs and professionals from Northeastern want leaders who incite communities in the region held accountable.They asked the national government to put in place measures to prevent further influx of aliens from Ethiopia through Moyale and Magado-Elle Dimtu border.MPs Ahmed Kolosh (Wajir West), Mohammed Hire (Lagdera) and Musa Musa Arbele said in Nairobi on Monday that some leaders have been going to neighbouring counties to incite people and cause hatred among communities.“These tribal chiefs, including MPs, are hereby informed that their actions are more detrimental for their people,” Kolosh said.He regretted that politicians from Isiolo and Marsabit counties have been uttering inflammatory statements, inciting their people against other communities.“This happens while failing to appreciate that these counties are cosmopolitan and that no single community enjoys exclusive numerical advantage. Their actions have set these counties on war mood, disturbing the prevailing peace,” he added.Hire claimed the leaders have been using rebel groups from neighbouring Ethiopia to cause mayhem in the region.“The government should arrest leaders bankrolling these groups or else peace in the region will remain elusive,” Hire added.The call comes a day after Interior CS Fred Matiang'i warned that he will invoke the Public Order Act in parts of Isiolo, Garissa and Wajir counties if violence continues.The CS announced that the government will embark on a disarmament programme in the three counties to recover illegal guns held by civilians.He spoke on Tuesday after meeting political leaders from Isiolo, Wajir and Garissa over recent violence that has left at least eight people dead.Arbele said the groups causing problems have been banned in Ethiopia and are now being used by some leaders to cause mayhem in Wajir, Mandera, Garissa and Samburu counties.“This is a matter that needs to be dealt with decisively by government for peace and harmony to prevail,” he added.The MPs made the remarks at a press conference in Nairobi on Monday. Clan elders from North Eastern region also accompanied them.They wondered why the name of National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani was being dragged into the matter.Edited by Henry Makori"
275,Magoha lauds schools for keeping virus at bay,"Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has lauded efforts by schools to stem the spread of Covid-19, leading to a decline in infections three weeks after reopening.Magoha praised joint efforts by various stakeholders, although no data has been provided to support the claim.“I want to thank all stakeholders that we are now going into the third week of reopening and there is no surge of Covid-19, instead it is actually going down,” Magoha said.The CS spoke at Our Lady of Fatima Girls Secondary School in Nairobi where he met a group of security and education administrators.He said that 99 per cent of learners had reported back to schools since the reopening.That means of the 15 million learners in primary and secondary schools at least 150,000 are yet to report back.He banned the use of small-bottled hand sanitiser by students in schools.The CS on Wednesday raised the red flag over malicious use of the product to cause arson in learning institutions.The ban comes after an inferno razed part of a dormitory at Cheborge Boys Secondary School in Kericho. The cause of the fire was suspected to be an arson.“A fire was started using a sanitiser in one of the schools… I want to tell teachers that they must not allow small-bottled sanitisers into schools,” Magoha said.Magoha also announced that the government is in plans to restart the provision of sanitary pads to school girls with attention focussed on adolescents in primary schools.“Every child in primary school will be given a nine months' package of sanitary towels,” Magoha said.It is not clear when the items will be distributed to secondary schools.Magoha also raised an alarm over absenteeism in arid and semi-arid areas due to lack of food. He said the government will revive the school feeding programme to address this.No child shall be sent home for school fees, he said. “Soon the next tranche of money will be made available for capitation, once it is available,” Magoha said.Magoha has blamed parents over the increased student attacks on teachers terming them as negligent.He called upon law enforcement agencies to take stern action on the perpetrators as he asked teachers to take care of themselves.Edited by Henry Makori"
276,County workers' union seeks to block construction of Sh5bn tower,"A county workers union has moved to court to block the development of the Sh5 billion G47 Ugatuzi tower launched last December by the Council of Governors.Kenya County Government Workers Union says the project was undertaken without public participation, hence amounts to a violation of rights of its members.In their suit papers filed in Milimani court under a certificate of urgency, the union says public interest favours conserving the pension of workers from wastage and investment that violates the Constitution.“It will be against public interest if retirees cannot access their pension due to the illegal investment in Ugatuzi Tower,” it said.The court heard that the best time to address the legality of the project is at the commencement stage.“Unless the matter is certified urgent and dealt with expeditiously, the first respondent will commit the over Sh5 billion, which is way over the authorised annual spending, hence putting workers’ fund in imminent danger of misuse.”According to the union, county governments have huge bills of outstanding amounts unremitted to two pension schemes.“The county staffs have always been at risk of retiring without any savings.”The union now wants the court to issue orders stopping Laptrust and County Pension Fund from using resources and carrying out the construction of the tower.It has sued the Board of Trustees Local Authority Pension Trust, the County Pension Fund, County Pension Fund Financial Services Limited, Retirement Benefits Authority and the CoG.Laptrust was established under local government rules, 2007, as an umbrella retirement benefits scheme for all local authorities. Its principal objective is to provide pension and other retirement benefits to employees of the sponsors upon their retirement from service."
277,Religious leaders volunteer to arbitrate in health sector dispute,"Failure by the national and county governments to speak in one voice has been blamed for the prolonged strike in the health sector.With the health unions now seeking the help of the Central Organisation of Trade Union and the Inter-Religious Council to get a lasting solution to the strike that has been ongoing for the past 45 days, the two levels of government have only been huffing and puffing.Despite a return-to-work agreement having been arrived at more than two weeks ago in a meeting initiated between the ministries of Labour and Health, counties have come out with a contrary opinion.A meeting scheduled between the two levels of government last Monday to hasten the signing of the agreement failed to take place, with Health CS Mutahi Kagwe now leaving the matter to the counties to solve.“There is no confusion; workers who work for the county governments will deal with county governments in terms of their welfare, insurance and working environment,” he said.Kagwe has maintained that as a parent ministry, they agreed to be arbitrators and to engage both county governments and health workers to bring out a harmonious working relationship but have no intention of taking roles of county governments.“We continue from a policy and philosophy point of view to urge that the counties engage and agree on various working protocols with the healthcare worker; but as I said, we will not interfere and cannot in law go and tell a county government whether to hire or fire any of its healthcare workers,” he maintained.But the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (Supkem), in a letter to the chairman of the Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee, has expressed concern about the disruptions experienced in the health sector, especially at this time of the Covid-19 pandemic.The letter by acting national chairman Hassan ole Naado has been copied to the Head of Public Service, the CSs for National Treasury and Labour, the CoG chair, Cotu secretary-general, KUCO secretary-general and the executive director of the Inter-Religious Council of Kenya.“Our view is that the national and county governments are not pulling in the same direction on this very critical issue. We are of this view because we are treated to conflicting reports—that the matter has been resolved and an RTWF being agreed upon, only to hear the CoG holding a contrary opinion,” Naado said.The CoG has come out claiming the counties were not consulted, adding that they have no budgetary allocation to implement the agreement.“Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health appears to have opted out of the issue, leaving it to the counties to resolve. The Treasury, for its part, issues reports that indicate that we are in a tight economic condition,” Naado said.He is of the opinion that the difference between the two levels of government is causing untold suffering to the public and the health workers, yet all these institutions are supposed to look after the welfare of citizens.Naado said the resolution of the matter requires a multi-agency approach as an extreme priority as it is quickly turning into a national disaster.“In looking at this issue, national interest should be topmost. If we have a financial crunch as repeatedly indicated by the Treasury, then it is time a national conversation is held so we can all rally together and pull out of this crisis,” he said.""But doing so will also mean facing up to some difficult questions because belt-tightening has to be felt in every sphere of the public management and the sore point will include the issue of expenditure on the BBI and the soaring public debt triggered by expenditure on infrastructure projects.”The nurses and clinical officers say they are ready to accord Cotu and inter-religious teams all the support they need to ensure a lasting solution to the stalemate.“As a union, we want to assure Cotu SG Francis Atwoli that we shall cooperate with him if there is any information he wants from our union so he can use it to bring parties together. As a union, we are ready to meet the Council of Governors any time,” KNUN secretary general Seth Panyako said.National Nurses Association of Kenya president Alfred Obengo said the goal shifts between the national and county governments, who are custodians of employment, on the subject of resolving the ongoing strike is disheartening."
278,Trader who shot Ronalo eatery boss apologises for courtroom insult,"The trial of a city businessman charged with the attempted murder of Ranalo Foods restaurant owner William Osewe in 2016 was on Wednesday adjourned to February.Suspect Tom Mboya’s witnesses failed to appear in court as one of them had a medical emergency.Mboya is defending himself in the case and has four witnesses to testify in his favour.Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku summoned the witnesses to appear in court on February 5.On Tuesday, Mboya was released from custody after he apologised in court, adding that he didn't mean what he was saying when he insulted Osewe.“Your honour, I apologise for using vulgar language as I did not mean it. I wanted to mean he was behaving in a beastly way,” Mboya told magistrate Mutuku in court.On Monday morning the accused was remanded for one day after he referred to Osewe as an animal.The court had warned the accused to refrain from using such language but he did not listen.""Mboya has used bad language that has violated the dignity of this court despite warning him severally. I cannot allow a person to refer to another human being as an animal. I remand you until tomorrow morning so that you can rethink about the language to be used in court and also your conduct as we proceed with this case,"" the magistrate said. In his earlier defence, Mboya confirmed to the court that he fired two shots in the air and another at Osewe's right hand which was holding his firearm to scare him. He has further confirmed that after shooting him he did not help him but rushed to Kasarani police station to report the incident. Mboya said before the shooting as he was leaving Hagon hotel off Thika Road for lunch, he saw Osewe storm out of his car shouting, ""Umelala na bibi yangu sana lakini leo nimekupata (You have slept with my wife many times, but I've caught you this time).""At the same time the court advised his lawyer to caution his client to stop using bad language when in court and should always respect the court.Another incident where the court witnessed disrespect was when Mboya picked a sweet from his pocket and started chewing without seeking the court's permission.In September 2019 when Mboya was put on his defence, he told the court that Osewe had threatened to chop off his manhood and kill him if he didn’t stop sleeping with his wife.Mboya had admitted to shooting Osewe in self-defence. He told Mutuku that he aimed his gun at Osewe’s hands because he wanted to disarm him.The hearing continues on February 5."
279,Private valuers introduced to enhance service delivery — Karoney,"Private valuers have been empowered to enhance service delivery, Lands CS Farida Karoney has said. In a statement on Wednesday, Karoney said the move was meant to enhance efficiency and reduce the turnaround time for the return of valuation figures.“This is also meant to boost government revenue due to the wide reach of private valuers,” she said.Valuation of land in Kenya for purposes of calculating Stamp Duty payable has been a preserve of the Chief government valuer.The CS said the intensive titling programme by the government has seen a rise in land dealings, especially in the counties.“This increase has put a strain on personnel in the office of the Chief Government Valuer, causing inordinate delays and loss of revenue in some cases‚” Karoney said.She said the introduction of valuations by private valuers through the amendment of Section 10A of the Stamp Duty Act, Cap 480 provides an opportunity to enhance efficiency.Karoney said the move will also remedy the unfavourable business environment in this section of the land transaction process.She said the modalities for the appointment of private valuers by the Chief Government Valuer were developed through consultations between the Treasury and National Planning, the Ministry of Lands, and key stakeholders in the sector.The outcome was the publication of the Stamp Duty Valuation of Immovable Property Regulations 2020 on August 5, 2020.The regulations spell out the procedure for appointing private valuers, service level agreements between the Ministry of Lands regarding professionalism, timeliness, and fees payable by transferees for valuation.In line with the above regulations, 255 practising private valuers applied for appointment after advertisement by the Chief Government Valuer calling for applications.“The vetting process is complete and a list of successful applicants shall be available on the Ministry’s website by Friday, January 22, 2021,” she said.Karoney said the introduction of private valuers affords citizens and particularly property owners the right of choice.She said citizens are however encouraged to understand the provisions of the law to enable their informed decision-making.Karoney said the revised requisition for valuation for stamp duty form is downloadable and the list of accredited private valuers is accessible on the Ministry’s website.“The Ministry shall pursue continuous stakeholder engagements to address any issues of concern,” she said.Karoney clarified that the Government does not charge any fees for the valuation of stamp duty.However, those who elect private valuers will incur valuation costs as provided in the Valuers Act.She said the appointed valuers will be expected to observe professionalism in the conduct of their duties.Karoney said the Ministry is committed to efficient, accountable, and transparent service delivery.The CS said the move is part of the government's aggressive multi-sectoral business re-engineering process to stimulate the business environment in the country and improve the Nation’s doing business ranking.These programs include the ongoing digitalisation of land records and eventual migration to the National Land Information System for conducting land transactions, review of policies and legislation amongst others.The Stamp Duty Act is one of the statutes that was reviewed.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
280,"Cops strangle, torture suspects to death to evade Ipoa — lobby","Are rogue police officers ditching guns for extrajudicial killings of criminal suspects and going for strangulation, bludgeoning and other means of elimination?That's what Haki Africa executive director Hussein Khalid says he is coming to believe and where the evidence is pointing.Police spokesman Charles Owino declined comment.An officer at Pangani police station told the Star police had been trailing two suspects - Ramadhan Bakari and Jamal Maina- for crimes in Eastleigh and Mathare. Concerns are mounting over rising cases of abduction and killing of suspected criminals in Nairobi, with lobby groups fearing police could be using torture and strangulation.Ramadhan Bakari and Jamal Maina were allegedly arrested by plain-clothes officers in Nairobi in December and January, respectively. Their bodies were discovered at City Mortuary after a prolonged search by their families.Bakari, 17, was a Form 2 student at Balozi High School. Lobby groups following his case say that he was arrested on December 10 at 4pm at Eastleigh near Mlango Kubwa area by plain-clothes officers.The officers are said to be known to locals.He was not arrested alone. He was with a friend who was released after his family followed up.Bakaris’ family did not get the information on time, so he remained in custody. When they later followed up at Pangani police station, the officers denied ever arresting someone of Bakari’s description, prompting a frantic search.From Kamukunji, Muthaiga to Central police stations, the family got nothing. A visit to the morgue later in the month confirmed their fears.A contact of a family friend who works at the mortuary told them to check after seeing Bakari's story on television, including his picture.Bakari’s body bore clear bruises. A postmortem examination conducted on December 29 found that he was strangled to death.His body also bore signs of torture, with injury marks on the head, arms and legs. Blunt trauma caused bleeding in the brain.Jamal Maina was also picked at 4pm at Shauri Moyo on Friday, January 15 and was bundled into the boot of a white Toyota Probox saloon car. He was a matatu driver.The following day, his family found his body at the city mortuary and records at the facility show it was taken there by police officers who said they collected it on the banks of the Nairobi River.A postmortem examination on Tuesday showed that the body bore signs of strangulation, torture marks, bruises and blunt trauma to the head.Khalid who has been working with the two families to follow the cases told the Star that he suspected the police was ditching shooting of suspects as a way of evading accountability.""It is easy to trace back the bullets to the officer who fired it. Now they are going for tortures and strangulation to clean their tracks and evade being held accountable,"" he said.Maina was buried on Tuesday at Kariokor cemetery.In both cases, he said, witnesses claimed to recognise the officers.""The officers are well known by locals. This is impunity and extrajudicial killings must come to a stop,"" Khalid said.(Edited  by V. Graham)"
281,Audit firm wants case of former CEO taken to arbitration,"An audit firm has asked the court to refer a dispute involving its former employee to arbitration.Ernst & Young had been sued by former chief executive officer Gitahi Gachahi over exit earnings.But the audit firm, in its reply to the case, says the former CEO was not an employee but a partner. The firm and the former boss had an agreement hence the need for arbitration, the court was told.Also sought by the audit firm is an order for dismissal of the case because the Labour court where it was lodged does not have jurisdiction to handle it.But Gachahi’s lawyer asked for more time to respond to the application. Justice Nduma Nderi gave him up to March 15 when the case will be argued.Gachahi had accused the firm of failing to act in good faith when it made variations to his earnings without any engagement. “The percentage variation of 22.5 per cent was discriminatory and biased as no other partner earnings were varied by more than 5 peer cent despite Covid-19,” he said.He said the controversial decision to change the accounting policy to increase depreciation targeted him to reduce his earnings by Sh10 million.According to his suit papers his retirement package was slashed by Sh10 million after the firm capped his leave days at 60 as opposed to 153.Also, some Sh2.8 million was reduced from his pay as part of austerity measures to cushion the firm against Covid-19 effects.Gachahi was the CEO of the audit and advisory firm from October 2009 until June 30, 2020 when he retired.His efforts to have the firm review its decision in terms of his retirement package did not bear fruit, forcing him to seek redress from the courts.He now wants court to stop the firm from distributing its 2020 income among its partners pending hearing and determination of his case."
282,Savula meets Wangwe in push to impeach DP Ruto,"ANC is is consolidating support in the National Assembly to impeach Deputy President William Ruto.Deputy party leader Ayub Savula on Tuesday evening met Majority Whip Emmanuel Wangwe to seek support in removing the DP, whom they accuse of undermining President Uhuru Kenyatta.Savula is also planning to meet National Assembly Minority Whip Junet Mohamed.“Jubilee whipped members during the removal of Majority leader Aden Duale and Majority Whip Ben Washiali last year. We are hoping those numbers are still intact because we need them to remove Ruto,” Savula told the Star.When contacted, Wangwe said he met Savula but was quick to point out the Jubilee Party had not taken a position on the matter.“I met him but that does not mean I support that agenda. Let ANC bring the motion to Parliament first, then we can talk about whether I should whip members to support it or not,” he said.He added that it was within Savula's right to move an impeachment motion in the House.“Once the motion is in the House, then we can have the discussion. At the moment, my focus is the Building Bridges Initiative,” he said.Wangwe further said leaders should focus on addressing issues affecting the common man.“We should not take too much time on one person. As for now, my focus is reforms through the BBI. This is what we should be telling Kenyans about,” he stated.Savula maintained, however, that Ruto needed to be removed because he had become an impediment to the President's development agenda.“I am sure of getting the numbers. If I get about 120 from Jubilee and then some more coalition members in Nasa, then it will be as good as done,” he said.ANC has only 14 MPs in the National Assembly. An MP requires to be supported by at least a third of all the members (117) to move a motion for the impeachment of the Deputy President.At least two-thirds of the members - 233 of the 349 – are needed to approve the motion.If approved, the motion will be introduced in the Senate, which will conduct a trial to ascertain the charges.Two-thirds of the senators -45 of the 67- are needed to send the Deputy President home. ANC has three senators.Speaking on Kameme FM on Wednesday morning, ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi said it was within the rights of his MPs to move an impeachment motion.“I asked them why they wanted to do it and they gave me their reasons. They are well within their rights,” he added.He said having fewer MPs in the House does not mean the motion will fail.Mudavadi added that it was wrong for Ruto to appear to be absolving himself from the failures of the government he leads.“You cannot oppose the government you are in and call yourself an assistant to the head of state. There is something called collective responsibility,” he stated.Mudavadi further said Ruto should quit government if he feels he does not agree with the agenda of his boss.“The late Jaramogi Oginga resigned when he disagreed with Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. The late Joseph Murumbi also resigned,” he explained.ANC MPs have asked Ruto to resign or face impeachment for allegedly undermining Uhuru. Ruto says he is the one who is being undermined, not the other way around. (Edited by V. Graham)"
283,"Murang’a team to pursue Kakuzi, community cohesion","Murang’a county security team has formed a committee to enhance harmony between the fruits processor Kakuzi and the community.The committee will also spearhead the process of acquiring title deeds by primary schools that are within the company’s land.Speaking on Tuesday during the donation of desks by Kakuzi to Gatitu and Gathungururu secondary school, county commissioner Mohamed Barre said once the title deeds are processed, there will be reduced conflicts.This comes months after the company was suspended by major retail outlets in the United Kingdom over allegations of human rights violations.This happened after Leigh Day law firm announced that it had initiated legal action against Kakuzi’s parent company, Camellia.The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 79 Kenyans including Kakuzi employees at London's High Court and accused the company’s security guards of perpetrating the crimes since 2009, including killings, rape, attacks and false imprisonment.Kakuzi, however, said it is a responsible corporate citizen who strives to live up to its values and commitments and apologised for the atrocities reported by the community.Barre said the firm’s contributions to the local economy are immense but highlighted the need for its issues with locals to be solved.He said over 4,498 people have been employed by the company that also works with 1,300 out growers who sell their fruits to the company and earn a living.“Those who are trying to bring down the company, where will they take all these people who depend on it?” Barre asked.The commissioner cited the many schools established within the company’s land and which the firm supports.The firm also donated 100 acres of land for the establishment of Murang’a Teachers Training College that has been instrumental in the education sector.Among other donations made by the firm were, 275 desks and 3,600 packets of sanitary towels to nearby schools, 28 handwashing points in neighbouring towns replenished with 14,000 litres of water and soap daily, three ICU beds, six patient monitors, six syringe pumps, 10,000 surgeon caps and 10 modern mist blowers to sanitize towns.The firm’s assistant general manager for corporate affairs Wilson Odiyo said the firm is ready to address the grievances reported by the members of the community.In October last year, some locals narrated horrific accounts of harassment by the guards and wanted to be enjoined in the case against the firm’s parent company in London high court.Some said they had been maimed and forced to be dependent on their families while others decried sexual harassment.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
284,"Children need 1.5m friendly masks, say governors","Governors say they need at least 1.5 million “child-friendly” masks to distribute in nursery schools across the country.Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga, who heads the Council of Governors Education committee, said masks currently in the market are not suitable for children as they are produced for adults.“We must produce 1.5 million child-friendly face masks for kids in our early childhood education (ECDE) centres,” he said on Tuesday at a forum convened by the Kenya Editors Guild and Unicef.A child-friendly mask should be made from cloth and fit the face well to help prevent them from fidgeting with it.However, the advice on children and face masks is varied.In August last year, the World Health Organization and Unicef advised against masks for children aged five years and under.“This is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance,” WHO said.ECDE centres in Kenya admit children aged five years and below. WHO and Unicef said even those aged between six and 11 years should wear masks only if there is widespread transmission in the community and the child is able to safely and appropriately use a mask.The two organisations only advise masks for children aged 12 and above.However, the US Centres for Diseases Control advises that children over the age of two years should wear masks in public, or in situations where physical distancing is difficult.“We have 15,000 ECDE centres countrywide, and we have a big problem with physical distancing,” Kahiga said.Maniza Zaman, Unicef Representative in Kenya, said children are not the main drivers of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Evidence shows that children – especially those under 10 – are less susceptible to Covid-19 and less likely to transmit it than adults,” she said.Zaman was the keynote speaker at the meeting.She said children are safer in school than at home where they mix with the community, and it is difficult to ensure handwashing, wearing of masks for older children and social distancing are followed.Zaman advised handwashing and distancing might offer the best protection for young children under 10 years.“To support the safe reopening of schools, Unicef has distributed soap and installed handwashing facilities in more than 600 schools across Kenya and procured 700,000 reusable masks for children,” she said.School closures last year interrupted learning for over 17 million children in Kenya, who missed between six and nine months of formal education. The Unicef boss said they are supporting the government to ensure all children return to school safely.“We’ve designed a range of materials, including posters, radio adverts and videos, where religious leaders and other respected figures speak directly to parents about the importance of bringing their children back to school,” Maniza said."
285,Six bodies recovered as hunt for bandits heightened in Baringo,"Police yesterday retrieved six bullet-riddled bodies in a bush in Arabal, Baringo South, amid an operation to flush out armed bandits in Kapedo.Rift Valley regional coordinator Goerge Natembeya said that one of the bodies belonged to a suspected bandit. The dead man had on a striped sheet and a necklace. The other five are yet to be identified.“He was among the bandits behind a raid that took place in Arabal village, Baringo South, on Tuesday evening. He was shot and died on the spot,” Natembeya said. Some 22 head of cattle were stolen during the attack.He said there was a fierce exchange of fire between the bandits and the officers.“That is all I can say but if there were some other civilians who were caught up in the battle, then I don’t know,” he said.Natembeya said the operation will continue until the dangerous bandits are disarmed and got rid of. “Our innocent and peaceful people should remain calm as the officers do their job,” he said.The bodies were moved to Baringo County Referral Hospital mortuary in Kabarnet town. The families or the communities of the dead persons are unknown.Security officers have intensified operations in Kapedo, border of Baringo and Turkana, to apprehend those behind the killing of senior GSU officer Emadau Tamkol. He was ambushed and shot dead by gunmen on Sunday."
286,Court orders return of Kiambu teachers' company properties,"It was a sigh of relief for over 5,000 shareholders of Murutani Company in Kiambu county after their grabbed properties were reverted to them by a court.The shareholders, who are teachers, started the company in 1983 and bought two plots within Kiambu town where they built commercial premises.“Since 1990, different boards of directors have run the affairs of the company from time to time,” chairman Anthony Kamuna said.In 2008 the shareholders resolved that the assets be sold and the company dissolved. But this did not happen.New elections were held in 2010 and Kamuna became the chairman. The board embarked on selling the properties through a firm that turned out to be corrupt, he said.Njuakim commercial agencies had drawn two sale agreements of Block 1/57 in 2009 of Sh7.5 million and property transferred to the agency and was issued with a forged Murutani receipt of Sh3.2 million without depositing any money in Murutani accounts.The second sale agreement attracted a price of Sh4.6 million. The Kenya National Union of Teachers noted the unfolding events and conducted a valuation of the property and found it to be worth Sh10 million in 2009.The then company secretary and Njuakim agent were arrested and  found guilty of fraud and forgery.In block 11/87 the company property a valuation was done in 2009 and was valued at Sh65 million but again Njuakim agencies was to sell the property at a throw away price of Sh40 million.The current company secretary Charles Munyua said the company is progressing in regaining the shareholders' properties."
287,State alert after two cases of Covid variant picked by Kemri teams,"The government has heightened surveillance after two cases of the Covid-19 variant were picked by the KEMRI teams.The two people have since been returned to their country.Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has however defended the decision not to suspend flights despite the threat of the new variants saying experts in the country with a better understanding advised that the country keeps watching until we are sure the variant being talked about has got a negative impact on the people.“I do know is that the issues of variants and changing and mutating of viruses is normal and it happens all the time continuously. Variants come some can grow stronger but usually they grow weaker,” Kagwe said during the daily update on Wednesday.This comes even as the country recorded 136 new cases from a sample size of 3,787 tested in 24 hours.This raises the caseload in the country to 99,444 from cumulative tests of 1,134,494 tested to date.The new cases all Kenyans except 19 who were foreign nationals.Two more patients succumbed to the virus raising the fatalities to 1,736. On a positive note, 176 more patients recovered from the virus, 162 from the home based care programme and 14  were discharged from various health facilities countrywide, bringing the recoveries to 82,654.“Viruses or other pathogens will always continue to mutate in order to continue surviving. In deed we have reported two cases. We all know that this variant is 50 per cent more transmissible therefore posing a significant risk in that more people will be infected and therefore could be able to stretch the healthcare system more,” Ag DG Patrick Amoth said.According to the DG, the two cases were men who were not exhibiting any symptoms.“This was picked because of heightened surveillance system, and at the point of picking them they were all asymptomatic,” Amoth said.However, scientific evidence has shown that even though the variant is more transmissible it is not as strong as the normal Covid-19 and can also still be picked by the routine PCR.“And evidence emerging today form the US is that the vaccines could be effective against this virus especially the Pfizer vaccine.”Currently, there are 686 patients admitted in various health facilities while 1,625 were on the home based care and programme.Kagwe also confirmed that 30 patients were in the ICU, 14 of whom were on ventilator support and 14 on supplemental oxygen. Two more were under observation. Another 11 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen with 10 of them being in the general wards and one in the high dependency unit."
288,Lady Gaga stuns as she performs US national anthem during inaugural ceremony,"As the world focuses on the swearing in of the 46th President of the United States of America, Joe Biden, Lady Gaga took the stage and left millions with chills as she performed the American national anthem.This happened during the inauguration ceremony of  the next president of US, Joe Biden She was dressed in a black and red ball gown which she paired with an oversized bird brooch, leather gloves, and a beautiful yet simple braided hairstyle.The celebrated artiste was lucky enough to be chosen to perform the national anthem and as we all know, Gaga has a really powerful voice and her message was well received during the much awaited ceremony.Gaga had previously tweeted how excited she was to perform during the inauguration ceremony.""I am deeply honored to be joining @BidenInaugural on January 20 to sing the National Anthem and celebrate the historic inauguration of @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris!""Jennifer Lopez was also a guest star at the inaugural ceremony where she gave nothing but a breathtaking performance.Dressed in a white ensemble, Jennifer was not about to play around fashion wise, but performance wise, she really did give her all and was escorted off stage with a round of applause.Republican President Donald Trump left Washington on Wednesday ahead of Joe Biden's swearing in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, with the Democrat assuming the helm of a country beset by deep political divides and battered by a raging coronavirus pandemic.Biden, 78, will become the oldest U.S. president in history at a scaled-back ceremony in Washington that has been largely stripped of its usual pomp and circumstance, due both to the coronavirus as well as security concerns following the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters."

290,Poll experts rap IEBC over slow BBI signatures review,"Poll experts have raised concerns of the slow pace with which the IEBC is verifying the 4.2 million signatures backing the BBI bill.The Elections Observation Group (Elog) castigated the commission citing its consistent failure to meet their daily target of 550 records per day.Taking cue from the IEBC January 8 update, the election observation group said the 544,624 records captured by then translated to a daily work rate of 340 records, 210 records below the daily target.“The Commission should provide a more attainable and realistic target in case the initial target of 550 daily is not achievable,” Elog said in a statement.Chairperson National Steering Committee Regina Opondo and National Coordinator Mulle Musau said that setting realistic targets will provide the stakeholders enough time to readjust their expectations.“It helps in addressing suspicion and fears that come with delays in the process of verification,” the Elog bosses said.They asked the commission “to hasten the process of verification to avert any speculation that would continue to spark political reactions.”The team is also alarmed by the intermittent breakdown in internet connectivity at the Bomas of Kenya which is housing the 400 clerks conducting the verification.Elog equally has an issue with the IEBC's messaging citing the ‘Burning Bridges’ tweet, and the wrong date in the commission's January 8 update.Saying the errors do not augur well with the public and other stakeholders, Elog implored the commission ""to exercise accuracy and due diligence in all its public communication.""On the internet connectivity issue, the observers asked the IEBC to keep in place measures that ensures that data capture and verification processes go on uninterrupted.BBI secretariat co-chairman Junet Mohamed recently raised the concerns of IEBC’s pace of work accusing the electoral body of sabotaging the BBI.The secretariat said they would be uncomfortable if the IEBC doesn’t conclude the process by January 31, barely 10 day away. They threatened public protests against the commission.ODM chairman John Mbadi said the commission was taking unnecessarily long to conclude the signature verification.IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati dismissed the assertions saying they were up to the task and would deliver the signatures in no time.He assured all stakeholders and the general public that the IEBC was committed to ensuring the verification is carried out in a transparent and accountable manner.The commission earlier attributed the intermittent internet connectivity challenges to system upgrade of the bandwidth and power outages. Chebukati said the issue was formally brought to the attention of Bomas of Kenya management for quick action and the same addressed.Elog however holds that IEBC stands to do better further pointing out the sorry state of the room where the clerks are conducting the verification.They observed that the venue lacks proper ventilation with windows situated very high above the hall of operation.“Further, the space that houses the 400 clerks with their supervisors is also very constrained hence not possible to observe the 1-meter spacing as recommended under the Covid 19 protocols.”“The commission should consider expanding the space by providing open-air tents within the premises,” Elog said.They urged data clerks, Commission staff and observers to continually exercise caution and follow the laid down COVID 19 protocols at all times."
291,"De-escalate security operation in Kapedo, leaders tell Uhuru","Leaders from Baringo and West Pokot counties have appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to de-escalate the ongoing security operation in the volatile Kapedo area.Led by Senate Majority leader Samuel Poghisio and Tiaty MP William Kamket, they faulted the government for the “inhumane” operation and called for restraint from security agencies.“We want to appeal to the President to de-escalate the operations. The situation is so bad and dire in Kapedo and the surrounding areas,” Kamket said during a press conference at Parliament Buildings.Security agencies have launched a massive crackdown in pursuit of bandits after a top GSU officer was shot dead allegedly by the lot. The leaders claimed a number of innocent people have been killed since the operation started at the weekend.They lamented that the government has turned a deaf ear to the underlying issues causing inter-community violence nearly every election year and resorted to using excessive force—torturing and maiming residents.“Is this government there to protect us or kill us? We cannot show might and pretend that we are solving a problem,” West Pokot assembly speaker Catherine Mukenyang said.They said it is high time the government changed tack in addressing the never-ending clashes between the Pokots, Turkanas and other communities in Kapedo and the larger Suguta Valley.According to them, the government should adopt dialogue between the warring communities, resolve the boundary dispute between Baringo and Turkana, spread security agents across Suguta, not just in Kapedo, and develop the poverty-stricken area.“The time has come for the government to stop securitising the problems in Kapedo and adopt a different approach… the chest-thumping won’t work. The show of might won’t work,” the leaders said in a joint press statement.“The government needs to realise it is dealing with people who believe they have been denied opportunities for the entire life of this nation and that they are on their own.”They said the government should resolve the boundary dispute on where Kapedo belongs, develop a massive economic marshal plan and invest in education and other social welfare programmes in the area.“In Kapedo, our people are fighting each other over poverty. We must address ourselves to the general under-development in the area.”Poghisio condemned the killing of residents and police officers in the area. He said the problem is deeply rooted and cannot be resolved by use of force.“The under-development in that area have left people wondering where Kenya is going. Every time we report about Kapedo, it is about negative things. The backwardness, underdevelopment and marginalisation of that area have left people wondering.”Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto said resolving intermittent conflicts in the area requires elaborate and all-inclusive dialogue and arbitrations of the communities and not excessive force.He added successive governments have been unable to resolve the problem by using force.“When Kibaki came, we launched a Dumisha Amani operation. He is the person who tried to manage the issue,” he said."
292,Magoha bans use of portable hand sanitisers by students,"Education CS Prof George Magoha has banned the use of portable sanitisers by students in schools.The CS on Wednesday raised a red flag over malicious use of the product to cause arson in learning institutions.This comes after an inferno razed part of a dormitory at Cheborge Boys Secondary School in Kericho; the cause of the fire was suspected to be an arson.“A fire was started using a sanitiser in one of the schools… I want to tell teachers that they must not allow small-bottle sanitisers into schools the portable sanitisers, with students should be taken and returned when the child is leaving school,” Magoha said.The CS was speaking at Our Lady of Fatima Girls Secondary School in Nairobi where he was meeting a group of security and education administrators.In the first week of January, Magoha stated that large quantities of sanitisers will not be allowed in schools, directing that only about five litres will be allowed and will be handled by teachers.The CS said the roll-out of the Government’s supply of desks is expected to benefit public primary and secondary schools with a total of 625,000 desks.He also praised MPs for using CDF funds to equip schools with water and sanitation facilities.Every child in primary school will be given a nine months package of sanitary towels.For secondary school, uncertainty of when the provision will be done still hangs as the CS notes talks on the acquisition and distribution is still ongoing with development partners.Magoha also raised an alarm over absenteeism in arid and semi-arid areas due to lack of food; he said the government will revive the school feeding programme to address this.No child shall be sent home for school fees, he reiterated.“Soon the next tranche of money will be made available for capitation,” Magoha said."

294,"Court suspends Nairobi governor by-election, again","Justice James Makau has yet again suspended the Nairobi governor by-election.However, in a new twist, judge Makau on Wednesday froze the IEBC's 60-day timeline to conduct elections.This means that IEBC will begin counting the 60 days after the case is concluded in court.The commission had scheduled the election for February 18 before the Gazette notice was suspended.Activist Okiya Omtatah had asked the court to grant him an order even though there are two other orders suspending the election.The earlier orders were issued by Justice Antony Mrima in two cases by impeached Governor Mike Sonko and the current acting Governor Anne Kananu.On Tuesday, Judge Mrima referred Omtatah's matter along with Sonko's case to Justice Makau to deal with the issue of empaneling a bench.However, Omtatah insisted that that the court gives him the order incase Sonko or Kananu withdraw their cases.In the case, Okiya Omtatah had moved to court early this year seeking to suspend the election.The judge consolidated both Omtatah and Sonko's case because they are related.He directed them to appear before him on Monday next week for hearing of the application to empanel a bench."

""We are challenging my continued illegal confinement by the Ugandan police and the military,"" Wine posted via Twitter on Wednesday.In the complaint, the lawyer said the opposition leader is being held without any criminal charges preferred against him.Wine was the main opposition candidate in the concluded Ugandan General.The singer-turned politician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, posted on his Twitter account that he was running out of basic commodities since he and his family are unable to move out of the house, which he said is surrounded by the military.“Day Six under house arrest and we're still stuck with an 18-month-old baby who had paid a visit to her auntie (my wife) before we were raided and besieged,” Wine said.Wine emerged second in the election, which was won by the incumbent Yoweri Museveni.According to the electoral commission, Museveni won 5.85 million votes, equal to 58.6 per cent, as Wine had 3.48 million votes, 34.8 per cent of the votes cast.Wine had claimed that the election was marred by irregularities in favour of the incumbent but he is yet to prove his claims."

297,Tatoo trouble: Kakamega mum in dilemma after school turns away son,"A parent is in a dilemma after her form three son was sent back home over a tattoo on his arm.Rosemary told the Star that she was shocked when the administration of a school in Kakamega county sent her son back on grounds that he will only be admitted when the tattoo is removed.According to her, when schools reopened, the 17-year-old reported to school as was expected and all was well.However, all hell broke loose when she visited the school a few days later to collect a bursary form.""When I arrived, I was told to see the principal. After some time, I was notified that I should go back home with my son because he had a tattoo and the school would not allow him to continue with classes,"" she said.""I tried to plead and negotiate on behalf of my boy, but all my plea fell on dead ears. I gave up and since then my son is just in the house,"" she added.Rosemary said she did not know the boy had tattooed himself until few days to school opening.""I realised he was hiding something. But when I insisted, he opened up and told me he had a tattoo on his upper arm. When I checked, it was a foot stamp with my name on it,"" she said.She said since the boy drew the tattoo without her knowledge, she has been seeking help but none seems to go through.""I have even tried the possibility of removing the tattoo but I have been warned that it is expensive with the risk of his arm becoming numb and swelling,"" Rosemary said.She said since she had paid part of the school fees, she hoped that her son would be subjected to some form of punishment but allowed to proceed with her studies.""He is so remorseful and regrets what he did. He has already spent more than 9 months at home and feel bad that he is losing so much,"" she said.""I am not sure how the Education ministry can help be but if there is a way they can intervene so that my son can be allowed in school I would be grateful,"" she added.The Star reached out to Barry Tusker, a tattoo expert who said police should track and arrest the artist who drew the said tattoo on the boy.Barry said the law prohibits tattooing anybody who is below 18 years.""That is inflicting pain on the minor. How did he do it without following the laid down procedures, if not then the parent should take the blame for negligence,"" Barry said.He said any minor seeking to have a tattoo on them should come along with their parent in-person to sign a consent form.Barry said the only available option is to either remove the tattoo or change its design using concealers though that would be a temporary remedy.""If it were to be removed, it will be done through laser surgery in sessions with each session costing between Sh4,000 and Sh12,000 depending of the price of the person doing it.""Barry said one cannot predict the number of sessions one will undergo because it depends on the size of the tattoo and the depth of the ink.His sentiments are echoed by Jake Kuria who said another option would be to fully shade the tattoo in that when it heals it looks like a birthmark.Kuria however regretted the fact that tattoos are associated with criminality yet it is just some form of art expressed on the body.""Anyone can become a criminal because everyone has their beliefs. You cannot link tattoos with criminality and a child should not be denied the right to education because of a tattoo,"" Kuria said.To him, if the school feels aggrieved, they should have just punished the boy as a warning to others and let him be.""If all schools were to crackdown on tattoos, you will be surprised on the number of students even pupils who will be sent back home, let there be an appropriate way to handle the matter,"" he said.According to Mayo clinic, those seeking to be tattooed should not take the risks lightly.They must fully understand basic safety precautions and aftercare.How tattoos are doneA tattoo is a permanent mark or design made on your skin with pigments inserted through pricks into the skin's top layer.Mayo clinic states that typically, the tattoo artist uses a hand-held machine that acts much like a sewing machine, with one or more needles piercing the skin repeatedly.With every puncture, the needles insert tiny ink droplets in the body.The process which is done without anesthetics causes a small amount of bleeding and slight to potentially significant pain.What are the risks?The risks associated with tattoos range from skin breaching to allergic reactions.As a result, one risks skin infections among other complications.When it comes to blood donation, a donor with a tattoo on them cannot be allowed to donate blood unless the said tattoo is more than a year old.Experts further say tattoo dyes especially red, green, yellow and blue can cause allergic skin reactions, such as an itchy rash at the tattoo site. This can occur even years after you get the tattoo.Despite the risks of skin infection, sometimes an area of inflammation called a granuloma can form around tattoo ink.Tattooing also can lead to keloids which are raised areas caused by an overgrowth of scar tissue.""If the equipment used to create your tattoo is contaminated with infected blood, you can contract various bloodborne diseases including methicillin- a resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), hepatitis B and hepatitis C,"" Mayo clinic quotes.Though tattoos or permanent makeup rarely cause swelling or burning in the affected areas during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams but in some cases, tattoo pigments can interfere with the quality of the image.How to take good care of a tattooHow one cares for a new tattoo depends on the type and extent of work done. But basically, one has to use plain soap and water and a gentle touch to keep the tattooed skin clean.While showering, one should avoid direct streams of water on the newly tattooed skin. They should then apply a mild moisturiser to the tattooed skin several times a day  and avoid sun exposure for at least a few weeks.One should also avoid swimming by staying out of pools, hot tubs, rivers, lakes and other bodies of water before the tattoo heals.One must also carefully choose their clothing to avoid wearing anything that might stick on the tattoo.For at least two weeks of healing, one should not pick at any scabs which increases the risk of infection and can damage the design.If one thinks their tattoo might be infected or they are concerned that the tattoo isn't healing properly, they should immediately seek help from a dermatologist."
298,Mpesa Fraud: Conmen pose as Safaricom staff to steal from unsuspecting users,"It was a Saturday morning, a day after the new year and Joseph Mburu was relaxing in his house.At around 8 am, he got a call from someone who claimed he was a Safaricom Customer care staff.Mburu who hails from Eastlands told the Star that the caller, a male staff notified him that his line had had double registration and they were trying to sort out the issue.""Aliniambia eti line yangu imeregistiwa mara mbili, kwa njina langu na mtu anaitwa Esther Njeri. So akasema ndio laini yangu isifungwe, anahitaji kuniuliza masawali kadhaa,"" Mburu said.(He told me that my line had been registered twice on my name and a user called Esther Njeri. So for my line not to be locked, he said he would ask me some questions to verify the line really belongs to me).Mburu said the caller asked him to state the last amount of top-up he had done and the last two numbers he had dialled which he did.He was then directed to M-Pesa details and without knowing, he revealed his details thinking the caller was a Safaricom staff.Some minutes later, he got a notification that his Sh15,000 had been withdrawn.""I was shocked and in fact, I thought I was dreaming. It later hit me that I had been duped. I tried to reach out to Safaricom for help but it was too late,"" he said.Grace Lumbasi, a wife and a mother to teenage girls told the Star that through similar tricks, her entire saving was withdrawn.She said on Sunday, January 3 she was relaxing in her room because she was feeling unwell.""I was sleeping after I took medication until my last born daughter woke me that I had a call. When I answered, the caller, a man told me that my M-Pesa had been blocked because my line had some complications,"" Lumbasi said.According to her, the caller notified her that she would not be able to do any M-Pesa transactions unless the issue is sorted out.""Since I was feeling unwell, I did not even think through, Immediately asked him how they could help since I was convinced that he was a Safaricom Staff. He asked me some lead questions which I responded to"" she said.A few minutes later, she was shocked to get a notification that her M-Pesa balance was zero.""I have never been duped like this, I almost fainted. I had sacrificed a lot despite the coronavirus pandemic to save something to help me in this year, then just in minutes someone walks away with it,"" she said.She said she had saved some Sh55,000 and she intended to use part of the money to pay school fees for her kids while the remaining to buy a cow.""I have always wanted to own a cow and I knew my dream was coming true, now I don't know where to start,"" she said.Mburu and Lumbasi are among many other Kenyans who have fallen victims to such tricks costing them fortunes.The Star has established that the conmen have devised ways in which they lure unsuspecting targets.Fraudsters are always devising new ways to con people. Since it is hard for scammers to infiltrate the M-Pesa system, they opt for non-technical methods, or social engineering, as it is popularly known. This involves tricking unsuspecting people into breaking normal security procedures and finally manipulating them into among other things, revealing M-Pesa PIN or withdrawing from ATMs remotely.""What is shocking is how the conmen get to know someone's both names, the last amount they toped-up, and M-Pesa details,"" Mburu said.To him, even if is it is the work of conmen, insiders within Safaricom must have a hand by providing key information to the conmen.A story ran by BBC news in 2018 also reveals how several users had fallen victims to such tricks.One of the users said that when the conman called, he was confused, he had not asked for a new card - and just moments earlier he had terminated a call that he now realised must have been from a fraudster who had posed as a customer services adviser from the phone company.As he sought to inquire from Safaricom, he completely lost access to his number and only got back control after three days.Despite the fact that the user had not given out any details, he lost all the money on his M-Pesa account.But the telecommunication company told the Star that it has been running a campaign on fraud advising customers that it only calls from the 0722000000 line.A senior officer who sought anonymity said the company has also been advising customers to not give out information to fraudsters.He said anti-fraud campaigns are running on all platforms including television, radio stations and all vernacular stations.""The basis of a media story should begin with facts not 'is it true', otherwise there are very many claims that are unsubstantiated and fly every day,"" he said.To him, users should just be cautious as fraudsters call numbers at random.Safaricom remains the biggest telecommunications provider in the country and one of the most profitable companies in the region.It controls approximately 63.5 per cent of the Kenyan market and as at 30 June 2019, it had a subscriber base estimated at 33.1 million.In terms of the voice market and SMS market share, Safaricom controls 56.8 per cent and 95.5 per cent respectively.Safaricom was formed in 1997 as a fully owned subsidiary of Telkom Kenya."

300,US issues visa restrictions on Tanzanians for undermining democracy,"The US has announced visa restrictions on the Tanzanian officials who undermined the credibility of the October 28, 2020, general elections.In a statement on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo the actions of the targeted officials subverted the electoral process, continuing the downward trajectory of the country’s democracy.“Election observers and civil society noted widespread irregularities as well as human rights abuses and violations before, during, and after the election…we emphasise that today’s actions are not directed at the Tanzanian people,” Pompeo said.The Secretary of State added that during the electioneering period, the opposition candidates were routinely disqualified, harassed, and arrested. “Significant and widespread voting irregularities, internet disruptions, intimidation of journalists, and violence by security forces made this election neither free nor fair.”Pompeo said that the civil society leaders remain under threat in the post-election period and that the opposition leaders have fled the country out of fear for their safety.At the same time, the government of Tanzania has been urged to reverse course and hold accountable those responsible for the flawed election, violence, and intimidation. “The United States will continue to closely follow developments in Tanzania and will not hesitate to take additional actions against individuals complicit in undermining democracy and violating human rights.”Also, Tanzanians who participated in the election peacefully and in good faith have been lauded, with the US adding that it will work together with all those committed to advancing democracy, human rights, and mutual prosperity.President John Pombe Magufuli secured his second term in office with 80 per cent of votes, but the outcome was dismissed by the main opposition party candidate Tundu Lissu.The authorities arrested Tundu Lissu, who was the Chadema presidential candidate for attempts to undermine peace.Later, Lissu left the country claiming that his life was in danger.Also, Chadema chairman Freeman Mbowe was detained, along with two other Chadema leaders, for planning violent protests, according to the police."
301,"Trump pardons rappers Lil Wayne, Kodak Black on his last day as President","Rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black were among the beneficiaries of Donald Trump's wave of pardons in his last day in office on Wednesday, befitting a president who made his name in New York's tabloids and on reality TV.While the more than 140 people granted clemency included former aide Steve Bannon and major Republican Party fundraiser Elliott Broidy, Trump also used his wide-ranging powers to clear people with little apparent ties to his administration.Five-time Grammy Award winner Lil Wayne, whose legal name is Dwayne Carter Jr., appeared to support Trump on the campaign trail ahead of Trump's re-election bid when Carter said he backed Trump's criminal justice reform program and economic plan for African Americans.Carter, whose 2016 single ""No Problem"" won the Best Rap Performance Grammy, pleaded guilty last month to illegally possessing a loaded, gold-plated handgun when his chartered jet landed in Miami in December 2019. He faced a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.Black, 23, who was born Bill Kahan Kapri, is in federal prison for making a false statement to buy a firearm and released the album ""Bill Israel"" from behind bars.Black pleaded guilty in August 2019, and three months later was sentenced to three years and 10 months in prison. He was seeking compassionate release and his commutation was supported by religious leaders, other rappers and athletes.Despite speculation, the list did not include the subject of the Netflix series ""Tiger King"", Joe Exotic, who is serving a 22-year prison sentence for plotting to kill a rival and animal cruelty.Most presidents have issued pardons late in their terms. Usually processed through the Office of the Pardon Attorney, they are intended to address cases in which the punishment is outsized compared to the crime.Trump, who delivered his first pardon in August 2017, his first year in office, had issued 70 in total before Wednesday, many of which have been given to people who are friendly with his administration.Trump's pardons have also included some people tied to celebrities, including Alice Marie Johnson, a woman convicted on drug charges whose case was championed by reality television star Kim Kardashian West.Trump has gotten involved with criminal justice cases affecting celebrities in other ways as well.In 2019, Trump sought to intervene when A$AP Rocky was detained in Sweden after a brawl in downtown Stockholm.

302,Uhuru has not endorsed me for President - Mudavadi,"Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi has dispelled claims that President Uhuru Kenyatta endorsed him for the top seat during the burial of his mother Hannah Atsianzale on January 9.He said the President only sparked a conversation that it may be time for leaders from other communities to lead the country.“Uhuru has not endorsed me. He is a person who will never impose a leader on the people,” he stated.Mudavadi noted that he will be contesting for the presidency in 2022 and will be seeking the votes of Mt Kenya region.“When the time comes, I will come back to ask for your support. For now, we should be discussing how to revive the economy,” he said.“There is nothing wrong with what the President said. If you have a good manifesto and qualities of a leader, Kenyans will elect you their president no matter your tribe.”Speaking on Kameme FM- a leading Kikuyu radio station- on Wednesday morning, Mudavadi made a passionate appeal to Mt Kenya region to rally behind the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).Mudavadi's call came just a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta asked his Mt Kenya backyard to rally behind the Constitution amendment drive.Mudavadi said Mt Kenya residents need to support the BBI since their region stands to benefit more from the Constitution amendment.“You are the people who were saying on one man, one vote, one shilling. This was well captured and you have more constituencies. If you do not want the new constituencies, give them to us in western,” he stated.President Uhuru on Monday morning took to Kikuyu vernacular stations to directly appeal to his Mt Kenya backyard to support the BBI. Uhuru said the problem facing BBI was that the perception created was that the drive was about supporting one person and undermining another.Mudavadi defended efforts to amend the constitution at a time when the country was faced with a pandemic and an ailing economy.“We need to have a consensus to avoid going to a referendum sharply divided. This way, the country will save on security and other costs. We also need to put this matter behind us. We have been talking about it for three years now. It is like a boil which needs to be removed for you to heal,” he added.The ANC party leader was however quick to point out that the constitutional amendment would not solve all of the country's problems.Mudavadi at the same time took a swipe on Deputy President William Ruto and a section of leaders from the region for opposing the Constitution Amendment Bill 2020.“If you continue to oppose the document, then you are hypocritical. We all said what we wanted to be changed in the first draft and it was done. The Deputy President also said what he wanted to be changed,” he added.The ANC party leader, however, added that he does not have personal differences with the Deputy President.Mudavadi said Ruto should quit the government if he does not want to bear the responsibility of its failures.“He is in the government of the day. However, we are seeing a scenario where he wants to be in the government and opposition at the same time,” he stated.Mudavadi further appealed to Mt Kenya region to wisely elect their leaders during the next elections.“Interrogate before you vote. Do not vote then interrogate,” he advised."
303,Trump's farewell: We did what we came to do,"US President Donald Trump has made his farewell address before leaving office, saying: ""We did what we came to do - and so much more.""In a video posted on YouTube, he said he took on ""the tough battles, the hardest fights... because that's what you elected me to do"".Mr Trump has still not fully accepted the result of last November's election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.Mr Biden will be sworn in as president on Wednesday.The last two weeks of Mr Trump's term have been dominated by the fallout from the deadly riot on Capitol Hill, when a mob of his supporters stormed Congress, seeking to overturn the election result.""Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated,"" Mr Trump said in his video, in which he did not acknowledge his successor by name.What else did Trump say?Mr Trump himself has been impeached for ""incitement of insurrection"" over the attack and will face trial in the Senate after he leaves office. If convicted, he could be barred from standing for public office.He is the first president in US history to be impeached twice. At his first trial, he was cleared on charges relating to dealings with Ukraine by the majority from his own Republican Party.The politically motivated violence has overshadowed the growing toll from the coronavirus pandemic, in which more than 400,000 Americans have died and 24 million have been infected.In his message, Mr Trump said his administration built ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"".US stock markets have rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index up 42% in 2020, and the wider S&P 500 up 15%.However, the rest of the economy is facing more of a struggle. Employers cut jobs in December, ending a string of job gains. Retail sales have dropped in recent months, while jobless claims rise.""Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn't about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation,"" Mr Trump said.He leaves office with an approval rating of 34%, a record low for a departing president.Donald Trump, in his 20-minute pre-recorded farewell speech, said his administration did what it came to do and more.One can debate the significance of his accomplishments - whether 400 miles (640km) of rebuilt border wall, tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, confirmed judges, trade wars and modest Mid-East diplomatic agreements amount to much in the way of substantive achievement.But at least in one way, his boast is certainly true. Trump ran for president in 2016 to shake up the existing political order. He campaigned as an outsider giving voice to those who distrusted the establishment and felt the system no longer worked for them.""I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that's what you elected me to do,"" he said.The unrest and resentment that Trump rode to the White House crested and crashed on the US Capitol two weeks ago, leaving behind wreckage - literal and metaphorical - that will take time and effort to clear.After four years of shattered norms and traditions, of turning expectations of presidential behaviour on their head, Trump leaves US government changed - fundamentally and, perhaps, irreversibly.That, at least, was a promise made and a promise kept."
304,State wants court to dismiss Wairimu's bid to drop murder charge,"The state has opposed a bid by Sarah Wairimu to stop her prosecution for the alleged murder of her late husband Tob Cohen.Wairimu moved to court in November last year and asked that the murder charges against her be dropped.However, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations argued that the case filed by Wairimu is an abuse of the court process.In court documents, the state says the petition raises matters that are subjudice to the case.They also say that the  constitutional court has no jurisdiction to grant an order in a matter that is pending before the criminal division of the High Court, which is of concurrent jurisdiction.The case was mentioned on Tuesday before Justice James Makau who said he will rule on whether he has jurisdiction to handle the case on March 11.In her petition, Wairimu through lawyer Phillip Murgor argues that the case was lodged in bad faith.She claims the prosecutor wants to deny her the right to inherit her matrimonial properties following the death of her husband.Wairimu says that the investigative agencies and the police violated the Constitution in mounting the case against her and arresting her without a warrant.She claims that the police confiscated her phones, accessed her private conversations, including privileged communication with her lawyers, breaching her right to privacy.Murgor argues that the prosecution has not supplied the defence with evidence to enable them to prepare a substantive rebuttal in defending the accused.Wairimu also wants the court to direct the state to release her vehicles, the house and its furnishings, as well as dogs Major and Snow.Murgor says that the petition raises weighty constitutional questions that deserve to be heard and determined by a three-judge bench."
305,State tightens anti-bribery laws in radical proposals,"The government has proposed tough laws in renewed efforts to rid state agencies and the private sector of bribery.New regulations drawn by Attorney General Kihara Kariuki provide that all organisations put in place procedures for preventing bribery and corruption.The Draft Bribery Regulations, 2020, provide that the said procedures will have to be in writing — in English and Kiswahili — or any other language as may be appropriate.The Bribery Act, 2019, makes it mandatory for all public and private entities to put the said procedures in place.A company or its directors or senior officers that fail to put in place the procedures would risk a Sh5 million fine or 10 years in jail or both.“An entity or its directors, senior officer or other responsible person shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding Sh5 million, or to imprisonment to a term not exceeding ten years or to both.”The regulations, if passed in Parliament, will enable the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to enforce the bribery rules.It will apply to all state organs and public bodies in the three arms of government; county governments, constitutional commissions and independent offices.“A state officer, public officer or any other person holding a position of authority in a public or private entity shall report to the commission any knowledge or suspicion of instances of bribery involving that private or public entity that comes to his or her knowledge,” the rules say.Entities under a public-private partnership and any that renders a service to the public as a monopoly are required to comply.The new rules, the draft reads, will apply to all state officers and private entities with virtual presence.In developing the procedures, entities would be required to asses and map out bribery and corruption risks in the operational areas.“Corruption risk assessment shall include identification and analysis of the bribery and corruption risks that an entity faces in its operations,” the AG said.Managers will have to ensure there is commitment from the top leadership to abide by the procedures. If approved, entities will be required to appoint a senior officer responsible for overseeing the implementation of the graft prevention procedures.The arrangement will be required to be in a way that employees of all cadres are involved in preventing bribery.Managers have to state mechanism of receiving, recording, processing, and disseminating reports for appropriate action and feedback.“The procedures shall take into account fair administrative action,” the implementation guidelines read.Entities will also be expected to provide measures for protection of whistleblowers, informants, and witnesses.Organisations will thus have to state their scale of business  — the number of employees, gross annual turnover, exchequer allocation; geographical spread of operations.They will also state nature of business — service or production orientation; carrying on business as a monopoly or otherwise.Entities will also spell the risk of bribery and corruption inherent in its operations and its origins — local or foreign, among other attributes.Subsidiaries, the draft reads, can adopt those of their parent entity while those operating as joint ventures will have each treated as a separate entity.“A local entity that establishes branches for purposes of its operations shall be responsible for ensuring compliance, irrespective of whether the branch or branches operate independently or semi-autonomously,” the regulations read.“An entity that is a franchisee of another entity, whether local or foreign, shall be responsible for establishing its own procedures.”This would be irrespective of whether the franchisor has established its own procedures or for the franchise network. “An entity which operates on a virtual platform shall demonstrate compliance on the platform in which it operates,” the proposed rules read. A report of bribery, the regulations read, will include date and time of bribery incident; name of complainant (in case of any), and particulars of allegation.Reports will also have to show the location, names of parties involved, value and nature of advantage involved – including how the same was transacted.The rules provide that the EACC will maintain a record of all reports made in its quarterly report and state action taken. “The commission shall ensure strict confidentiality when receiving any report of instances of bribery.”"
306,Man who touched girl's breast in a matatu guilty of indecent act,"A Makadara court has found guilty of an indecent act a man who touched the breast of an 11-year-old girl in a matatu in 2017.The charge sheet says Benjamin Kemboi committed the offence on February, 14 four years ago along Mwiki-Kasarani road.He denied the charges and the prosecution called four witnesses to testify.Makadara principal magistrate Merissa Opondo on January 14 said the court would admit the girl’s evidence.“I found that the complainant when she was giving her evidence in court was bold and had a clear understanding of the issues and events that took place on that day,” she said.The girl said she was at Santon bus stop waiting for her friend so that they could go to school together.While still there, Kemboi came, tapped her on the shoulder and asked her to follow him so he could help her board a vehicle.They boarded a full vehicle and Kemboi asked her to sit on his lap.By the time they reached Hunter's bus stop, a few kilometres from where they boarded the matatu, Kemboi had started touching and caressing her.She informed a woman who was sitting next to them that Kemboi was touching her inappropriately. The woman raised the alarm and told Kemboi they would report him to the police.At the next bus stop, Kemboi tried to escape through the window but was arrested by members of the public.He was put back in the car and escorted to Kasarani police station where the matter was reported.The driver and his conductor escorted the girl to school after the mother was informed of the incident.Catherine Mukhani, a prosecution witness, said she had sat next to Kemboi and the girl and noticed she was uneasy.She asked if anything was the matter and the girl said Kemboi was touching her private parts.In court, Kemboi said he is a husband and a father of four and had no ill motive when he offered to carry the girl on his lap.Kemboi said that he took off as he feared for his life after other passengers started calling him a sex predator and saying he deserved to die.Magistrate Opondo said Kemboi’s attempt to escape created an impression of his guilt.“The accused had no reasonable justification as to why he took off yet he would have pleaded his innocence and even be allowed to prove the same before any authority if he was being falsely accused,” she said.Opondo summoned the complainant’s mother to appear in court and provide a victim impact statement before sentencing."
307,Ruto Rift Valley critics isolated as DP consolidates backyard,"A charm offensive by Deputy President William Ruto to firm up his grip on the Rift Valley bastion has sent his rivals back to the drawing board.The DP, who has faced a political onslaught from President Uhuru Kenyatta and key Opposition bigwigs, has sought to consolidate the vast Rift region ahead of the 2022 General Election.His move is likely to isolate and jolt some of his fiercest critics from the region as he lays ground for a first stab at the presidency next year.The DP's allies have also softened attacks on their rivals from the region in a game plan to court them to to join the Tangatanga camp.  The ceasefire is also a scheme to reduce antagonism and whittle down animosity within Ruto's backyard.On Tuesday, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, one of the DP's fiercest defenders, remained upbeat the Rift Valley will be placed under lock and key by Ruto's camp.“There is nothing to hide about the DP's popularity across the region and that is why you will continue to see many leaders declaring their support to work with him, they are joining the winning team,” Sudi said.According to Sudi, the DP is willing and ready to work with all leaders from the Rift Valley and, indeed across the country, as the 2022 presidential contest gets down to the wire.Emurua Dikir MP Johana Ngeno, a former-critic-turned-buddy, declared the Rift Valley is the DP's stronghold and will not be permeated by 'junior rivals'.“The Deputy President wants to work with all leaders in the Rift Valley and beyond irrespective of their political differences; he is determined to forge unity of purpose,” he said.Ngeno said the DP has elaborate plans to have the people of the expansive region speak in one voice ahead of 2022.“Part of what is happening is that of consolidating the gains we have made and breaking into new territories by bringing all leaders together,” he said.In the last week, the DP has held a couple of meetings and harambees in his Rift Valley turf.More public engagements are on the cards to maintain the DP's visibility on the ground amid the looming BBI campaigns.Ruto is said to be keen on wooing back to his political fold some of his critics from the region, complicating options for his rivals including Kanu chairman Gideon Moi.Already, Ruto has bagged former Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, his hitherto antagonist from the South Rift, successfully managing to neutralise Moi's influence.There are efforts to have West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo, a Kanu member cross over to his side as the window of alignments and realignments sweeps across the Rift Valley.The DP over the weekend visited Lonyangapuo at his Eldoret office, signaling the unfolding political machinations by Ruto's camp to isolate Moi.Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos, a key Gideon ally, is said to be targeted by Ruto's political strategists. Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny and his Nandi Hills counterpart Alfred Keter have been breathing hot and cold on their political allegiance to either Ruto or Gideon.Gideon is backed by a handful of MPs including Moiben's Silas Tiren, William Kamket (Tiaty) and Ainabkoi MP William Chepkut.On Tuesday, Kamket played down the DP's influence in the Rift Valley saying the Building Bridges Initiative referendum will vanquish him.“He is just a paper tiger,” declared Kamket. Gideon has a plan that would annihilate the DP ahead of the 2022 polls, he said. “Kanu, as we have said, will soon roll out its road map to activate the grassroots and strengthen branches as we ready for next year. Nobody should try to wish away Kanu,” Kamket said.Gideon, the scion of Kenya's second President is embroiled in a bitter rivalry with Ruto amid signals their frosty ties would further deteriorate ahead of next year's presidential duel.Gideon is aligned to President Uhuru' Kenyatta's wing of Jubilee Party after he inked a post-election coalition with the ruling outfit last year, further escalating his differences with Ruto.Gideon's dalliance with Uhuru and Raila has put him at the succession matrix, often threatening the DP's fortunes in the Rift Valley.There have been indications that Gideon would cobble up an alliance with Raila in a bid to block Ruto's ascension to the presidency."
308,Judiciary starts search for new CJ,"The Judiciary has announced the recruitment of retired Chief Justice David Maraga’s successor.The gazette notice signed by acting CJ Philomena Mwilu comes a week after Maraga retired.The notice that declares the office vacant invites those interested in the position to put in their application for consideration by the Judicial Service Commission.Applicants must be advocates of the High Court with 15 years experience or be High Court or Appeal Court judges or experience as a distinguished academic, judicial officer, legal practitioner or such relevant experience in other relevant field. Interested candidates must have high moral character, integrity and impartiality as well as meet requirements of Chapter six of the Constitution on Leadership and Integrity.  Among the persons who have expressed interest are Senior Counsel and former Director of Public Prosecutions Philip Murgor. Others being mentioned include Justice Mwilu, Court of Appeal President William Ouko, Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and his predecessor Prof Githu Muigai. The successful candidate will get a gross salary of between Sh990,000 and Sh1,327,888 minus allowances. The holder of the office of the CJ will be tasked with heading Judiciary, which is the third arm of government, chair the JSC and serve as president of the Supreme Court.In 2016, Justice Maraga beat 13 other candidates to succeed Willy Mutunga, who retired a year early. The JSC had planned to commence the recruitment in October last year, six months to the retirement of justice Maraga but the move was thwarted by the CJ and a section of the members of the commission, arguing that it was against the law.A full JSC meeting to discuss the matter was cancelled at the last minute and was never called again until Maraga finished his term.The JSC faction that opposed the early start of recruitment process was of the view that it was against the law.The law does not provide for advance recruitment of the Chief Justice until the mandate of the office holder expires.The law only anticipates a vacancy when the holder resigns, dies, retires or attains the age of 70 years or is removed as prescribed by law. The JSC Act provides for the transparent recruitment of judges including the Chief Justice that the JSC shall constitute a selection panel consisting of at least five members."
309,New rules strike blow at breast milk substitutes,"The government seeks to promote and support breastfeeding with a string of measures aimed at curbing substitutes for mothers' milk.The Ministry of Health has developed new regulations to deter inappropriate marketing and distribution of breast milk substitutes, which it said expose infants to health risks.The Breast Milk Substitute (General) Regulations, 2020, was drafted by the ministry jointly with the National Committee on Infant and Young Child Feeding, the Kenya Law Reform Commission and the Office of the Attorney General.All manufacturers or importers of the products will be required to register with the Nutrition and Dietetic Division of the Ministry of Health.Containers with the infant formula will be required to have a label stating: “Breast milk is best. Breast milk is ideal for the healthy growth and development of infants and young children. It protects against potentially fatal diarrhoea, lung infections and other illnesses.”The words will be expressed in both English and Kiswahili in bold and conspicuous letters in a prominent position not less than 50 per cent the size of the container.The container or package shall not show the logo of the manufacturer or distributor, or contain images that idealise the use of teats.The containers or packages will also be required to indicate in words: “Use of teats interfere with breastfeeding,” which will be preceded by a warning.The regulations further say interactions between a manufacturer or distributor with health workers shall strictly be limited.A manufacturer or distributor who wishes to create awareness of scientific and factual matters of the breast milk substitute shall apply in writing to the ministry for approval.The regulations note that the Cabinet Secretary responsible for public health may from time to time review the rules for the betterment of the Breast Milk Substitutes (Regulation and Control) Act, 2012.“If a person is found to breach any provisions of these regulations two or more times, the Cabinet Secretary responsible for public health may issue an order for a penalty to be issued in relation to each violation,” the regulations state.Substitutes are usually prescribed for mothers who cannot breastfeed, after a period of trying breastfeeding with full counselling and support and when there are acceptable medical reasons. They are also recommended when a national authority decides to promote formula feeding as the primary infant feeding method for HIV-infected mothers.Breast milk is considered nature's perfect baby food as it contains immunity-boosting antibodies and healthful protein that scientists have yet to replicate. Many medical experts strongly recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months.WHO recommends mothers worldwide to exclusively breastfeed infants for the child's first six months to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Thereafter, they should be given nutritious complementary foods and continue breastfeeding up to the age of two years or beyond.Breast milk is always fresh, perfectly clean, just the right temperature, and is the healthy choice at the least cost.The regulations further say an authorised officer may from time to time collect and submit to a public analyst a sample of a designated product or a pre-packaged complementary food supplement for analysis.In a letter to National Assembly clerk Michael Sialai, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said his office is ready to engage the Committee on Delegated Legislation on the content of the regulations."
310,Bomet elder dies from anthrax outbreak,"Fear has hit a village in Sotik after a man died while six others were hospitalised after allegedly coming into contact with the carcass of an animal suspected to have died of anthrax.The 60-year-old man from Itoik village died early Tuesday morning at Kaplong Mission Hospital where he was receiving treatment.He is said to have participated in disposing the carcass of the cow.It is, however, unclear whether the group feasted on the animal. Health officials said the deceased had pale wounds, a sign suggesting he may have consumed the meat.The six who are admitted to Tenwek Hospital in Bomet are out of danger.According to residents, seven cows have already died in the area following suspected anthrax outbreak a week ago.Kapkures chief David Langat confirmed the incident, saying the area is prone to cases of anthrax.County director of veterinary Dr Wilson Serem confirmed the outbreak of the disease but was to quick to exonerate his office from any blame saying the cases were not reported to them.Addressing the press, Dr Serem confirmed the area covering Kipsonoi and Mutarakwa are prone to the disease, saying every year cases of the disease are reported.He said the vaccination of animals against the disease will start in the next one week.“Anyone whose cow dies with symptoms that resemble anthrax should report to us immediately…they should not touch it to avert infections and deaths,” Serem said.On Wednesday morning, public health officials and the Kenya Red Cross team visited the area to sensitise locals against coming into contact with dead animals.Edited by Henry Makori"
311,"Nurses to engage counties, Cotu boss slams governors","The nurses’ union has decided to negotiate with county governments that have expressed willingness to sign return-to-work agreements.A number of counties want to sign, then reneged, showing lack of good faith by the Council of Governors, nurses say.Wednesday is Day 45 of the nurses' strike. They were joined by medical clinicians and lab technicians. Doctors have returned to work.The union has said it is ready to rewrite the agreement, have the counties sign and the nurses will return to work.Despite negotiations between the unions and a multi-agency committee concluding work more than two weeks ago, the document remains at the Ministry of Labour - unsigned.Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya has maintained governors won’t sign because they say they were excluded from the talks. Health unions have rejected his claims.“I will not mention the counties because (CoG chairman Wycliffe) Oparanya will go and sabotage. He is trying to show he is very powerful and he can cripple individuals.""Already 10 governors have reached out to us. They want a county-based agreement based on agreement at the national level,” KNUN secretary general Seth Panyako said.“I can be sure before the end of the week we can have about 10 county governments signing the return-to-work agreement with this union with the terms and conditions as agreed - and there even will be a little modification we shall accept at that level,” the Kenya National Union of Nurses boss said.The Central Organisation of Trade Unions, meanwhile, denounced the way county governments are handling the health crisis.Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli criticised Oparanya for saying healthcare workers earn more than enough, saying such comments are unacceptable, ill-advised and morally wrong.Nurses and clinical officers in 34 counties went on strike on December 7 to demand higher allowances, adequate personal protective equipment, comprehensive medical insurance cover and an end to salary delays, among other demands.But the governors said they are some of the best paid civil servants in the counties and perhaps do not deserve any more pay. Any pay rise is untenable and will distort counties' payroll - then everyone will want more money, they said.“Together with his colleagues, Oparanya should take responsibility for the health crisis this country faces,"" Atwoli said. ""Chest-thumping and threats against striking health workers will not provide any solution,” he said.Atwoli said Cotu appreciates the initiative by the national government through the Health and Labour ministries. The CoG should take a cue from this and find a better way to engage health workers for the sake of many suffering Kenyans,” the unionist said.Atwoli wants county governments to stop politicising the matter. He said the country is treading on shaky ground and with children back in school, another pandemic would be catastrophic.“We should not allow ourselves to get there as a result of such irresponsible and crude utterances from leaders who have perfected the art of arrogance whenever they are before a microphone,"" Atwoli said.He said Oparanya as a leader should respond cautiously, responsibly and intelligently to health workers and not respond ""as if he has just landed from the moon with a huge big-man syndrome"".Panyako said the governors and the national government should implement the risk allowance approved by SRC in 2017 and pay all arrears.He said the SRC approved a risk allowance of Sh5,000 for nurses in 2018 and at the same time it approved other allowances for doctors and clinical officers.Despite the ones for doctors and clinical officers being implemented, the nurses' allowances were never implemented, Panyako said. (Edited by V.

312,Trump imposes visa restrictions on un-named Tanzanians,"The US has imposed visa restrictions on Tanzanian officials it says were responsible for undermining the general elections last October.The outgoing Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, said those targeted subverted the electoral process and violated human rights.He said the intimidation and arrest of opposition candidates, widespread voting irregularities and internet disruptions meant the polls were neither free nor fair.The October election was won by the incumbent John Magufuli with more than 80% of the vote.A state department statement on the visa directive did not name the sanctioned Tanzanian officials.Today is the last full working day for President Donald Trump, his successor Joe Biden will be sworn in on Wednesday as the 46th president of the US."
313,"CRA gives counties Sh370 billion, endorses Uhuru’s deal with senators","The Commission on Revenue Allocation has endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta’s pledge to allocate county governments an additional Sh53.5 billion in 2021-22 financial year.The Commission on Tuesday recommended that the counties be allocated Sh370 billion as equitable share, up from Sh316.5 billion in the current financial yearIn its recommendations on the basis for equitable sharing of revenue between national and county governments, CRA suggests that the national government should receive the huge chunk of the national cake – Sh1.44 trillion.The allocation is out of the projected shareable revenue of Sh1.81 trillion and projected Road Maintenance Levy Fund of Sh65.13 billion.Articles 216(1) (a) and 203 (1) of the Constitution mandates the commission to recommend to Parliament the vertical (between National and County governments) and horizontal (among counties) sharing of revenues generated nationally.In September, the President pledged the additional allocation, ending months of standoff in the senate over the third generation formula.Uhuru said the additional allocation will go towards strengthening devolution. However, his pledge was pegged on the performance of revenue collection by the Kenya Revenue Authority.The National Treasury has admitted experiencing cash flow challenges owing to the Covid 19 pandemic that has hit revenue collection.In a statement, the commission its consulted Parliament, the Council of Governors and the National Treasury.According to the recommendations, the allocation of Sh370 billion to county governments constitutes a baseline equitable share allocation of Sh316.5 billion, which is the baseline and unconditional allocation of Sh17.02 billion to be shared by all counties.“These allocations were previously allocated as conditional grants for health, roads and education,” reads the statement in part.In addition, some Sh36.48 billion will be transferred from Ministries, Departments and Agencies to the devolved units for performance of concurrent functions in the areas of health, crop development, livestock, fisheries, water, irrigation and sanitation.“Further, in accordance with the provision of the PFMA 2012 Section 190(b), the Commission presents the determination of each county's equitable share based on the Third Basis for revenue sharing approved by Parliament in September 2020,” it added.The contentious third basis for sharing revenue among the counties had last year split the senators down the middle, with those whose counties were set to ‘lose’ revenue in the proposed formula, vehemently rejecting it.Some counties that were to lose billions of shillings in revenue formula backed by Senate committee on Budget and finance include those from the Northern Frontier region, Coast and Ukambani.The protracted standoff characterized by 10 adjournments, aborted Kamukunjis, arrests, intimidation, bribery claims and blackmail.However, it is the Sh53 billion pledge by the President that induced a section of aggrieved senators to debate and vote on the formula to unlock the release of cash to counties.The new formula factors eight parameters; basic share (20 per cent) population (18 per cent) health (17 per cent), agriculture (10 per cent), poverty level (14 per cent) and urban (five per cent), with roads and land at eight per cent each.Nairobi, Nakuru, Kiambu and Turkana are the top gainers in the new formula. Nairobi County will get an additional Sh3.3 billion from the exchequer, to push its total allocation to Sh19.2 billion from the current Sh15.9 billion.Nakuru’s share will balloon to Sh13 billion up from the current Sh10.4 billion while Kiambu will get an additional Sh2.2 billion to push its total allocation to Sh11.7 billion, while Turkana’s allocation will shoot to Sh12.6 billion from Sh10.5 billion.Tharaka Nithi, Nyamira, Vihiga, Isiolo and Kwale will get least addition to their current allocations in the new formula that ensures no county loses revenue.Tharaka Nithi will get additional Sh289.6 million to push its total allocation to Sh4.2 billion from the current Sh3.9 billion.Nyamira will receive Sh324.5 million more, Vihiga will get an additional Sh414.8 million, Isiolo will get Sh469.2 million more while Kwale will receive an additional Sh479.6 million to push its total allocation to Sh8.2 billion from Sh7.7 billion.Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru, who chairs the House committee on Budget and Finance termed the new proposals by CRA as an improvement from the last allocation.“Once the allocation is unconditional, it becomes part of the equitable share. So, the commission has considered the President’s Sh50 billion and we are happy,” Kibiru told the Star on phone."
314,Concerns over 10-month delay in recruitment of KNCHR chiefs,"Concerns are mounting over the delayed recruitment of commissioners at the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights 10 months after the posts fell vacant.Kagwiria Mbogori, George Morara, Jedidah Waruhiu and Suzanne Chivusia left office in March last year after their six-year term ended. They were appointed in 2014.The commission has since been under the care of its secretariat.Former commissioner Waruhiu told the Star that the absence of substantive commissioners is hurting the effectiveness of the commission in fulfilling its mandate.“It is unfortunate that the commission has remained without appointed commissioners and hence unable to effectively carry out its most-needed business. The government needs to move with speed to fill these vacancies,” Waruhiu said.The commission serves as the link between the government and the civil society, helping to bring to attention of the state issues of concern related to human rights.The commission also helps the state inculcate human rights approach in its policy decision and implementation.But without the commissioners, the agency cannot transact business effectively as there are commitments that only the commissioners can make on its behalf.“Without the commissioners, nothing virtually moves. There are businesses the secretariat cannot transact,” Hussein Khalid, the executive director of Coast-based Haki Africa said.“It is something worth piling pressure on as the delayed recruitment is a kin to the state crippling the commission and the larger human rights agenda,” Khalid added.Waruhiu said during their term, KNCHR suffered consistent under-funding from the government, making it to largely depend on magnanimity of partners and foreign donors.“Since we were appointed in 2014, we always sought a budget of Sh1 billion. But the Treasury never gave us even half [of it] throughout our tenure. This obviously meant that most of the programmes the commission lined up to do in furtherance of its mandate could not be afforded,” she said.Suba Churchill, the convenor of Civil Society Reference Group, concurred that absence of commissioners exposes the commission to court challenges as the power of the entity vests in the commission.""Like the case Charity Ngilu brought against EACC, someone can go to court to challenge any action or decision taken by the secretariat in the absence of commissioners, leading to nullification,"" Churchill said.""In other words, not appointing the commissioners has practically rendered the entity dysfunctional. The CEO is an ex-officio member of the commission and cannot purport to operate it. In any case, he lacks the quorum to make commission decisions,"" he said.In the Ngilu v. EACC case, the Kitui governor had sued the commission to challenge her arrest and prosecution when she was the Lands CS, her case predicated on the fact that there were no substantive commissioners.The court agreed with her, ruling that a constitutional commission cannot work legally without appointment of substantive commissioners.Churchill fears that the delay is part of the hostility of the state against the civil society and entities that champion respect for human rights values in government and policy administration.Like every other constitutional commission, the law requires that recruitment of commissioners starts with the gazzettement of vacancies and forming a selection committee to oversee the shortlisting.The successful candidates are then taken through a parliamentary vetting process and approval for eventual appointment by the President."
315,Court to make ruling on Sarah Wairimu case in March,"Justice James Makau is expected to make a ruling on March 11 on whether his court has jurisdiction to hear the case filed by Sarah Wairimu - the widow of Dutch businessman Tob Cohen - seeking to drop her charges.The state has opposed the bid by Wairimu to quash the charge, urging the court to dismiss the case.The DPP and DCI argue that the case was an abuse of the court process and the court has no jurisdiction to hear the case.However, Wairimu says she was charged in order for them to take away her inheritance from the late Cohen.Wairimu was charged in 2019 but to date her trial has never commenced.Last year, she claimed the case is influenced by politicians and other actors who had been eying her matrimonial property once the health of her husband started failing.Further, she complained the police confiscated her phones without a court warrant. She said they accessed her private conversation, including privileged communication with her lawyers, breaching her right to privacy."

I appeal to police to serve me justice for losing my child in this ritualised cruel manner,"" her father said in court.Mutunga said his daughter was especially precious as she was his last born.Some of the paraphernalia found at the house include animal horns and other items.""Outside the compound was a slaughtered goat. Inside Mukira’s house was a slaughtered chicken and witchcraft items,” a police report seen by the Star reads.(Edited by V. Graham)"
318,Gethenji: Brother says ex-MP refused to withdraw case,"Former Tetu MP Ndung’u Gethenji failed to honour an agreement with his brother Fredrick Gitahi Gethenji to settle criminal cases lodged against him, a Nairobi court heard Tuesday. Gitahi told chief magistrate Martha Mutuku that Ndung’u refused to withdraw a case he had filed against the trustees of the estate – Gitahi, Ndung’u and their elder brother Robert Gethenji. They had been given seven days to settle the matter out of court. “We have had meetings as a family to try to resolve this matter. We discussed how we could settle it amicably out of court. Ndung’u asked me to remove the cases in court but he did not keep end of his bargain,” he said. The court heard that Gitahi had attempted to withdraw the cases but changed his mind after Ndung’u refused to relinquish some things to him. Gitahi was testifying against his brother, Ndung’u and eight others in a case they have been charged with creating disturbance at Kihingo Village, Kitusuru in July 2019. The suspects are Chacha Mabanga, Franklin Mutegi, Josiah Otimo, Godfrey Okello, Ochieng’ and Ouma Ogonji.

322,Egyptian woman arrested for baking 'indecent' cakes,"A woman in Egypt was briefly detained after being accused of baking ""indecent"" cakes, local media say.The cakes, topped with genitalia and underwear fashioned out of fondant icing, were eaten at a birthday party at an exclusive Cairo sports club.After photographs went viral, the baker was arrested and later released on $319 (£234) bail. She is said to have denied making the sexually suggestive icing.A top religious body warned that such baked goods were forbidden by Islam.Dar al-Ifta wrote on Facebook that products featuring sexual representations were ""an assault on the value system and a crude abuse of society"".Several women who attended the birthday party are also reportedly being investigated, while the ministry of youth and sports is looking into the involvement of the club that hosted the private gathering.Human rights lawyer Negad El Borai tweeted that the incident confirmed ""there is a segment of society, with support of the state, that wants to eliminate any space for personal freedom in Egypt under the pretext of safeguarding Egyptian family values"".He drew parallels with the cases of several young Egyptian women accused of morality-related offences in connection with videos posted on TikTok and other social media platforms.Last Tuesday, an appeals court overturned the two-year prison sentences handed to two influencers - Haneen Hossam, 20, and Mawada al-Adham, 22 - who were convicted in July of ""undermining family values and principles"" and publishing ""indecent"" photos and videos.But days later it emerged that the public prosecutor had ordered the women's continued detention pending an investigation on human trafficking charges.

323,Online hoax: Huawei not offering free new year gifts,"A hoax that could be turned into a mega scam of personal information theft is circulating with the title of mobile phone and telecom technologies company Huawei.This has been circulating on social media platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook, emails and others.A  link to an unknown website is being received by the users with the title ‘Huawei New Year Gift’ and states Huawei provides free New Year gifts.The weblink is also using the logo of the company to deceive the users easily as the majority of the consumers are unaware of such a scam.These scams mainly resulted in stealing of the individual personal information and data including phonebooks, messages, videos and pictures, and sometimes passwords of various applications including financial accounts of banks and others in the use of individuals.On clicking of the link, it leads to the users to an unknown website which is displaying ‘New Year Gift’ and stated ‘more than 100 units of computer and mobile equipment, as well as 50 cash prizes ranging from $50 to $5000.""All you have to do is open the correct gift box. You have three tries, good luck!"" it says. Then it asks three questions, starting with the questions; Do you know Huawei? Which social software do you use more often? and which Huawei product do you want to buy as a New Year gift?Whichever answer you choose you get a notification awarding you with a gift box. It asks you to open the gift box.The process involves getting three attempts to open the gift boxes; in my case, they claim that I had won a Huawei phone.Further, it asks to share the promotion with five groups/20 friends on WhatsApp, Line, or Facebook. Interestingly, it gives you 600 seconds validity to avail the chance and when one click on “continue” to receive New Year gifts, it starts stealing individual personal information and data.An official from Huawei Kenya said there was nothing from the company regarding sharing of free gifts. The hoax is globally circulated from an unknown website and the company has nothing to do with it.Further, such scams use many world-known companies' logos to deceive users. Huawei did not run any of such promotions or have any relation to the currently circulating hoax.The company has cautioned the public to be vigilant and take reasonable precautions when encountering such websites as participating in it may result in data, identity theft or other frauds.The Star thus concludes the links are nothing but a hoax.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie."
324,Trump supporter arrested after Speaker Pelosi 'data theft',"A Donald Trump supporter suspected of stealing a laptop or hard drive from Democrat Nancy Pelosi's office during the US Capitol riots has been arrested.Riley June Williams, 22, was detained in Pennsylvania on charges of violently and illegally entering the building, and disorderly conduct.A former romantic partner had said in an affidavit Ms Williams intended to sell the data to Russian intelligence.Five people died after a pro-Trump mob stormed Congress on 6 January.Ms Williams' case is among more than 200 that have been opened since the president's supporters forced their way into the Capitol building as lawmakers met to confirm Joe Biden's election win.Ms Williams was arrested on Monday in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, police records show.Ms Williams had surrendered herself to authorities, sources told CBS News.The charge sheet lists ""knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds"".It makes no mention of the data allegations. The FBI is reportedly still investigating these claims, which were carried in a sworn statement presented by an FBI agent to a court.The affidavit says Ms Williams was seen in TV footage directing crowds who stormed the Capitol.The FBI agent in the court filing says the agency was tipped off by a former romantic partner of Ms Williams who alleged she had intended to take a laptop or hard drive from the office of Ms Pelosi, the Democrat Speaker of the House of Representatives.The witness ""stated that Williams intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service"", the affidavit said.The transfer of the device ""fell through for unknown reasons"", the witness is alleged to have said, ""and Williams still has the computer device or destroyed it"".Ms Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, tweeted two days after the attack that a laptop had been stolen from the speaker's office but it was only used to give presentations.The affidavit goes on to give details of an ITV News report from inside the Capitol building at the time of the siege, in which a woman identified as Ms Williams can be seen and heard directing the crowd to go up a staircase that leads to Ms Pelosi's office.A second ITV News report some days later has an interview with Ms Williams' mother at their home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in which she confirmed her daughter was the woman in the TV footage. She said her daughter had left home without saying where she was going.Security is tight ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday amid fears of further attacks by far-right groups and others who believe President Trump's unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him."
325,Nyamira DG nominee Gesami rejected by assembly Appointments Committee,"The appointment of nominee James Gesami as deputy governor has been rejected by the Nyamira County Assembly Appointments Committee.The appointments committee presented its report to the assembly on Tuesday.Magombo ward MCA Richard Onyinkwa said there are legal issues that should be considered before they can debate the report.Among key considerations that led to the dropping of his name are that he presented an expired Certificate of good conduct.He is said to also not have presented a clearance certificate from the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM).""Following the above-stated indecencies above, the county assembly of Nyamira, has rejected the appointment of Dr James Gesami as the county's deputy governor,"" said Majority Leader Callen Atuya.However, Onyinkwa said the committee does not have the powers to reject the name.""When you state that the name has been rejected, then it means you are a god, it also means you have said the governor had no powers to appoint. The term rejection is terminal, it means the person cannot be back at any time, it is better to delete the term rejected and replace it with the term suitable,"" Onyinkwa said.The voting was conducted in the county assembly chambers on Tuesday.The vetting of Gesami was done on Friday by the select committee of the Assembly's Appointments Committee chaired by speaker Moffat Teya.After the approval of the DG nominee, the committee will then prepare a report on the suitability of the candidate.However, during Tuesday's sitting, the issue of whether the speaker had an interest in the DG position caused a stir.Ekerenyo MCA Thadeus Nyabaro had raised a question about the Teya's interest.Manga ward MCA Enock Okero countered Nyabaro saying the statement should be quashed because it was just a 'rumour'.Nominated MCA Hyline Mayaka said it should be clear whether the speaker was interested in the position and thus not chair the committee.""I also had an interest in that position and I was barred because I am married to a different county. So the speaker should not have chaired the vetting committee if he had an interest in the same position,"" Mayaka said.Bomwagamo MCA Charles Barongo demanded that speaker Teya comes out clearly and say if he was interested in the position so that he can be investigated.""Whether it was a rumour or an allegation, the speaker should come out clear on this and let us know it right here, the speaker is here,"" Barongo said.Onyinkwa said if the speaker was interested, it would not bar him from overseeing the vetting process if at all, he was sober.Speaker Teya however, denied the allegations saying he is not interested at any given time.""Honorable members, I am the speaker of the Assembly and I am chairing the Appointments Committee, I wish to confirm to the house that I am not interested, I was not interested and I will not be interested at any time for the position,"" said Teya."

327,Uhuru one step away from completing Nairobi leadership takeover,"With Nairobi having a deputy governor in office, President Uhuru Kenyatta’s plan in completing the Nairobi leadership takeover is almost finalized.An influential Jubilee MCA who sought anonymity told the Star that despite Uhuru’s silence on Nairobi leadership, he was fully aware and updated on the events.“His silence is on purposes but the President knows what he wants and needed for Nairobi people to get their services without it being dramatized,” said the MCA.Last Friday, the county witnessed Anne Kananu become the first female Deputy Governor of Nairobi after she was vetted and approved by the County assembly.On Monday, County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura who had been acting as governor, relinquished his duties for the office paving the way or Kananu to take over.However, the court on the same day gave orders blocking Kananu to be sown in as the third Governor of Nairobi County.After the formation of the assumption to office committee and if the court doesn’t interfere with the process, Kananu was to be sworn in as Nairobi's Governor and within 14 days nominate her deputy.While giving her speech, Kananu thanked the President for having trust in her as she assumes her new duties as the DG.Lawyer Danstan Omari claims that customs and traditions of governance have become a big hindrance to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga which will hinder a by-election from happening in Nairobi.He explains that all the efforts being done for Kananu to become Governor are the fear the two have in facing Deputy President William Ruto in by-elections.“ Uhuru and Raila know that If the Judiciary turns against them, they will face the Big man, they will face the Wheelbarrow champion William Ruto who will beat them in Nairobi. They cannot take that chance,” Omari added.A few hours before Mutura vacated the Governor’s office, the President castigated ex-governor Mike Sonko over his leadership.“I helped this young man get that seat. Instead of working, he was up and about doing nothing,” he said.Instead, Uhuru praised NMS boss Major General Mohammed Badi and highlighted the achievements he had done.“Just look at his (Sonko) replacement, He (Badi) has opened roads in Industrial Area, among others,” he said.The head of state has been personally inspecting projects undertaken by the Nairobi Metropolitan Service a clear sign of his support and interest in the office lead by Major General Badi.Although Uhuru has never publicly talked on recent development in Nairobi’s affairs, close individuals to the President said he was in control of the events that saw former Governor Mike Sonko impeached.The MCAs last month, went ahead and impeached the Sonko after having given a green light through a phone call from State House and a meeting held at Capital Hill, which is ODM party leader Raila Odinga’s office.Sonko on Sunday said he was jobless at the moment courtesy of President Uhuru Kenyatta.The former county boss has been in bad blood with the President since last year after he refused to assent to the County’s Appropriation Bill that would allocate Sh27.1 billion to the Nairobi Metropolitan Service.He blamed the head of state and 'State House cartels' for all his woes that eventually lead to his ouster.Lawyer Demas Kiprono however, blamed Sonko for doing 'monkey business’ with the Constitution and failing to appoint a Deputy Governor on time is what has led Nairobi into the current mess. “The Constitution relies on good faith and that everyone will do the right thing. The ideal situation is that there should be no legal vacuum at any time,"" Kiprono said.""We are in this mess because a lot of ‘monkey business’ was done by having a governor who didn’t want to follow the Constitution and failed to have a deputy for years and now he has many cases about it in court."""
328,"Second invasion: Locust swarms spreading in Northern, Central Kenya regions - FAO","Several immature swarms of locusts are arriving every day and spreading throughout parts of northern Kenya and central areas, UN-Food and Agriculture Organisation has said.The organisation's locust watch update shows that the swarms have now spread to seven counties from four last week.The locusts have been reported in Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Samburu, Laikipia, Isiolo and Meru counties.""A few swarms are starting to mature. In the southeast, hopper bands are present near Taita Taveta County and on the coast that could form swarms shortly,"" says FAO.The UN stated that conditions remain dry in some areas and the swarms are expected to disperse throughout southern Ethiopia and north-central Kenya.""Any rainfall that occurs in the coming weeks will cause swarms to mature and lay eggs. These will hatch and give rise to hopper bands during February and March,"" said FAO.The government last month said it has 321,340 litres of pesticides to control the second wave of desert locusts invasion.Agriculture PS Hamadi Boga said the pesticides include 286,040 litres at seven control bases and 35,300 litres at the main store in the Plant Protection Services Division.Boga said base managers and support personnel have already been redeployed to their respective stations.However, the PS said the second wave is likely to be more damaging.Boga said they have also deployed surveillance and control teams in the affected counties which include two surveillance helicopters and three spray aircraft."
329,FACT CHECK: Does Safaricom allow NIS to illegally forward your calls?,"A social media post claiming that telco Safaricom has allowed National Intelligence Service (NIS) to illegally forward your calls is false.The post largely forwarded on Whatsapp platforms reads “Safaricom allows NIS to illegally forward your call to 0722188188 against your right to privacy… To check if your call has been forwarded dial *#62#”Upon dialling the USSD code *#62#, it pops a message informing you that you have been enrolled to Call forwarding services.The post further instructs its readers to dial ##62# to remove forwards.On dialling ##62# the USSD code pops a message showing that you have opted out of the call notify services.Investigation on the claims shows that in a 2017 post on Twitter Safaricom notifies its customers that the number 0722188188 is for Call Notify Service while 0722199199 diverts to Voicemail.The call notify service allows subscribers to be notified by means of an SMS of people who tried to call them while they were either busy, had their phone off, or were out of coverage.The subscriber receives a message of  ‘I tried calling you, how many times and the specific time’ once he/she is available.The service is therefore not a secret security intelligence gathering technic but a call notification service.According to the company’s data privacy, your information can be disclosed to law-enforcement agencies, in response to a demand issued within the law and where the form and scope of the demand is compliant with the law.Other parties that you sign to agree to access your information are subsidiaries, associates, partners, software developers, or agents who are involved in delivering Safaricom products and services you order or use.Fraud prevention and Anti-money laundering agencies, credit reference agencies, debt collection agencies, survey agencies that conduct surveys on behalf of Safaricom, emergency service among others.The Star concludes the post is false.This story was produced by The Star in partnership with Code for Africa’s iLAB data journalism programme, with support from Deutsche Welle Akademie."

Hopefully, we will give a word to our supporters on Tuesday,” said Athman Wangara.Wangara was among hopefuls who had wanted to contest on ANC ticket but the party handed Peter Nabulindo a direct nomination.Newly formed United Democratic Alliance (UDA), which is associated with Deputy President William Ruto is reported to have asked some independent candidates in Matungu to drop their bid in favour of its candidate Alex Lanya.Paul Posho, who had hoped to contest on an ODM ticket, dropped his bid as an independent candidate and declared he would support Lanya.ODM handed former MP David Were a direct ticket.

We are going to stand together. The unity of the region is the message we are sending. What is this interest that people are looking for in this region. We will ashame them,” Mudavadi added.Mudavadi and Wetang'ula are in a deal to ensure they do not lose Matungu and Kabuchai seats.Ford Kenya will not field a candidate in the Matungu while ANC will not participate in the Kabuchai poll.Former Kenya Revenue Authority board member Evans Kakai will fly UDA's ticket for the Kabuchai seat.Wetang'ula will face a gruesome battle since Kabuchai is bordered by Ruto allied MPs who include John Waluke (Sirisia), Didmus Barasa Kimilili, Dan Wanyama (Webuye West,) Fred Kapondi (Mt Elgon) and Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula).“We have the confidence that Kakai will win the seat. I am on the ground and I know what the people of Kabuchai want,” Waluke told the Star.This will be the first time UDA is fielding candidates after it changed its name from the Party for Reforms and Development (PDR).In a bid to win allies and rally support for the Building Bridges Initiative, Jubilee Party withdrew from Matungu and Kabuchai constituencies and Machakos senatorial seat.The by-elections were occasioned by the deaths of MPs Justus Murunga (Matungu), James Lusweti (Kabuchai) and Boniface Kabaka (Machakos County)"
331,Case seeking Mwilu's removal from office set for February,"High Court Judge Said Chitembwe will preside over a bench hearing a case filed against Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu seeking her removal from office.Chitembwe is the same judge who shot to global infamy for freeing a man convicted of defiling a minor.The judge in a decision delivered in April 2016 ruled that the minor appeared willing to have sex with one Martin Charo.Chitembwe will now sit in the bench appointed to determine Mwilu’s case together with Justices Weldon Korir and Roselyne Aburili.Parties in the case appeared in court on Monday for purposes of fixing a date for highlighting their submissions.The matter will now proceed on February 18 and 19. The case will be heard for four hours non-stop.On August 14 last year, Mwilu obtained orders at the High court suspending the hearings filed before the Judicial Service Commission (JSC).The hearings are seeking her ouster. Mwilu had opposed the JSC hearing, saying two of the commissioners - Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and Macharia Njeru - are biased against her.The JSC dismissed the bias claims, so she moved to the High Court, which blocked the hearings.Chief Registrar of Judiciary and secretary of the JSC Anne Amadi has since asked the court to suspend the order stopping the JSC hearings and subsequently strikeout Mwilu’s case. Amadi says Mwilu obtained the August 14 order through non-disclosure of relevant facts that would have enabled the court to make an informed decision. There are currently four cases pending before the Commission seeking Mwilu’s ouster.But according to the documents, Mwilu has never responded to any of them despite being directed to do so on July 8 last year.  Amadi says the DCJ has failed to exhaust the dispute resolution mechanism provided in the JSC which receives and investigates complaints against judges. On the issue of striking out Paul Kihara Kariuki and Macharia Njeru from the present proceedings, Amadi says Mwilu has made allegations of bias without providing any proof. Mwilu claimed that the AG by virtue of his office is biased against her and therefore his sitting as a member of the commission in a petition for her removal would prejudice her right to fair administrative action.The allegations Amadi says are unsubstantiated and not backed by any evidence. The commission comprises 11 members among whom are Mwilu and Kihara and Macharia."

334,US envoy 'turned away' from Bobi Wine's home,"Uganda's opposition politician Bobi Wine, a pop star whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has said the US ambassador was ""turned away"" from his home by soldiers during an attempted visit.Ambassador Natalie Brown has not responded to the claim.Bobi Wine said his home remains cordoned by the military and he was not being allowed to leave.He previously said his life was being threatened following Thursday's election which saw Yoweri Museveni win a sixth elected term amid reports of election irregularities.President Museveni has denied rigging the elections but the EU, the United Nations and several rights groups have raised concerns.The US has also called for investigations into reports of irregularities in the election.Last week, Brown the United States will not observe the Uganda elections.Through a statement last Wednesday, the US Ambassador to Uganda said the cancellation had been informed by the decision by the Electoral Commission of Uganda to deny more than 75 per cent of the US election observer accreditations requested.  She said that despite multiple requests, the Electoral Commission provided no explanation for its decision, “which it communicated mere days before the elections”. Brown noted that they had complied with all Electoral Commission accreditation requirements, as they had in previous elections in Uganda. She further said that they are concerned about reports that the Electoral Commission had denied accreditation requests from members of other diplomatic missions and large numbers of Ugandan observers."

337,Fishers shun easy money to save turtles in Watamu,"Ocean turtles are endangered species, especially at the Kenyan Coast, where their meat is a delicacy. Turtle meat is believed to increase libido, especially in men.Aside from the “bedroom” shenanigans, the animal is also believed to produce oil, which has medicinal value as well its shell being used to make decorations and ornaments.Kenya’s Coast prides in being host to some turtle species, which include green turtle, hawksbill and olive ridleys.However, their numbers have dwindled due to poaching. Despite the constitution outlawing poaching or consuming of turtle meat, many fishermen deliberately go fishing for turtle due to its monetary value.Diseases and accidents from boat propellers also decimate turtles. As does infrastructural development alongside the ocean line, such as ports.To turn the tide in Watamu, residents, in partnership with an NGO, have taken up a community initiative to protect and conserve turtles and the habitat.Years ago, marine lovers would find beaches filled with shells from turtles, meaning the species had been killed and their meat taken away.A few individuals came together to start an organisation, Local Ocean Conservation (LOC), with the aim of saving and rehabilitating turtles.LOC set up a centre, which also serves as a turtle clinic, where turtles rescued are treated to recovery before they are rehabilitated back to the ocean. The clinic can hold 11 patients and can also host turtles diagnosed with cancer.As an incentive to fishers, it pays them Sh2,000 for every turtle recovery they call in.SECOND LEASE OF LIFEDuring our tour, the clinic had a turtle patient who was recovering from a back injury caused by a poacher.Pole has been at the centre for the past three months but with treatment, her situation has gotten better and she is expected to be taken back to the water soon.The centre also serves as a data collection point where turtles rescued are taken, assessed and tagged for easy monitoring.After the assessment, they are either admitted depending on their health situation or taken back to the water if they have not incurred any injury.Rajabu Katana, a fisherman, is one of the people who have chosen to save turtles instead of preying on them.Katana had just rescued a fourth turtle in a week when he called in at the turtle centre.He said they had accidentally caught the turtle while fishing but the turtle had not suffered any injuries.“This is a fourth turtle we are rescuing in two days. It is normal for us to catch these animals but because it is not intentional, we always surrender them to LOC,” he said.The fishers were educated on the need to protect the turtles. They learned that the turtles need to exist to maintain the marine ecosystem among the ocean species.Turtles are also an important source of income for Coastal residents through turtle-watching ecotourism. Sea turtle ecotourism can generate three times the income than by selling its eggs, meat and shells, making them worth more alive than dead.Katana said prior to the civic education, the animal would have landed on their plates or been sold off.“It is not about the incentives given by LOC, it is about doing the right thing. If it were about money, then I would have chosen to sell it since it would bring me more money,” he said.After examination, the crew from LOC ascertained that the turtle was fine and it was safe for it be returned back to the ocean.In return, LOC gives them some incentive to appreciate their efforts to conserve the lives of these endangered ocean species.PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITYJustin Beswick said when they started operations at LOC decades ago, even though their efforts were successful, there was still a gap in how to involve the community.After much consultation, it was evident that the organisation’s idea was not going to materialise without the help of the locals, especially fishermen.Kahindi Changawa, who has worked with LOC since 1997, said the crew would recover turtle shells lying all over the beaches.After a research, it was discovered that residents were poaching the ocean turtles, making them endangered species.“When we met the locals, they were willing to collaborate with us. However, as a way of encouraging the organisation-community partnership, we resolved to give incentives to people who rescue stranded turtles,” he said.As a result, the alliance has reduced cases of poaching as locals have turned to turtle “activists”, who go out of their way to stop any harm against them.The locals, especially fishermen, ensure they rescue turtles who are stranded or save those who are hurt by human activities, such as fishing boats.At least 150 turtles are rescued monthly. LOC is able to track the turtles using special tags, which are pinned on them when they are initially rescued.The fishers have also ventured into using safe fishing methods, which ensure turtles are not among their daily catch.They also serve as a community police for poachers, whereby they share intelligence on fishermen who poach turtles.As a result, the numbers of these ocean species have stabilised.However, turtles are losing their nesting grounds alongside the beaches as a result of Coastal development, climate change and pollution.Most of the beaches where turtles lay eggs are either being developed with infrastructure, such as ports, or are filled with trash, such as plastics bags.And as LOC works to ensure the conservation of turtles, it is evident that there are still gaps in how communities and organisations can partner to ensure success in this fight.These include lack of harmonised data on the turtles, use of technology as well as a long-lasting solution to the problem.AFRICAN MARINE PROGRAMMEIt is to bridge these gaps and bring in much-needed changes in the marine sector that the African Marine Conservation Leadership Programme was born.The project was launched by British conservation firm Blue Ventures in partnership with conservation specialists Maliasili. It aims to mould and develop a new generation of African ocean change makers.They aim to transform the capabilities of organisations working in Coastal areas by identifying needs and gaps on conservation and training participants on how to tailor-make their own solutions.The programme assesses the needs of local organisations across the targeted countries and provides training, knowledge exchanges and information sharing platforms. Participants are drawn from Kenya, Tanzania, Comoros and Somalia.The 17 leaders taking part in the nine-month programme are from organisations including Adeso, Comred (Coastal and Marine Resources Development), Dahari, and Kwetu Training Centre for Sustainable Development, Local Ocean Conservation, Mwambao, Northern Rangelands Trust and Sea Sense.Kenya’s LOC has produced three participants: Changawa, Beswick and Fiona Moejez.The programme has been an eye-opener to the participants, especially due to information and strategy sharing skills.This has made most of the organisations go back to the drawing back and realign their strategies with alternative income generation for their communities, sustainable fishing practices, ecotourism and environmental sustainability.Beswick said the programme has enabled them to think of setting up long-term solutions to some of their problems, such as coming up with alternative ways of how locals could earn more from their fishing activities while maintaining environmental standards.They plan to initiate signing of bylaws between LOC, communities, BMUs and government that will give their conservation a legal framework.“The leadership programme has given conservation a whole new angle. We plan to integrate all information we received from other participants to come up with long-term strategies,” Beswick said.With Kenya lacking concrete data on turtles, Muejes, who previously worked in Comoros, said they intend to use technology to collect data on turtles.She said conservation organisations need to work together to come up with a workable formula on how to have joint data.Edited by T Jalio"
338,Raila to chair ODM top organ over Nairobi deputy governor post,"ODM has convened a meeting of a key decision-making organ to hammer a deal on its nominee for the Nairobi deputy governor slot.The Star has established that party leader Raila Odinga will on Wednesday hold a meeting with the lean Central Management Committee—a crucial organ that has weeping powers on party decisions.This even as it emerged that there are jitters within the party over reports that Jubilee might go against a gentleman's agreement and name the deputy governor.The nomination of the city deputy governor will dominate the agenda of the Wednesday meeting. There are reports that a decision will be made on two names that are under consideration.Former Kasarani MP Elizabeth Ongoro, ODM women league chairperson Beth Siengo and party secretary-general Edwin Sifuna are among the big names being touted for the post.President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila are said to have struck a deal to create a handshake government in Nairobi after the fall of ex-county boss Mike Sonko.Anne Kananu, who was on Friday sworn in as deputy governor, on Monday took over office as acting governor from county assembly speaker Benson Mutura.She is expected to name a deputy after being sworn in as governor within the next few days, with Raila's quarters already jittery Kananu could be forced into picking a Jubilee person.This could jolt the handshake if it happened, as ODM is angling for the post as an appreciation of its goodwill for the Uhuru administration.“We are going to hold a meeting on Wednesday when the ultimate decision will be made about the ODM party's nominee for the Nairobi DG's position,” said a senior ODM official.The official, who declined to go on record on the intrigues surrounding the nomination, said the final decision had yet to be made.“There have been proposals from among members on the party's internal candidates but quite a lot will decide on who carries the day although we are aware of schemes by some people in Jubilee to front one of their own,” the official said.ODM national officials yesterday held a lengthy meeting in what was said to be a strategy session. When contacted over the unfolding intrigues, chairman John Mbadi and Sifuna said they were in a meeting.ODM politicians have maintained that once Kananu is sworn in as governor, the DG's post should be taken up by one of their members to foster the spirit of the handshake.“The DG position belongs to the handshake candidate and in my understanding that candidate comes from Nyanza,"" claimed Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo at the weekend."
339,Ruto's land grab appetite is unrivalled – Kalonzo,"Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has taken off the gloves and ganged up with ODM chief Raila Odinga in bashing William Ruto in what appears to be a well-coordinated onslaught on the Deputy President.The Nasa trio of Kalonzo, Raila and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has been firing simultaneous salvos at DP Ruto.Ruto has also been under fire from his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, with the recent one being Uhuru’s controversial suggestion of an end to the Kikuyu-Kalenjin domination of the presidency.Speaking in Nairobi on Monday, Kalonzo enumerated scandals – some involving billions of taxpayers’ money – that he claimed had Ruto’s fingerprints. The DP has denied any involvement.Kalonzo was responding to Ruto's claims that he had grabbed government land in Yatta, where he resides.But the squabble did not start here. Last week, the former Vice President said Ruto dished his entire 2013 Cabinet share to his Kalenjin community and accused him of pushing out some of Uhuru's nominees to pave way for his tribesmen.But speaking in Bomet on Friday, Ruto rubbished Kalonzo's track record and questioned how he acquired the Yatta land.According to Ruto, the Yatta parcel was government land, which the Wiper boss obtained irregularly using his influence as then vice president.“You have been an MP, minister in almost every ministry and the Vice President and the only record you have is that where you live is government land. Then you are telling us that your party’s slogan is Kazi Kazi bila Wizi [Service without stealing], I think you are confused. It should be Wizi Wizi bila Kazi [stealing without service],”  Ruto said in Bomet.But Kalonzo fought off the allegations and said he was ready to be investigated.Kalonzo, who has since been appointed South Sudan special peace envoy, termed Ruto’s claims frivolous and unsubstantiated and called on authorities to investigate every aspect of the claim.“I uphold the highest moral and ethical standards in all my affairs. I have nothing to hide and I today challenge the authorities to open an investigation into this matter,” Kalonzo said.He denied benefitting from public land, saying he will subject himself to the authorities to clear his name.""I am today presenting myself for a thorough investigation by the Directorate of Criminal Investigation as well as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission,"" he said.“I want the matter settled once and for all. Indeed, this is the time to separate the truth from lies and malicious propaganda,"" he added.The Wiper leader challenged the DP to equally offer himself for investigation concerning a record 10 scandals – the majority of them on land grabbing - which he claimed Ruto was involved.Referring to DP as ‘Arap Mashamba’, the ex-VP said Ruto’s appetite for public and private land is an open secret.Some of the scandals he wants Ruto to be investigated on include the alleged grabbing of land belonging to former Vice President Joseph Murumbi, attempted land grab of Langata Primary School playground, Weston Hotel land saga and 100 acres belonging to the late IDP Adrian Muteshi.He also cited the alleged grabbing of huge tracks of land in Taita Taveta, the Sh39 billion fake arms scandal and an incident where a businessman lost Sh300 million to people allegedly in DP’s office.“Can DP Ruto explain what he knows about the loss of billions of public funds meant for the construction of Arror and Kimwarer dams? Why was he so defensive when news of the scandal broke out? What information did he want kept out of the public’s eye concerning those collapsed projects? ” Kalonzo asked.The remarks fit into Raila’s sustained onslaught against the DP.Raila has trashed Ruto's hustler narrative and accused him of undermining the President, leading to a long list of unfulfilled Jubilee promises.At the weekend, Raila said Ruto is the reason Jubilee administration has not delivered on most of its campaign pledges. He cited laptops to primary school children, one million jobs, 47 modern stadia and 100km of tarmac road as some of the unfulfilled Jubilee promises.Mudavadi's ANC party has, on the other hand, threatened to sponsor a censure motion against Ruto when the House resumes sittings next month.In a rejoinder to Kalonzo, Ruto’s spokesman David Mugonyi  maintained the Yatta land was illegally acquired.He challenged the Wiper leader to explain to Kenyans how it changed hands from public to private.Mugonyi downplayed Kalonzo’s allegations linking Ruto to a trail of high profile land grabbing in the country.Instead, Mugonyi alleged Kalonzo has panicked over the Machakos senatorial by-election and resorted to smear campaign against Ruto.“Kalonzo does not have confidence in his candidate. In his panic, he has saddled himself with a ridiculous heap of bizarre allegations in pursuit of Deputy President William Ruto,” Mugonyi said.“He must desist from the cheap tactics of trying to salvage his political mojo by attacking the Deputy President. The Machakos contest will be won or lost on the ground.”Kalonzo also wants the DP to subject himself to lifestyle audit to explain how he obtained some of his ‘ill-gotten’ wealth.""Let us preach unity and avoid divisive politics that can plunge the country into chaos. This is our home and we do not have another country. People of DP's camp must not be given a chance to wreak havoc through wolfishly deceitful manipulations. They must be stopped in their tracks.""Kalonzo was accompanied by Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr."
340,Covid positivity rate below 5% but death toll rises,"The Covid-19 positivity has remained below five per cent for the past four days, with a rate of 2.42 per cent recorded on Monday.It was 2.14 per cent on Sunday, 2.8 on Saturday, 2.34 on Friday and 3.04 per cent on Thursday.The Health ministry on Monday confirmed that 65 more people had tested positive for the virus from a sample size of 2,681 tested in 24 hours.All the new cases were Kenyans except 16. They were aged between 12 years and 92 years. The ministry, however, warned that the curve will not be declared as having been flattened as the country had just come out of the festive season, and schools had also been reopened, hence the need to anticipate anything.For a country to declare the curve flattened, the positivity rate should be maintained at less than five per cent for at least 14 days as per the World Health Organization.The death toll continued to rise after three more patients succumbed to the disease, raising fatalities to 1,734.“Currently, there are 697 patients in health facilities countrywide, while 1,680 are in home-based isolation and care,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said in a statement.“Twenty-eight patients are in intensive care units, 13 of whom are on ventilator support and 12 on supplemental oxygen. Three are under observation.”According to the CS, another 11 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen, with 10 of them being in the general wards, while the remaining patient was in the high dependency unit.“Today, 77 patients have recovered from the disease. Sixty are from the home-based isolation and care, while 17 are from our facilities. Total recoveries now stand at 82,427.”Nairobi continued to lead in infection after registering 53 new cases. Kajiado recorded three, with Mombasa, Kitui and Uasin Gishu recording two each. Machakos, Kakamega and Murang’a each had one case.“The case in Machakos is from Kangundo, the case in Kakamega is from Lurambi and the case in Murang’a is from Kiharu,” the CS said.In Nairobi, Westlands had nine, Lang’ata eight, Dadoretti North seven and Kibra five. Kasarani, Roysambu and Starehe had three cases each; Embakasi Central, Embakasi South, Embakasi West, Kamukunji and Ruaraka had two each; while Embakasi East, Embakasi North, Makadara, Dagoretti South and Mathare recorded one case each."
341,Chaotic LSK meeting ends in suspension of eight council members,"Factional wars in the Law Society of Kenya was laid bare on Monday as passions flared, degenerating its special general meeting into a chaotic shouting match.What was intended to be an orderly gathering was reduced to heckles. Only friendly voices were allowed to speak. It all ended in the resignation of one council member, Roseline Odede, and a vote by acclamation to suspend eight members not aligned to president Nelson Havi.Also suspended was Mercy Wambua—the society's chief executive who has been at loggerheads with Havi since last year.Odede, a senior lawyer, attended the meeting virtually. She told the gathering the infighting in the LSK council had rendered it completely dysfunctional and it was emotionally draining and frustrating, hence her decision to quit.Havi announced that an election for Odede's replacement will take place on March 25.""Who else is resigning?"" Havi asked council members amid chants of ""resign"" by attendees to disgruntled members.The factions tried to outfox each other, with one led by Havi said to have travelled to the meeting to raise his numbers. Havi had told the Star last week that he was sure to remain the society's boss because he had the votes.Another group aligned to the eight council members attended mainly online. Only a few of them turned up physically.Havi's group, mainly comprising young lawyers, took charge of the meeting, shouting down any voice that was dissenting or perceived to be opposing him. Three main motions were to be considered, including the removal of Havi from the helm of the society, the appointment of an auditor to review its books and the position of chief executive Mercy Wambua.Deciding on who would vote also proved emotive, with the Havi group wanting only the side physically present to participate. They objected to the online team.""By side-lining the online team from participating, you're doing a great disservice to members and this is unacceptable,"" Carolyne Mutheu, a council member, said.The physical attendees who were pro-Havi group rammed through every proposal he brought. For example, they adopted Parker Randall, a Havi-hand-picked auditing firm, to review LSK books.A motion to eject Havi from the helm was also defeated.Maria Mbeneka, Havi's opponent in the 2020 LSK election, took her frustration to social media, saying: ""How not to conduct meetings 101 as has happened today LSK. A complete and utter shame.""She added: ""Meanwhile the real LSK SGM was in the chat group where we being asked to raise our hands; enyewe there's a new despot in town!"" She attended the meeting virtually. Lawyer Linda Bonyo also took her frustrations online, saying: ""Nelson Havi is the worst thing to ever happen to the Law Society of Kenya."" She was part of the online attendees who found it rough seeking to speak during the meeting."
342,One day in jail for calling Ranalo Foods owner 'animal' in court,"A city businessman who shot and wounded Ranalo Foods owner William Osewe in 2016 was on Monday remanded by a Nairobi court for one day after he called Osewe an animal.Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku remanded the accused Tom Oywa Mboya for using vulgar language that demeaned the court. Mboya, defending himself, used the vulgar language while being cross-examined by state prosecutor Anderson Gikunda.The court had several times warned the accused to refrain from using such language but he did not listen.""Mboya has used bad language that has violated the dignity of this court, despite warning him severally. I cannot allow a person to refer to another human being as an animal. I remand you until tomorrow morning so you can rethink about the language to be used in court and also your conduct as we proceed with this case,"" the magistrate said. When asked why he continued shooting Osewe, who was already disarmed, he said he was behaving like an ""animal"". This prompted the court to intervene following the remarks of the accused who has been found with a case to answer.In his earlier defence, Mboya confirmed to the court that he fired two shots in the air and another at Osewe's right hand, which was holding his firearm to scare him. He has further confirmed that after shooting him he did not help him but rather rushed to Kasarani police station to report the incident. Mboya said that before the shooting as he was leaving Hagon Hotel off Thika Road for lunch, he saw Osewe storm out of his car shouting, ""Uumelala na bibi yangu sana lakini leo nimekupata (You have slept with my wife many times, but I've caught you this time"").At the same time the court advised his lawyer to caution his client to stop using bad language when in court and to always respect the court.Another incident of disrespect was when Mboya picked a sweet from his pocket and started chewing it without seeking the court's permission.In September 2019 when Mboya was put on his defence, he told a court that Osewe had threatened to chop off his manhood and kill him if he didn’t stop sleeping with his wife.Mboya had admitted to shooting Osewe in self-defence. He told Mutuku that he aimed his gun at Osewe’s hands because he wanted to disarm him.“The complainant, in this case, had previously said that I had slept with his wife and he was going to cut my manhood if I don’t stop. He cocked his gun twice but could not shoot and my aim was to shoot his hands,” Mboya told the court.Mboya who was giving his defence testimony said that Osewe had threatened him even before the incident happened in 2016.Osewe, the owner of the popular Ranalo/K'osewe Foods restaurant along Kimathi Street, Nairobi, was shot on December 1, 2016. Mboya is accused of trying to kill Osewe and another man, Wilfred Ombunya Tembula. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted murder in 2017 and is out on Sh300,000 bail.In December 2016, Mboya testified that he was in Garden Estate when Osewe came shouting that he was going to kill him.“He is a loud person and he attracted the public. I tried to walk away from him. We moved to an area near a river as he followed me. I saw Osewe draw his gun, a pistol, and cock it twice, so I felt unsafe and decided to draw mine,” he said. People around them wanted to know why they were fighting. “If you cock a gun twice and try to trigger it does not shoot, it jams, that's what I was taught by the GSU,” he told the court.Mboya said he shot once at Osewe's hand and shot again twice in the air.Osewe fell down but was still holding the gun. Mboya then shot in the air again to scare him more and alert the public.“I was doing my duty as required when trying to defend yourself or disarm someone,” he said. Mboya said that he was not aware he had shot another person. And the person was not known to him. The court heard that a watchman was also shot by Mboya. But he said it would not have been possible as the watchman was up and he was down the river.“I didn't aim at him since I didn't know about him,” he said.Mboya also admitted to having reported a case in 2014 where Osewe had accused him of sleeping with his wife.“I told him I didn't know his wife and I cannot date her because I'm a married man. I even told my boss about the threats Osewe made to me,” the court heard.He also reported the matter to DCI and recorded a statement. When his lawyer asked if any step was taken by the police after the matter was reported, Mboya said Osewe’s gun was confiscated. He said his friend advised him to withdraw the case because he and Osewe were friends.“I withdrew the case in writing in February 2014,” he said.The hearing continues on Tuesday, when Mboya will be released from custody.(Edited by V.

343,"Swallow your pride and sign agreement, nurses tell governors","Nurses have told governors to swallow their pride and sign their return-to-work formula.This comes after the Council of Governors maintained that it won't be appending a signature to the formula arrived at more than two weeks ago.In what now appears to be a show of might, the nurses have vowed not to report to work until the document is fully signed.""We want to ask governors for the last time that they should swallow their pride and come and sign the return-to-work agreement. Without that, we are not going to bow to any pressure, any intimidation, or any sacking,” the nurses said.With their strike entering 44th day on Tuesday, the nurses have hit back at the CoG over claims that they get 16 allowances.The union has further accused the council chairman Wycliffe Oparanya of peddling lies with regard to the ongoing strike, saying nurses are entitled to only four allowances.The nurses arrived at a conclusion on all the grievances they had raised, but the document has been gathering dust at the labour offices. The CoG has refused to append their signature on the grounds that it was not consulted.""As a union, we are ready to meet with the Council of Governors anytime, anywhere. Even if it is on the moon, we are ready to travel; even if it is on the sun, we are ready to go at night and have the meeting there if that is what the Council of Governors wants,” KNUN secretary general Seth Panyako said.“But there will be no going back without our issues being addressed, without commitment by the two levels of government to compensate families who have lost nurses to Covid-19, and commitment to refund money spent by nurses during their treatment when they were sick.” The governors last week said nurses are some of the best paid civil servants in the counties and do not deserve any more raise, adding that that is untenable and will distort counties' payrolls.“It is wrong for the governor to say we are getting 16 allowances. I am a senior nurse and I am getting three allowances, three of which are allowances that are common to almost every public servant. The only special allowance I am getting is the nursing service allowance,” KNUN national chairman Maurice Opetu said.They have accused the CoG of frustrating efforts made by the Health CS, the Labour CS and the multi-agency committee formed to help address the stalemate.Panyako also warned Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua against threatening striking nurses with show-cause letters, adding he will stop at nothing to ensure no nurse is sacked.“We want to tell the governors that this is not going to stop us from demanding risk allowance, which we are supposed to get and is our right. Where did the Kakamega governor come up with the 16 allowances he is talking about unless he is mistaking us for governors,” he said.The nurses have been on strike alongside clinical officers and lab technologists over demand for standard and adequate personal protective equipment, risk allowance for the frontline health workers, delayed salaries and employment of more staff, among other grievances.“It is very clear that the people who are making Kenyans suffer, die and not get their health services are not any other person but the governors that they elected. From today, any single life lost should be on the heads of the governors,” Opetu said.Clinical officers on Sunday took a similar stand, saying they won’t go back to work until their demands are fully met."
344,Serbia weathers Covid to top Europe in growth,"Despite harsh Covid-19 economic effects, Serbia appears to have weathered the storm to emerge tops in Europe in economic growth.Serbia President Aleksandar Vucic announced the country had a growth of 5.2 per cent in the first quarter, compared to the Eurozone rate of minus 3.2 per cent.“In the second quarter, Serbia had a growth of minus 6.3 per cent, while the Eurozone was at minus 14.7 per cent, and in the third quarter, when the Eurozone was at minus 4.3 per cent, Serbia's figure was only minus 1.4 per cent,” President Vucic said in a statement shared with the country’s foreign missions.He said Montenegro recorded minus 26 per cent minus in the third quarter. Vucic said this was possible owing to the economic reforms the government has made since 2014 — when he was the premier— and the rapid reopening of the country after the first wave of coronavirus. He said the reforms made it possible to mitigate the effects of the pandemic by buying respirators, masks, gloves, protective suits, medicine, building and refurbishing hospitals.""These are unprecedented results for Serbia. Was Serbia ever before the first in Europe in terms of growth rate? We will get the results on March 31 that will confirm that Serbia is number one in Europe. All that was possible thanks to people who believed in difficult changes,"" Vucic said. Global Risk Insights 2020 publication said the growth was due to structural factors such as a less dependence on tourism and effective fiscal and monetary responses, which significantly alleviated contractionary pressures.The 2014 austerity measures, which were considered unpopular, enforced a 10 per cent pay cut on all civil servants and pensioners.Serbian Ambassador to Kenya Dragan Županjevac said the move stabilised the country’s economy and its currency, at some point stronger than the Euro.""We were also able to reduce unemployment, increase foreign direct investments; the growth rate is still high. These were strong fiscal measures,” Županjevac said at his embassy in Nairobi on Monday.President Vucic said last year, Serbia had a net inflow of foreign direct investment amounting to €2.9 billion (Sh385 billion) and €3 billion gross, which means “many foreign companies such as Toyota Tires, Boysen, ZTF and Brose have invested in Serbia even in the year of crisis”. While other states are redirecting infrastructure budgets to Covid-19 response, Vucic said they will this year be able to build as many as six highways. And with the economic growth, the wages are now rising.Vucic said Serbia now has the highest average wages in the region, amounting to €511 or and that in February, due to the January increase, the average wage will be €535 or €536.Employment is increasing  n Serbia and the public debt has increased by less than in most European states.In Italy the public debt surged to 156 per cent, in Germany to 87 per cent, in France to 114 per cent, in Croatia to 88 per cent, compared to Serbia’s 57 per cent. COVID-19 RESPONSEThe President rejected claims about bad results of Serbia in the fight against Covid-19, saying the country has recorded the lowest mortality rate in the region. On January 13, Euronews reported that while Serbia’s total death toll from the pandemic is relatively low, around 3,600, its rate of fatalities in the medical profession is far higher than in other nations.The report said critics blame the state of the country’s healthcare system since a 2013 hiring freeze on public sector workers, which includes doctors and nurses.But the Serbian leader said the country has done better compared to the region.""The mortality rate in the region is as follows: Bulgaria 3.9, Bosnia and Herzegovina 3.7, Hungary 3.11, North Macedonia 3.03, Romania 2.48. Slovenia 2.15, Croatia 1.99, Montenegro 1.4, and Serbia 1.0. This can be seen in the graphs and is no fabrication,"" he said.Vucic said he hopes 2021 will be better than 2020 and that the virus will be defeated through vaccination.(Edited by V. Graham)"
345,"Maize up by Sh200, upper limit Sh2,700 so far","The National Cereals and Produce Board on Monday increased maize purchase prices by Sh200.Joseph Kimote, NCPB managing director, said they have reviewed the buying price for a 90kg bag to Sh2,700 from Sh2,500.Speaking to the Star on Monday Kimote said the decision to increase the prices was due to the market dynamics as traders and millers are buying maize at between Sh2,650 and Sh2,700 per bag.  “The issue was to be at par with what the market is offering. The government directive was to ensure minimum maize purchasing prices remain at Sh2,500. We can still go up and we have that flexibility.  We wanted to align to what the market wants,” he said.He said the uptake for farmers to deliver maize to the board has been slow because others are buying at a better price.“Sh100 makes a big difference and we want to offer farmers a better price,” he said.He assured farmers payment will be prompt and made within 24 hours  of delivery.Kipkorir Menjo, chairman of Kenya Farmers Association, said prices of maize being offered by the market are good as long as there is no interference with imports during harvesting time.He said counties should strengthen the cooperatives especially those dealing with cereals so that they can pool their resources.Menjo said many farmers operate on a small-scale and have a lot of financial needs, hence, may not be able to store until prices are high.“Many are forced by their needs to dispose immediately they harvest, but if they are under cooperatives they can have a bargaining power, and to store their maize and sell at an appropriate time. They can also offer services of warehouse receipt,” he said.Timothy Njagi, a senior researcher from Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development said Njagi said 2020-2021 maize production will be good owing to the favourable long and short seasons.“We are likely to get an estimated 39 million bags of maize for the long rains season and another three to four million bags for the short rains,"" he said.(Edited by V.

346,"Dynasty, hustler narrative, a recipe for anarchy — Wambugu says","Classifying Kenyans as either belonging to dynasties or a hustlers' movement is extremely dangerous, Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu has said. Wambugu told journalists at his Nyeri office that he supports President Uhuru Kenyatta's remarks that the groupings were a recipe for chaos. The president spoke with Kikuyu radio stations on Monday.  “The narratives must be fought by all means as the President said. I fully associate myself with his sentiments as it captures all that some of us have been propagating especially in rallying our people against certain political discourse‚” Wambugu said.The MP also expressed fears that the narrative will lead to attacks on properties of those perceived to be doing well in society.This is despite the fact that their assets are a result of hard work and sacrifices, he said.Wambugu said he was glad that even some clergy have condemned the narrative and have been urging their followers to avoid it.“The manner the dynasty-hustler debate is being carried out creates the sad element of us versus them that our opponents have for long pretended to fight in their opposition to the BBI,” the legislator said. “It is ironical that they claim to oppose the BBI on claims that it seeks to present us versus them case when they are doing the same with the dangerous talk of hustler versus dynasty. We rebuke these divisive politics and as the President urged our people against being blinded by a politician driven by personal and selfish desire,” he said.The lawmaker lauded the President for coming out clearly and disassociating BBI with the 2022 politics.“It is good that the President has clarified that we are not yet in the campaign stage for BBI, we are still at signature verification. Those saying the document is not popular in Kenya should wait till we get at the stage of campaigning for it. They will be shocked and embarrassed with their statistics.” This, he said, is what he has been arguing adding that is why he has never lobbied for anyone's 2022 candidature in his support for the BBI.Like the President, he urged residents to consider the larger benefits of BBI to the region and support it.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
347,"Resettle Dundori Forest evictees, senators order Lands ministry","Senators have ordered the Ministry of Lands and the Nakuru government to resettle thousands of families that were evicted from Dundori Forest.The Lands, Environment and Natural Resources Committee also directed the National Land Commission to investigate the circumstances under which the families were forcibly ejected from the forest, which they call their ancestral land.“The committee recommends that the NLC expedite its investigation into the claim by the petitioners as a historical injustice and submits a report to the committee and the Ministry of Lands within three months,” reads a report by the panel.The committee chaired by Mwangi Githiomi (Nyandarua) made the recommendations after probing the evictions following a petition by the victims. Dundori is a block within Bihari Forest in Nakuru county.In addition, the panel, whose report was adopted by the House, recommended that the evictees receive relief food accorded to internally displaced persons by the Ministry of Devolution.The families claimed the government evicted them from the forest in 1988, despite living on the parcel since 1930. They alleged that some unknown people suddenly occupied a 200-acre piece where they were supposed to be resettled – leaving them landless and paupers.“Presently, the former residents of Dundori Forest are scattered all over Narok county, and that most of them, their only source of livelihood is serving as casual labourers due to lack of land to cultivate and earn a living,” the report says.In its submission, the NLC told the committee during its enquiry that resettlement is a function of the Ministry of Lands.The Ministry, on the other hand, said while the government’s previous policy was to have those employed to tend to trees to reside in forest houses provided by the government, the arrangement was changed in 1988.“This, therefore, meant that the labourers had to vacate the forest houses and this should not be interpreted to mean evictions,” it said in its submission to the committee."
348,Reprieve for tea farmers after court stops additional levy,"Tea farmers on Monday got a temporary reprieve after a judge stopped the state from demanding an additional levy.High Court Judge Anthony Mrima gave a temporary order pending determination of a case filed by Kenya Tea Growers Association challenging some sections of recently passed Tea Act.Also granted by the judge is an order suspending the implementation of the law being challenged.The association is challenging Sections 36, 48 and 53 of the Tea Act 2020 on grounds that they were illegally inserted by Parliament without considering the plight of tea farmers.They say the section is in contravention of the Constitution because the application of a tea levy on exports and curtailment of direct sales is discriminatory.The court was told that introduction of the tea levy violates the rights of the farmers and puts them at a distinct disadvantage with respect to their counterparts in the East African Community market at the tea auction.The association is also challenging a law allowing the exclusive sale of tea processed and manufactured in the country for the export market on the auction floor.The association is also challenging a law allowing the exclusive sale of tea processed and manufactured in the country for the export market on the auction floor.They are challenging Section 36 of the Tea Act. This, however, does not affect orthodox and specialty teas.The association says its members have various direct contracts with tea buyers from Central Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Europe and Asia.They say their contracts are for specific qualities and quantities for 2021 up to 2023.Many of the direct contracts are in respect of customised categories of teas which are not sold through the auction and which have been certified by different agencies such as Rainforest, Fair trade and Ethical Tea Partnership.These teas fetch a higher premium overseas.The implementation of the law in question will result in the association members being unable to fulfil their contractual obligations.They will lose the financial benefit of the direct/forward contracts which offer better and higher returns than auction prices.In addition, implementation of the law will give a competitive edge to other countries in the region that will be able to continue selling their teas directly.The case will come up for hearing on February 22.Edited by Henry Makori"
349,Rangers blame authorities for secrecy and mistrust in stimulus package,"President Uhuru Kenyatta's bid to cushion community rangers in private and community conservancies from Covid-19 effects has been marred by secrecy and mistrust.Rangers who separately talked with the Star said the programme is shrouded in secrecy.A ranger working at a conservancy bordering Tsavo West National Park said the wait has been long.""We gave our details but they were brought back, with authorities saying we needed to confirm them. We have confirmed but nothing is forthcoming,"" the ranger who sought anonymity said.The situation is replicated in conservancies in Taita Taveta.A ranger in a conservancy in Lamu also decried the wait.""We are just surviving hoping authorities will pay us soon,"" he anonymously said, fearing reprisal.President Kenyatta unveiled a Sh53.7 billion eight-point economic stimulus package to alleviate the effects of coronavirus pandemic on the economy on May 23, 2020.In the package, the tourism and wildlife sector received Sh5 billion to provide soft loans for the refurbishment of the tourism facilities through the Tourism Finance Corporation.It also received Sh1 billion for 5,500 wildlife scouts under Kenya Wildlife Service and Sh1 billion for the 160 wildlife conservancies in the country.In July last year, Tourism CS Najib Balala announced that Sh1 billion will be used to pay salaries of 3,500 community rangers in private and community conservancies.Balala said the government had allocated the amount to support rangers working outside KWS to mitigate the economic impacts of the pandemic.“The money will go towards paying salaries for rangers in 160 conservancies that is outside KWS managed parks and game reserves. We are targeting 3,500 rangers whose salaries will be paid for one year,” Balala said.The CS said the rangers would be supported in salaries for the next one year because the pandemic has depleted private conservancies’ revenues due to a lack of tourism.National parks and game reserves receive funding from the government to support operations unlike conservancies that rely on tourism.Since the pandemic broke out, the majority of the camps in conservancies have closed and staff have gone on unpaid leave uncertain of their jobs as investors work to survive an estimated loss of between $217 million and $392 million.Due to lack of funds, the Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association started working with the Ministry of Tourism and KWS to develop the disbursement procedure, accountability requirements and reporting on the support fund.KWCA embarked on collecting information from conservancy rangers for enlisting to benefit from the one-year programme.The ministry directly disbursed the funds to conservancy rangers.The conservancies were provided with a guide that provided a brief on the funds and disbursement measures.On December 22, 2020, KWCA boss Dickson Kaelo wrote to members, saying the association could not share the update earlier due to ""the sensitivity and complexity of government procedures.""""We are pleased that about 2,850 rangers have already received their part salaries through rangers' bank account and M-Pesa.""A total of Sh18,000 was allocated per ranger with a net pay of Sh17,200 disbursed by KWS. Statutory deductions of Sh800, NHIF (Sh500) and NSSF (Sh300). KWS will request conservancy managers to share NHIF/NSSF numbers to remit deductions,"" Kaelo said.Kaelo said about 100 rangers had their salaries bounce due to inactive accounts and errors in account numbers.Some 550 rangers could not be paid due to absence of bank accounts, accounts with Saccos, among other reasons.Kaelo said verification was ongoing to sort out the errors and communication is on the way to respective conservancies to counter check bank details.He asked conservancies to be patient saying they expect a smooth process on future payments.Tourism PS Fred Segor neither picked our calls nor responded to our text messages on the matter.Kaelo said the ministry allocated Sh800 million towards rangers salaries and operation costs and Sh200 million for National Wildlife Trust Fund.He said the Trust will be designed to provide sustainable finance to conservancies during and post Covid-19 recovery.Kaelo said a list of 4,019 conservancy rangers were submitted to the association by 154 conservancies, exceeding the approved 3,500 rangers."
350,High Court stops swearing in of Kananu as Nairobi governor,"The High Court on Monday stopped the swearing in of Anne Kananu as Nairobi governor following a suit by the Law Society of Kenya.Judge Anthony Mrima directed that the LSK case be heard next Thursday by a bench to be constituted by acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu.The LSK also sought an order to suspend Kananu's swearing in into the office of deputy governor, which happened last Friday.Through lawyer Peter Wanyama the LSK said the hurried swearing of Kananu to office is illegal and a brazen attempt to undermine the process of a by-election as required by the Constitution.The office of Nairobi governor became vacant after previous holder Mike Mbuvi Sonko was impeached. Nairobi assembly speaker Benson Mutura was appointed the acting governor.Nairobi County has been without a deputy governor since January 11, 2018 when Polycarp Igathe resigned from the position. After the resignation, former governor Sonko nominated Miguna Miguna for vetting by the county assembly. However, the county assembly rejected the name.Thereafter, Kananu was nominated to the position of deputy governor but the vetting was not done in good time.And on December 18, 2020 the governor’s office became vacant after Sonko was impeached.Subsequently, Speaker Mutura was sworn in on December 21, 2020 as acting governor for a period of 60 days pending the election of a governor and deputy governor.But last Friday, Kananu was sworn in as deputy governor after approval by the county assembly.LSK says that the swearing in is unconstitutional because at the time when the office of governor became vacant, there was no deputy governor to assume office for the remainder of the term as required by the Constitution.""The state by its action appears to be suggesting that the earlier nomination of Kananu before the vacancy occurred creates legal rights that can be revived and completed even after a vacancy has occurred in the office of governor,"" the court heard.However, the LSK holds that the uncompleted process of vetting of Kananu cannot be revived because it will create legal absurdities.“In addition, these consequential acts will deeply undermine the constitutional objectives of a by- election that article 182 (5) of the constitution of Kenya curves out,” LSK says."
351,Form 4 candidate disappears on her way to school,"A family in Nairobi is searching for their daughter who disappeared on her way to school in Makueni on January 4.Leah Atieno, a Form 4 candidate at St Stephen ACK Kima in Makueni county, never reported to school after she boarded a matatu at Cabanas stage along Mombasa Road.Speaking to the Star on the phone, her mother Josephine Mwende said her daughter took a matatu at Masimba stage in Kayole, Nairobi on January 4, morning accompanied by her younger brother.They both took a matatu to Cabanas where she parted ways with the brother after she boarded a matatu headed to the school. “My daughter got lost on her way to school. I left the house with her while going to work together with her younger brother.  The brother accompanied her to Cabanas where she reportedly boarded the vehicle,” Mwende said.She said the school’s matron informed her that her daughter had not reported to school last Friday. Mwende said attempts to find her daughter had not borne fruit even after she enquired her whereabouts from the girls’ close friends.“My daughter had a phone when she was at home before the schools reopened. I thought she had left it in the house but I have searched everywhere and not found it,” Mwende said.She said Atieno was last seen on WhatsApp the same morning at around 8am while she was still in the house. Her cellphone line has since been switched off.Mwende said the girl had been chatting with some of her school friends that morning before she left for school.She is now calling on anyone who has come across the girl to report to the nearest police station.The matter was reported to Soweto police station in Nairobi via OB NO 16/16/1/2021 at 1025 hours. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
352,"County cash crisis deepens, CoG threatens shutdown","The cash crisis is deepening across the 47 counties and the Council of Governors says operations may grind to a halt.Some counties have not paid their employees for months, others have been forced to take loans to meet their expenses.Some have stopped development projects so they can pay salaries and wages.“The delay in disbursement of funds has negatively affected the lives of county government civil servants and service delivery,” Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said in a statement.The Kakamega governor disclosed that development has stalled as the counties cannot pay contractors due to lack of funds.Covid-19 intervention measures have been hampered, health facilities have run out of essential supplies even as health workers' strikes continue to take a heavy toll on patients.The council has already threatened to shut down counties and take legal action to push the Treasury to disburse the cash.Kenya County Government Workers Union secretary-general Roba Duba said some counties have not paid their workers for months.“We are experiencing a problem. Our members have not been paid,” Duba told the Star.Duba said payment of salaries has been a problem long before the Covid-19 pandemic. The virus 'only aggravated' workers' woes, he said.The county governments have not received their Exchequer releases for at least three months, owing to the delays by the National Treasury. Oparanya places the total outstanding figure at Sh89.6 billion – meant for November, December and January.“We urge the National Treasury to expedite the release of the equitable share to county government by the 15th of every month as the law clearly stipulates. The counties need to pay salaries to the county civil servants and to provide services to wananchi,” Oparanya said.Last week, Treasury CS Ukur Yatani admitted delays in disbursement of the cash to the devolved units, saying the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on revenue collection.""Due to the adverse effects of Covid-19 and the subsequent containment measures that have slowed down economic activities, the disbursements to county governments are falling behind by two months,” he said.Yatani expressed optimism that the balance will be disbursed 'in due course' with the opening up of the economy and the reversal of the tax relief measures.“The Treasury expects revenue collection to improve from the current quarter and will prioritise disbursements to county governments with a view to clearing the arrears,” he said.(Edited by V.

353,Wajakoya testifies in Gethenji assault case,"An advocate on Monday identified the assailants who assaulted him in a case in which former Tetu MP Ndung’u Gethenji is facing charges of creating a disturbance.George Wajakoya was able to identify five of the men charged alongside Ndung’u.He told the court the assault occurred at Kihingo village in 2019.Wajakoya in his testimony said he was visiting his client Fredrick Gitahi Gethenji to get instructions regarding a case.But his statement, which was read out in court, indicated that, ""Today around 130pm I received a call from Gitahi to witness the entry of goons in the compound. I was in Westlands area when Gitahi called.""Asked whether he was armed, Wajakoya said, “No”.  Wajakoya before becoming an advocate was once a police officer, grave digger and hustler at some point in his life.He also admitted to fleeing the country following the killing of Robert Ouko. He was a person of interest in the murder case.“I went there to see what was going on. I did not engage the goons at Kihingo estate. I did not go to fight,” he said.According to a P3 form produced in court, Wajakoya alleges to have been assaulted by persons well known to him. But on Monday he said the information in the form was incorrect.The form also indicated that his clothes had no tear or any blood stains.And as the defence counsels prodded him further, Wajakoya asked the court to protect him. But his advocate interjected and asked the court to stand down Wajakoya for further instructions.And in a bizarre manner, Wajakoya on that account fired his advocate while he was on the stand. “What further instructions are you talking about? You are fired!” he said.He accused his advocate of not defending him while he was being cross-examined.Wajakoya 61, further denied calling the Flying Squad on the date the goons were spotted at Kihingo.He said he only called DCIO Gigiri and that the OCS Gigiri also came but he did not attend to him.The court further heard that Wajakoya was not called to any identification parade convened by the police in relation to the case. The matter proceeds on Tuesday.In the case, James Ndungu Gethenji (former Tetu MP), Chacha Mabanga, Franklin Mutegi, Josiah Otimo, Godfrey Okello, Ochieng and Ouma Ogonji are accused of creating a disturbance on July 2, 2019 at Kihingo village in Kitusuru, Nairobi county. They are said to have interfered and stopped the renovation of a house belonging to Dhanji.Mutegi, Otimo, Okello, Ochieng' and Ouma are also accused of assaulting Wajakoya and Kumar Dhanji, occasioning them bodily harm."
354,Foul-mouthed trader who shot Ranalo Foods owner over wife dispute detained,"A city businessman who shot at Ranalo Foods restaurant owner William Osewe in 2016 was on Monday remanded by a Naiorbi court for one day after he referred to Osewe as an animal.Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku remanded the accused Tom Oywa Mboya for using vulgar language which demeaned the court. Mboya used the vulgar language while being cross examined by state prosecutor Anderson Gikunda while defending himself in the case.The court had severally warned the accused to refrain from using such language but he did not listen.""Mboya has used bad language that has violated the dignity of this court despite warning him severally. I cannot allow a person to refer to another human being as an animal. I remand you until tomorrow morning so that you can rethink about the language to be used in court and also your conduct as we proceed with this case,"" the magistrate said. When asked why he continued shooting Osewe who was already disarmed, he said that the Osewe was behaving like an animal. This prompted the court to intervene following the remarks of the accused who has since been found with a case to answer.In his earlier defence, Mboya confirmed to the court that he fired two shots in the air and another at Osewe's right hand which was holding his firearm to scare him. He has further confirmed that after shooting him he did not help him but rather rushed to Kasarani police station to report the incident. Mboya said that before the shooting as he was leaving Hagon hotel off Thika Road for lunch, he saw Osewe storm out of his car got shouting, ""Uumelala na bibi yangu sana lakini leo nimekupata (You have slept with my wife many times, but I've caught you this time).""At the same time the court advised his lawyer to caution his client to stop using bad language when in court and should always respect the court.Another incident where the court witnessed disrespect was when Mboya picked a sweet from his pocket and started chewing without seeking the court's permission.In September 2019 when Mboya was put on his defence, he told a court that Osewe had threatened to chop off his manhood and kill him if he didn’t stop sleeping with his wife.Mboya had admitted to shooting Osewe in self-defence. He told Mutuku that he aimed his gun at Osewe’s hands because he wanted to disarm him.“The complainant, in this case, had previously said that I had slept with his wife and he was going to cut my manhood if I don’t stop. He cocked his gun twice but could not shoot and my aim was to shoot his hands,” Mboya told the court.Mboya who was giving his defence testimony said that Osewe had threatened him even before the incident happened in 2016.Osewe, the owner of the popular Ranalo/K'osewe Foods restaurant along Kimathi Street, Nairobi, was shot on December 1, 2016. Mboya is accused of trying to kill Osewe and another man, Wilfred Ombunya Tembula. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted murder in 2017 and is out on Sh300,000 bail.In December 2016, Mboya testified that he was in Garden Estate when Osewe came shouting that he was going to kill him.“He is a loud person and he attracted the public. I tried to walk away from him. We moved to an area near a river as he followed me. I saw Osewe draw his gun, a pistol and cock it twice, so I felt unsafe and decided to draw mine,” he said. There were people around them who wanted to know why they were fighting. “If you cock a gun twice and try to trigger it does not shoot, it jams, that's what I was taught by the GSU,” he told the court.Mboya said he shot once at Osewe's hand and shot again twice in the air.Osewe fell down but was still holding the gun. Mboya then shot in the air again to scare him more and alert the public.“I was doing my duty as required when trying to defend yourself or disarm someone,” he said. Mboya said that he was not aware he had shot another person. And the person was not known to him. The court heard that a watchman was also shot by Mboya. But he said it would not have been possible as the watchman was up and he was down the river.“I didn't aim at him since I didn't know about him,” he said.Mboya also admitted to having reported a case in 2014 where Osewe had accused him of sleeping with his wife.“I told him I didn't know his wife and I cannot date her because I'm a married man. I even told my boss about the threats Osewe made to me,” the court heard.He also reported the matter to DCI and recorded a statement. When his lawyer asked if any step was taken by the police after the matter was reported, Mboya said Osewe’s gun was confiscated. He said his friend advised him to withdraw the case because he and Osewe were friends.“I withdrew the case in writing in February 2014,” he said.The hearing continues on Tuesday, when Mboya will be released from custody."
355,You didn't make me Nairobi governor: Sonko hits back at Uhuru,"The bad blood between President Uhuru Kenyatta and impeached Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has hit a new high after the latter disputed receiving any help to clinch the county's top seat. During an interview with Kikuyu radio stations aired on Monday, Uhuru said he had helped the former governor clinch the key seat but he ended up being “up and about doing nothing”.The stations which aired the interview were Gukena, Kameme and Inooro.Uhuru claimed that he initiated the removal of Sonko as Nairobi governor as his leadership style nearly grounded services in city.But in a long and strong-worded statement on Monday, Sonko hit back saying that Uhuru was telling lies.""For the record, it is not Uhuru Kenyatta who made me the Governor of Nairobi. I was validly elected by close to one million residents of Nairobi,"" he said.""...garnering more votes than the President himself, and Governors are not Presidential appointees.Sonko garnered 871,794 votes in 2017, while Uhuru garnered 779,299 votes in Nairobi during the repeat presidential poll.Sonko resorted to highlighting all the projects he did during his tenure in office.He noted that within a few days after assuming office, he cracked down on the cartels that had held Nairobi hostage for decades, sealed all the looting avenues by digitizing revenue collection among others.""It is therefore ridiculous for the President to allude to failure of any administration, yet he has presided over the worst administration in the history of Kenya,"" he said.He urged the President to own up to Kenyans that he has been 'incompetent and incapable' of running the country.Uhuru and Sonko were once bosom buddies but fell out last year leading to the former City Hall boss’ unceremonious removal from office in December. Anne Kananu was sworn-in as Nairobi's deputy governor on Friday last week, and on Monday, she took over the role of governor in an acting capacity after Speaker Benson Mutura handed over.Furniture, flags and tables were moved from across the Nairobi county assembly to KICC on Friday afternoon for Kananu's swearing-in following her approval by the Appointments committee.During her vetting, Kananu pledged to have a seamless working relationship with Nairobi Metropolitan Service to enable services to be delivered to residents.This is in contrast to impeached Sonko, whose acrimonious relationship with the NMS, among other foibles, led to his removal."
356,Kenya records 65 new Covid-19 cases as 77 recover,"Kenya on Monday recorded 65 new Covid-19 cases, from a sample of 2,681 tested in the last 24 hours, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said in a statement.This now brings the total number of cases to 99,227, with the cumulative tests in the country standing at 1,128,360.Of these cases, 49 are Kenyans and 16 are foreign with 39 being males and 26 females.In terms of the age, the youngest is a 12-year-old child while the oldest is 92.The country has witnessed 77 patients who have recovered from the disease, with 60 from the home based care program while 17 are from various health facilities.This now brings the total number of recoveries in the country to 82,427.Sadly, Kenya has lost three more patients to the virus, raising the total number of fatalities to 1,734.Currently, there are 697 patients admitted in various health facilities countrywide, while 1,680 are on home based isolation and care.28 patients are in ICU, 13 of whom are on ventilatory support and 12 on supplemental oxygen.

357,Internet restored in Uganda but not social media,"The internet shutdown in Uganda that had entered its fifth day on Monday has ended.Social media is however still blocked and only accessible through VPN, the BBC's Patience Atuhaire says.The internet was shut down on Wednesday night with just hours to go before polling stations opened for Thursday's general elections.This was shortly after Facebook apparently suspended hundreds of pro-government Ugandan accounts.President Yoweri Museveni while commenting about Facebook's decision said there was no way anyone would come to Uganda and decide what was good or bad.Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda told NBS television that the government was reviewing the security situation before restoring the internet."
358,Surging rape cases among teens is worrying- Sonia Birdi,"Former nominated member of parliament Sonia Birdi has expressed concern over the high rate of rape cases among the teenagers in the country by their relatives.Speaking to journalists in a Nairobi hotel, Sonia said it's quite unfortunate that many young girls are leaving schools due to pregnancy with no place to have a shelter.""Since Covid-19 broke out last year, a number of young girls have been impregnated by friends or relatives and are left with no place to go,"" said SoniaThe vocal politician is now calling for the government and well-wishers to come up with structures where young girls who do not have a place to live can be accommodated even as they wait to be taken back to schools.She also lauded the government for taking actions against the perpetrators of this act including the man who was sentenced to 170 years for defiling her own two girls.""I think the government needs to do a lot in terms of law to protect girls by enact turf laws because I feel much more needs to be done.""Sonia's sentiments come barely one week after a 45-year-old man was sentenced to 140 years in prison by a Baricho Court after he pleaded guilty to defiling his two daughters in Ndia, Kirinyaga County.John Gichira Gichini pleaded guilty to two counts of defiling and impregnating his step daughters."
359,Global tea surplus pushes down prices - KTDA,"The volume of green leaf produced by smallholder tea farmers under the Kenya Tea Development Agency management dropped marginally by 0.7 per cent.During the last six months ending December 2020, 615 million kgs were produced compared to 619.5 million kgs recorded during the same period in 2019.During the period under review, the average price per kilo of KTDA teas at the Mombasa Tea Auction dropped significantly by 14 per cent to USD 2.18 from USD 2.54 recorded in the same period in 2019.This is the third year in a row that prices have declined due to a global supply surplus above the market demand and in line with a 2018 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) market forecast.Despite the slight drop in production, the drop in tea prices is attributed to the high volumes of tea that continue to be delivered to the auction from the region, in addition to the global oversupply of tea.“High volumes of tea produced in the East African region and elsewhere on the globe have contributed to the continued price decline in the global market,” KTDA Management Services Managing Director, Alfred Njagi, said.The high tea production in Kenya is majorly a result of favourable weather conditions during the period, besides the rapid expansion of acreage under tea over the years.In the last financial year (2019/2020), smallholder farmers under KTDA produced 1.454 billion kilograms of green leaf, up from 1.13 billion kilograms the previous year (2018/2019). This represents a 28.7 per cent increase in production.Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (2020) also shows that smallholder farmers across the country, including those delivering to KTDA managed factories, have been increasing acreage under tea.‘‘The impact on tea prices of the commencement of the Tea Act 2020 that requires all black tea exports processed and manufactured in Kenya to be sold exclusively at the tea auction floor will soon be realized” Njagi said.He added, “We are waiting to see the full effects of the new law to the industry in the coming months.”In 2019, the world produced 6.1 million kgs of made tea during which time consumption stood at 5.86 million kgs, spilling an excess of 290 million kgs of tea that continues to crush the markets.“To improve tea prices for the smallholder tea farmers, the Kenyan Government through the newly created Tea Board, needs to assist grow the African market for Kenyan teas by courting some of the West and North African countries such as Morocco, Nigeria and also markets in other continents that are importing tea from outside Africam,” Njagi said."
360,Court stops state from demanding additional levies from tea farmers,"A judge has stopped the state from demanding additional levy from tea farmers.High Court Judge Anthony Mrima on Monday gave a temporary order pending determination of a case filed by Kenya Tea Growers Association challenging some sections of recently passed Tea Act.The association is challenging Sections 36, 48 and 53 of the Tea Act 2020 on grounds that they were illegally inserted by Parliament without considering the plight of tea farmers.The law being challenged allows the exclusive sale of tea at the tea auction and imposes additional levies.The court was told that the introduction of the tea levy violates the rights of the farmers, and it puts them at a distinct disadvantage with respect to their counterparts in the East African Community market at the tea auction.The farmers claim the said provisions will increase taxes and drive them out of business.The association, which has brought the case to court, says its members have various direct contracts with tea buyers from Central Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Europe and Asia.They say their contracts are for specific qualities and quantities for 2021 up to 2023.Many of the direct contracts are in respect of bespoke and customised categories of teas which are not sold through the auction and which have been certified by different agencies such as Rainforest, Fairtrade and Ethical Tea Partnership.These teas fetch a higher premium overseas.The implementation of the law in question will result in the association members being unable to fulfil their contractual obligations.They will lose the financial benefit of the direct/forward contracts which offer better and higher returns than auction prices.In addition, the implementation of the law in question will give a competitive edge to other countries in the region that will be able to continue selling their teas directly.Justice Mrima further suspended the implementation of the sections of law being challenged.The case will be heard on February 22."
361,Senate to blame for City Hall woes - Elachi,"Former Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi now says the Senate is to blame for what is happening at City Hall.Elachi on Monday said though the Senate did an amendment to the County Government Act, it did not resolve issues like what is currently happening at City Hall.She said, as a result, there are no clear guidelines on what should happen in case a governor is impeached in the absence of the deputy governor thus leaving a lacuna.She said the County Assembly is a powerful tool and if they decided to reduce the vetting time for Kananu as DG is was within their rights.Elachi while speaking on Citizen TV said Kananu should not be criticised or blamed for what happened.""This country has very vibrant institutions and with good people in them, Kenya can really move. The floor of the house is powerful and anything they do goes through until it is challenged in court,"" she said.""Nairobi has many challenges and I hope what has happened serves well for all Nairobians because what they want is calmness.""Kananu on Monday took over as Nairobi acting Governor three days after she was sworn in as deputy governor.Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura officially handed over the instruments of power to Kananu in a ceremony at City Hall.Mutura said since Nairobi now has a substantive Deputy Governor in office he has relinquished his acting Governor capacity and resumes his full duties as Speaker.Elachi who served as a nominated Senator in the 10th Parliament said the only undoing for the process is that it will be dragged in court and moving to the next level will be a big challenge for Kananu.Her sentiments come amid sharp criticism after Kananu was vetted and sworn-in as the deputy governor for Nairobi county in a five-hour record time.Kananu last week Friday appeared before the County Assembly's committee and was sworn-in before 2pm.The move has sparked sharp criticism with various quarters including the Law Society of Kenya moving to court to challenge the process.LSK on Monday moved to court seeking to block the possible swearing-in of Kananu as Nairobi Governor.Also sought is an order to suspend her swearing-in to the office of deputy governor which happened last Friday.The society believes that the hurried swearing-in of Kananu to the office is illegal and a brazen attempt to undermine the process of a by-election as required by the Constitution.Elachi in her sentiments said having Kananu as the deputy governor will not solve the current lacuna at city hall.""The powers of a deputy governor are limited and the only way Kananu can help Nairobi, is being elevated to the governor position,"" she said.Former Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke said what happened at City Hall was totally foreign to any provisions of law a clear indication that the law has become a burden to the country.""It bothered me deeply because it was unconstitutional, impunity and violation of the constitution. Whoever planned and executed that fraud should be held responsible,"" Mueke said.Mueke said the County Governments Act gives clear guidelines on how a deputy governor comes to office.""In this case, the question is if Sonko has been impeached, who signed Kananu's appointment letter and who is she deputising?"" he posed.Mueke said since IEBC which is only mandated to suspend an election had set the Nairobi by-election for February 18, it was unfair for the county assembly to hijack that process.""By allowing the vetting to happen the county assembly missed the mark. I am not sure what part of the law is not clear but in my view, they should be held liable for the abuse of power because they knew it was wrong,"" he said."
362,"Be wary of the 'hustler' narrative, Uhuru tells Mt Kenya","President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday appeared to throw jabs at his deputy William Ruto over the 'hustler nation' narrative.Speaking to Kikuyu stations, the President warned his Mt Kenya backyard that the 'hustler' narrative would set a dangerous precedence. The Head of State said that there was no way that one can deal with the issues facing Kenyans by dividing them along the class lines.""There are people who are focused on divisions. But let me tell you the truth. Please, there is nothing as important unity in this country,"" Uhuru said.He added; ""I am begging you our people, do not be incited by people just because of a few coins.""Ruto has been pushing the 'hustler' narrative where he says that every hustle matters and the government should deal with the issues affecting the ordinary citizen.His allies have used this to push for his 2022 bid by branding his competitors including Raila Odinga and Gideon Moi as dynasties.But Uhuru told the Mt Kenya voters not to be misled by this narrative saying that it was likely to cause more divisions in the country.""I am a student of history. If you don't know where you came from, you can't know where you are going. Let's not only walk together as people but with the rest of the country,"" Uhuru said.The President was speaking on Inooro, Kameme and Gukena radio stations in an interview that was recorded on Sunday evening.Uhuru is known to retreat to his backyard either in person or on vernacular radio whenever he wants to directly address that constituency. Uhuru revisited his recent comments in Vihiga where he said he would use the same anti-dynasty logic to says that Kenya had been led by two tribes and it was time for others to take over.""My comment during the funeral seemed to have touched a raw nerve. Did you see the reaction it elicited?"" Uhuru said while laughing.He explained that he made the comment to caution people that leadership emanates from uniting Kenyans, empowering them and not dividing them.""We must focus on what will protect you, your children and your children's children. And don't get me wrong, I am not forcing you to be with me but don't trust anyone blindly,"" the President said."
363,"Cops launch manhunt for man who stabbed, killed brother in Murang'a","Police have launched a manhunt for a man who killed his brother after a quarrel in Muranga county.DCI boss George Kinoti said on Monday that Christopher Wakahiu, 26, is being trailed after committing the murder on Sunday evening at a construction site in Murang'a's Jerusalem area.The victim, a businessman in Nairobi is reported to have visited his parents at Gaturi village over the weekend, and on his way back passed by the said site to check the progress of a structure he was raising. ""While at the site, he was joined by the suspect, whom he had employed as a caretaker,"" DCI said. The two are said to have engaged in a quarrel over an unestablished issue, when the caretaker -Christopher - drew a knife, stabbing his brother deeply into the left side of the chest thus killing him instantly. Kinoti asked Kenyans to help the police arrest the man who is currently in hiding.""Should anyone have information on the whereabouts of the suspect, please contact the DCI through our toll-free hotline number 0800 722 203. This service is available 24/7,"" he added."
364,BBI cost: People are stealing up to Sh2 billion daily - Uhuru,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has once again admitted to corruption within his government while defending the cost of BBI.Speaking to Kikuyu stations on Monday morning, Uhuru insinuated that the country was losing up to Sh2 billion a day to corruption.""I don't know where people got the cost of Sh2 billion or Sh14 billion. But even so, these people are on a daily basis stealing that Sh2 billion you hear people talking about. These people are deceitful,"" Uhuru said.The President had been asked whether he knew how much the proposed BBI referendum would cost.He noted that it was too early to talk about cost yet the document was still with IEBC for signature verification before going to the county assemblies.""However, if the proposals will help us give more money to the grassroots, the cost of the referendum should not be an issue,"" Uhuru said.There has been debate on whether the country should spend money on a referendum at this time.The IEBC had put the cost of the referendum at Sh14 billion but ODM leader Raila Odinga dismissed it and said the cost should not be more than Sh2 billion.More to follow...Read also:"
365,"Uhuru rallies Kikuyu nation behind BBI, dismisses critics","President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday morning spent time appealing to his Mt Kenya backyard to support the Building Bridges Initiative.The President said that the problem facing BBI was that the perception created by BBI was about supporting one person and undermining another.""I have never said that this is about supporting this person or undermining this other one. My goal is towards peace, unity and the prosperity of the country,"" Uhuru said.He added; ""My greatest worry is that politicians are focused on the 2022 elections instead of focusing on the issues facing Kenyans.""The President clarified that he has never said that he supports ODM leader Raila Odinga or any other person related to the handshake.The President also took a blow on Deputy President William Ruto saying that even when he goes out there, he makes claim to the things that the government has done.""People ask what the government is doing. But even those who are going around the country, what do they do when on those cars? They talk about the roads, electricity and water as part of the achievements of the government,"" Uhuru said.The President was speaking on Kikuyu vernacular stations in an interview that was recorded on Sunday afternoon.Uhuru is known to retreat to his backyard either in person or on vernacular radio whenever he wants to directly address that constituency. The President also dismissed claims that the BBI referendum would cost billions of shillings that can go elsewhere.""We are not even there yet. The verification of the signatures has not even been completed and the Bill is yet to get the county assemblies. And even when they talk about Sh2 billion, that is the same amount of money they are stealing daily,"" Uhuru said.The President also took the time to revisit the events leading to the handshake after the 2017 elections.He said that he made the sacrifice because Kenya is more important than any individual.""I, therefore, decided to look for our competitors and I told those who we had been elected with my intentions with the sole aim of ensuring we do not have chaos after future elections,"" Uhuru said.Uhuru said that following their discussions with ODM leader Raila Odinga, they identified inclusivity as the main issue that needed to be dealt with.He added that the other issue they identified was underrepresentation which was undermining the equitable distribution of resources.The President said that the third issue was devolving of development to the counties and thus the proposal to increase allocation to the counties.Uhuru added that the issue of unemployment was also key to the handshake and thus the proposal for the tax holiday for youth firms.""If we empower the youth through businesses and tax breaks, we will have nibbed a problem in the bud. Let us focus on what will protect you, your children and your children's children. I am not forcing you to be with me but don't trust anyone blindly,"" Uhuru said."
366,Why vehicles plunge into the ocean at Likoni ferry,"Vehicles and the Indian Ocean have made strange bedfellows the past few years. ‘Bus plunges into Indian Ocean at Likoni ferry crossing in Mombasa.’‘Lorry plunges into Indian Ocean at Likoni channel.’‘Car overturns at Likoni channel hours after trailer plunged into ocean.’‘Bodies of woman, daughter yet to be found after Likoni ferry tragedy.’‘Canter plunges into Indian Ocean while disembarking.’‘Kenyatta University bus almost plunges into the Indian Ocean.’Despite journalists capturing photos and stories of mishaps at the Likoni Ferry crossing channel, little has been done to stop the tragedies from recurring.The crossing is a must-use for anybody visiting the award-winning Diani beach by road, or for wildlife lovers going to watch the elephants of Shimba Hills and for those crossing to head over to the neighbouring Tanzania via the Lunga Lunga border.The sight of a ferry cruising across the blue waters while carrying passengers and vehicles is fantastic, but the trouble lies in embarking and disembarking it, especially for motorists.It is a puzzle drivers have to crack every day for a successful six-minute ride across the channel before attempting to get it right again while disembarking.Buses, trucks and trailer drivers have few seconds to navigate the steep slope, uncontrolled pedestrian traffic and vehicle congestion to avoid a tragic end.SLIPPERY SLOPESalim Omar, driver of the Pollmans Tour bus that plunged into the ocean at the mainland side on January 10, said he has used the channel for more than 11 years.“I’m not a new driver. I have driven cars, buses and all kinds of vehicles across this channel and I'm not a learner at all,” Omar said in a phone interview with the Star.After dropping tourists at a hotel in South Coast, Omar and his guide were returning to Mombasa island when the bus slid into the ocean as he attempted to board MV Safari at around 10am.“I tried to apply breaks but it kept sliding into the ocean. The work of the Kenya Ferry Services officials should be to alert us which areas to avoid when getting into the bus,” he said.Due to their experience with the ocean since childhood, both the driver and the guild managed to get to safety while their bus remained calmly floating in the morning high tide, like a water vessel.Two days later, a semi-trailer carrying tiles from Tanzania plunged into the ocean at the same point, after hitting the ferry's prow and losing control, according to a KFS statement posted on its official social media sites.After the two incidents, KFS put a notice on their Facebook page that read: “Safety tip: Avoid slippery surfaces.”Another post told motorists: “Direct your vehicle to the ferry entrance points to avoid going off the ferry prows.”EASIER SAID THAN DONEDrivers, however, say the warnings only sound good on social media as corresponding actions by officials on the ground are lacking.While many say the ramps get slippery when it rains, even on a normal day, drivers say silt left by the tide in the ramp is more slippery to vehicle tires.For longer vehicles like buses, trucks and trailers, drivers have to snake into the ferry so as not to have the rear of the vehicle stuck on the ramp.If the driver avoids the snake movement and decides to board in a more direct manner, the front tires will be in the ferry and the rear tires on the ramp, making the wheels on the middle axle which drive the truck to hang.To complicate matters, many trucks that use channels are heavily loaded, some bringing tonnes of goods from Tanzania and vice versa.With increased loads, the risk of sliding into the waters during the rains is high.While the passenger traffic is more controlled during the boarding, when the ferry crosses, passengers often rush to disembark with vehicles as security officers struggle to control them.A driver of a loaded truck snaking its way out of the ferry has to be extra keen while climbing the steep slope, and even more keen not to injure impatient passengers.“It’s difficult work. I’m used to crossing here but manoeuvring up this mountain is no easy task,” Bakari Charo, who regularly transports timber from Tanzania into the port city, said.“We don’t why they put it this steep and our lorries are always loaded.”Charo said a small miscalculation will get your lorry into the ocean.“That kind of slope needs very experienced drivers, who know how to play with gears,” he said.HISTORY OF ACCIDENTSDespite the drivers’ concerns of a steep gradient at the ramps, said to be cause of accidents in the past, little has been done to redesign it to counter future incidents.On November 2019, a Kenyatta University bus was filmed struggling to ascend seconds after disembarking from a ferry on the mainland side.In a statement, KFS said “the driver of the bus failed to negotiate uphill momentum”.While the KFS noted it was the fault of the driver, two months earlier, the management had failed to explain how a car slipped off ferry midway, plunging into the waters, tragically drowning a mother and her daughter.The September incident, which saw agencies take a record 11 days to recover the bodies of Miriam Kighenda and her four-year-old daughter Amanda Mutheu, drew condemnation and uproar over safety of motorists in the channel.When the wreckage of their Toyota ISIS car was retrieved, exclusive pictures by the Star showed the gear in park position, against earlier reports that put blame on the driver, saying she might have accidentally reversed the car into the ocean.Many expected that the tragedy might have jotted the KFS into action on re-evaluating their risk analysis and mitigation strategies.The only notable change was a change in security guard company at the channel.But observers have in the past argued that owing to the incidents, security personnel, other than being muscular, need to have extra skills, like diving and responding to incidents at the channel.More than 300,000 people and 6,000 vehicles cross the Likoni ferry channel every day.Last week’s incidents showed the first responders were volunteer divers and passengers who were waiting to cross. They turned into rescuers before other agencies, including Kenya Navy and Kenya Coast Guard, who take pride specialising in water safety, arrived later.While the tourist bus and the truck were retrieved, critics say such efforts to retrieve vehicles from the ocean should be redirected to preventing such incidents from occurring in the first place.The Kenya Maritime Authority, Kenya Ferry Services, Kenya Navy, Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya Coast Guard Services all practise their craft in the ocean, but it remains to be seen how joint efforts can help stop the incidents at the ferry.Recent incidents have left many speculating about other vehicles lying deep in the ocean, with others wondering just what it will take to warrant a tangible safety review in the channel.Edited by T Jalio"
367,Kamba community under political attack – Kalonzo,"Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said Ukambani is under political attack.Speaking at AIC Kasina in Mavoko, Machakos County on yesterday, he said there are plans by other political affiliations to divide the Kamba community by fielding several candidates for the Machakos senator by-election on March 18.In what seems to be a message to Deputy President William Ruto’s UDA party, Kalonzo castigated politics which he referred to as spiritual warfare being mounted in the region by the deep state.“As a community, we are under attack. This is a spiritual warfare. What we are wrestling against is not about flesh and blood, but against spiritual powers,” Kalonzo said.The Wiper leader called on the church to pray for the country.Kalonzo said political extremism can lead to devastating consequences.Leaders present urged Kenyans to embrace peace, love and unity during campaigns for the upcoming by-elections.They included CAS Transport Wavinya Ndeti, Machakos Woman Representative Joyce Kamene, and MPs Patrick Makau (Mavoko), Robert Mbui (Kathiani), Charles Ngunga (Mwingi West), Joshua Kimilu (Kaiti), Dan Maanzo (Makueni), former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile and Machakos Wiper senatorial candidate Agnes Kavindu Muthama.They said they will not allow outsiders to breach the peace of the residents through politics of hatred, ethnicity, hustlers’ and dynasties’ inclinations.Ndeti said it was important to engage residents peacefully not only during the political season but at all times.“It is very important to have peace.  As leaders, what you say can unite or divide the citizens. We need to work together because bad politics is not good. We will get you out of our borders if you want to divide us, she said”Kalonzo lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for letting the Machakos by-elections go without fielding a Jubilee candidate and thanked him for allowing Kavindu to join the Wiper party though she contested on a Jubilee ticket for the Machakos Woman representative’s seat in 2017.He, however, said he will not step down for anybody but get to the ballot as a presidential candidate in 2022.He said God had given him a gift of uniting this nation.Kalonzo criticised those bashing him for nominating Kavindu for senator on the Wiper ticket, saying it was about leadership and nothing else.He praised Kavindu, saying she has leadership abilities and is able to deliver if elected.He asked for all the elected political leaders on various positions both parliament and Machakos County Assembly to drum up support for the Wiper candidate in the by-elections.The Wiper leader also called for re-enforcement of the impeached Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko stating that he could be politically sacrificed.“I have done everything to bring Sonko together to make him work with the President. I want to advise that security arrangement be made to protect Sonko‚” Kalonzo said.Elsewhere in Matuu Catholic church, Maendeleo Chap Chap candidate Mutua Katuku, who was in the company of Yatta MP Charles Kilonzo and Machakos Deputy Governor Francis Maliti, told off Wiper saying he was the best“Oversight is not fighting. I’m up to the task. There are many counties where the Governor and Senator are from the same party and they work smoothly. I urge other aspirants to step down in my favour to save the resources‚” he said.Kilonzo dismissed the claims saying Kalonzo was an outsider in the Machakos politics.“Machakos has its own presidential candidate and homegrown party, the MCC. All the other actors are outsiders. Machakos has supported wiper in the past. They should return the favour by supporting our candidate this time round‚” he said.Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
368,Gitogoto: Tharaka Nithi village with no mobile network,"With two rivers on either side and Mount Kenya on the other, Gitogoto village is literally cut off from the rest of Tharaka Nithi.It is safe to say they live inside the forest. Residents have to cross the river to venture out but their is no bridge, so they walk through the forest.Mobile phone network is rare.Residents have appealed to both the Thraka Nithi and national governments to build them permanent bridges across the two rivers.They also wish the network providers could mount masts to make communication easier.“We climb to higher grounds to talk via phones and sometimes it is a total failure. We rarely get government services. Some politicians even never visit the village as they think they Kiamuriuki is the end of where people live,” Margaret Muthoni said.There are no roads there. The only link road does not even have murram.Another resident who identified himself as Moris said they are also faced with landslide challenges during the rainy season.His timber house was partly swept and destroyed by a mudslide days ago.Walking to Gitogoto from Kiamuriuki is scaring because of the risk of encountering wild animals. The animals often stray away from the forest that has an electric fence.Gitogoto is  12km from Kiracha on the Meru-Nairobi road.The residents are believed to be members of the Ameru community who have their roots from Karingani, within the outcasts of Chuka town in Tharaka Nithi county.They no longer speak their ancestral language. Their Kimeru has been incorporated with Embu language. The village is at the border of Tharaka Nithi, Meru and Embu counties.They are surrounded by River Thuci that flows towards Runyenjes in Embu county.Elders said 90 per cent of women married in Gitogoto are from the Embu community.“Only those who were born before 1966 were lucky to get wives from their original tribes before migrating. We live in isolation compared to our Embu neighbours. When it rains, movement becomes difficult,” Josphat Gitari said.Gitari was a teacher before he retired in the 1970’s.He is the Thuita and Magumoni Njuri Ncheke Supreme Council of Elders chairman said he could not state his exact age because dates were not important when they were born.In 1938 and 1939, locals were forcefully chased away from their land which was inside the forest, he said. The first forest line at Muutini which marked the actual border that ran along the forest joining Karingani, Magumoni, Mwimbi and Gitombani.He said they were ressetlled in their present-day village by a white settler.“We don’t live in the forest. It lives within us. So many people would as well claim ownership. We have been fighting to reclaim our land back but it has been unfruitful,” Gitari said.Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki has established a state of the art, well equipped and staffed dispensary at Gitogoto in the middle of the forest.They also have a primary school built by MP Kareke Mbiuki through the NG-CDF. They hope a secondary school will soon be constructed,. The nearest is Kiamuriuki Secondary School in Magumoni.There is no shopping centre in Gitogoto and the few canteens do not stock all the basic goods.They often travel for kilometers to Kathageri in Embu especially on Sundays to buy foodstuffs, clothes and their other necessities“We do not benefit from the forest at all. Ten years ago before the electric fence was erected, it was hectic.

369,"Ruto removal plot thickens as ANC, ODM plan meeting","Talks about Deputy President William Ruto impeachment are expected to gain momentum this week, with ANC and ODM planning a meeting on Tuesday.This is the third time Ruto is being asked to resign or face impeachment.Multiple sources said ANC bigwigs will be meeting their ODM counterparts to discuss the impeachment motion. But allies of Ruto have rubbished the plot.ANC deputy party leader Ayub Savula confirmed he will Tuesday meet the Minority Whip in the National Assembly and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed.“I will be meeting Junet on Tuesday to discuss the numbers in the National Assembly,” Savula told the Star.The Lugari MP said he had also discussed the matter with officials of other like-minded parties.But ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya said he was not aware of the planned meeting. He said his party was not part of the impeachment plan.“That is a very weighty matter which cannot be decided by two people. It needs the entire leadership of the two parties,” Oparanya said.But remarks by BBI secretariat co-chair Dennis Waweru and Junet over the weekend suggested there could be a wider plot to impeach Ruto.Waweru, an ally of President Uhuru Kenyatta, said Ruto should make up his mind and decide whether to work with Uhuru or quit the government.“The Deputy President must shape up or ship out. Why sabotage the work of the President if he does not want to work with the government?” Waweru asked. Junet called on Ruto to resign or face impeachment.“The Deputy President has been operating from the streets as if he has no office. We want him to resign or we impeach him. You cannot be in government and opposition at the same time. Choose one,” Junet said.Allies of Ruto laughed off the impeachment calls, saying they have no basis and ANC would not marshal the numbers to remove the DP.Lang'ata MP Nixon Korir wondered where ANC would get the numbers to successfully impeach the Deputy President.“I think ANC is overly excited with what the President said recently. They don't have the grounds and the numbers to impeach the Deputy President,” he told the Star.Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro said those calling for the removal of Ruto “do not understand what impeachment is all about. Savula is a conman overworking to save himself from prosecution,” he said.Savula, however, insisted that they have strong grounds to impeach the Deputy President.“We will make the case that because his [Ruto's] ambition is in competition with priorities set by the government he serves in, he is a danger to the stability of the nation by covertly dissenting and sabotaging the President’s agenda. He does that through incitement of the vulnerable poor,” Savula said.Kibisu Kabatesi, the spokesman of ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, said the capacity to see the motion through Parliament is not just a question of numbers as Tangatanga MPs would like Kenyans to believe.“Revolutions and change have not been made by the madding crowd but by the strengths of commitment and belief by a few vanguards. Jesus Christ did not have a mob with him when he spread the gospel that has captured and drives millions faithful throughout the world for centuries now,” Kabatesi added.He said if the Deputy President strongly disagrees with his boss, the only honourable thing is for him to do is to call it a day.“For the undiscerning, what is going on in Kenya is an insurrection similar to the one engineered by Donald Trump in the USA. But unlike the USA where it is limited to intimidations, the instability wrought by this insurrection will lead to dismemberment of the country,” Kabatesi said.ANC has only 14 MPs in the National Assembly. A member of the National Assembly requires to be supported by at least a third of all the members (117) to move a motion for the impeachment of the Deputy President.At least two-thirds of the members - 233 of the 349 – are needed to approve the motion.If approved, the motion will be introduced in the Senate, which will conduct a trial to ascertain the charges.Two-thirds of the senators -45 of the 67- are needed to send the Deputy President home. ANC has three senators.Savula, however, remains confident that ANC will raise numbers in the National Assembly and the Senate. “The Deputy President boasts of having more than 150 MPs in the National Assembly. We will see about that when the time comes.” The Constitution says the Deputy President may be removed from office on the grounds of physical or mental incapacity to perform the functions of the office; or on impeachment on the grounds of a gross violation of the law.The Deputy President may also be removed where there are serious reasons to believe that he/she has committed a crime under national or international law or for gross misconduct.This is not the first time Ruto is being asked to resign or face impeachment.In March last year, a group of ODM and Jubilee legislators asked the Deputy President to resign citing alleged corruption cases, dishonesty and unexplained wealth.In October that year, Ruto was put on the defensive over polarising premature political campaigns and utterances against state agencies during a stormy Cabinet meeting. Some members asked him to resign."
370,"Raila, Ruto trade barbs over unfulfilled Jubilee promises","ODM leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto are engaged in a bitter exchange over Jubilee administration failures.Raila has linked the DP to the failed Jubilee promises and projects while Ruto on the hand accuses the Opposition chief of plotting an exit strategy out of the handshake.Ruto said Raila's recent attacks on the alleged Jubilee’s unfulfilled promises is suspect.He said if Raila is uncomfortable with Jubilee, then he should bolt out instead of attacking the administration. He accused Raila of stalling government projects through the BBI.Rutyo said Raila’s recent onslaught on the Jubilee’s failures is a sign of someone with one leg outside the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta.“We know their plan is to leave (the handshake) but are still looking for a scapegoat. When you joined Jubilee, you didn’t know those promises had not been fulfilled or you realised yesterday?” the DP posed.On Sunday, Raila said the DP is the reason why the Uhuru-led Jubilee administration has failed to honour most of its pre-election ledges.He cited the flopped laptops projects for schools, one million jobs promise to the youths, 47 modern stadia and 100,000 kilometers of tarmac road as some of Jubilee's unfulfilled promises.Raila challenged Ruto to explain what befell the ambitious Jubilee promises instead of preaching the hustler narrative. Raila said the hustler narrative does not offer sustainable solution to problems facing Kenyans.The opposition chief said it is dishonest of Ruto to start campaigning before delivering the promises they made to Kenyans.He said the change of the narrative by the DP is evidence enough that he cannot be trusted to deliver to Kenyans when elected president.""They promised many things in six months. Now they have forgotten and are saying they now care about the youths and the poor. What happened to the promises of stadia?""Ruto who attended a church service in Londiani, Kerticho county fired back, blaming Raila of stalling the Jubilee manifesto through the Building Bridges Initiative.“We had plans for many dams but we (Jubilee administration) were visited by the devil who spoilt everything. Petty politics found its way into the dam project and now our efforts to provide water to our people has stalled,” Ruto said.The DP defended the Jubilee administration saying they have delivered more than any other government in post-independent Kenya.Ruto was at Kipkelion East constituency where he presided over the opening and consecration of AIC Londiani Town Church.Raila also dismissed claims that Uhuru is taking him for a ride and will not support him in 2022.Speaking to residents of Soweto in Embakasi East constituency in Nairobi, Raila dismissed critics saying they will be in for a rude shock.He termed talks of being abandoned by Uhuru as propaganda by Tangatanga wing who are not happy with the cordial relationship he enjoys with the President.""Wengine wanasema ooh Uhuru anadanganya Raila..takaktaka hiyo..{some people are saying Uhuru is cheating Raila ..that is utter rubbish},"" Raila said.He added: ""We will stand or fall together.""He said his march to Canaan is well on course and called on Kenyans to support the law change through BBI stating it will herald a new dawn for the country.""We posed our journey to Canaan, time is now. We want to walk together,"" he said.ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna said the party will not quit the handshake and will instead support every step taken by the two principals.""As ODM, we are not parting ways with Uhuru. Where he will go we will be there together,"" Sifuna said.Raila was speaking after attending a church service at Soweto Catholic Church.He was accompanied by Sifuna and MPs Babu Owino, Maina Kamanda, Junet Mohamed, Sam Atandi, Pamela Odhiambo, Antony Oluoch, Florence Mutua, Godfrey Osotsi, George Aladwa, Esther Passaris, Raphael Wanjala and Millie Odhiambo. Edited by P.O"
371,Why Uhuru has kept off Mt Kenya BBI push,"President Uhuru Kenyatta may not hit the ground to campaign for the Building Bridges Initiative in his Mt Kenya backyard any time soon, his allies have said.  The President’s inner circle feels that it would be too early for the head of the state to popularise a document that is still with the IEBC and is yet to be approved by county assemblies.This is why an advance team of Cabinet secretaries, principal secretaries, and senior government officials has been mandated to market the document in the region.The team, which will be headed by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, met on Friday in Nairobi to chart a plan.ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru, Transport's James Macharia, Energy PS Joseph Njoroge, Education CAS Zack Kinuthia and Agriculture CAS Annie Nyagah were named as members of the committee.The meeting convened by Macharia also resolved to form a co-chaired committee to discuss economic empowerment of the Mt Kenya people.Muranga Senator Irungu Kang’ata, in a terse letter to President Kenyatta, warned in December last year that the BBI faced defeat in the region.He asked the President to personally lead campaigns for the document, saying the timing of the constitutional change process was off.“Efforts need to be made to rally regionally all MPs irrespective of their political factions behind this cause,” the Senate Majority Whip told the President. ODM leader Raila Odinga’s camp has appealed to the President to accompany the former prime minister on tours of the region.The President has been pitching for the BBI in his various addresses, saying the country is in a constitutional moment.President Kenyatta's bitter falling out with Ruto and his bromance with Raila has stirred a storm in the region, muddying the waters for BBI there.A senior government official who attended the La Mada meeting but sought anonymity to speak on the matter said the President may lead a BBI drive only at the tail end of the process.The thinking, the official said, is that the President would be going against his word on premature political campaigns.The officer said constant politicking was the reason for the ""now-obvious fallout between President Kenyatta and DP William Ruto"". “When the President starts campaigning, he would be derailed from achieving his agenda for Kenyans. That is why we will still see less of him in public rallies.”First in their agenda, the insider said, is to separate the issues captured in the Building Bridges Initiative from the 2022 succession politics.“BBI is our agenda and being a document with a lot of promise regarding solving the problems we have in terms of what it offers, we think it should be supported,” the senior official said.He said they are working on a plan to give more information on the goodies in the BBI document to counter the narrative sold by the Tangatanga faction of Jubilee.The Cabinet team, the official said, will work with elected leaders to deliver this plan, adding that all political leaders –including those in Tangatanga, will be involved.“We will meet as a group of elected leaders and government officers and come up with a strategy to market the document,” the official said.“We are still trying to put our thoughts together to have a strategy. It is not a secret. It will be inclusive. When it comes to the ground, MPs will be the ones to speak with the people.”He said they are looking at including leaders from both the Executive; Legislature and community leaders who interact with wananchi such as church leaders so that all are on the same page.“We are doing this with the view that even if we have different views, at least people are given an opportunity to say why they oppose or support and then we build a consensus.”“We don’t expect everybody to agree and disagree. Much as this is politics, we also feel the BBI will take the country forward,” the official said.Public Service CS Margaret Kobia, who was part of the meeting, said senior government officers – in the Munya team – have reached consensus on the strategy.The BBI popularity has suffered a hit in the wake of the jostling for the region’s vote and the positioning by leaders bidding for seats there.In the face of the fever of 2022 politics kicking, a number of politicians have shied away from touting the document, ostensibly to avert a backlash from locals against the BBI.But Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni, a key BBI proponent in the region, dismissed the notion and moved to lift the lid on why the pro-BBI team in Mt Kenya has yet to begin work aggressively. He said the document may appear to be facing resistance because those who are pro-BBI have not sold it in Mt Kenya.“The only narrative that has been available to the people is the one fighting the BBI. Those who are pro-BBI have not gone to the people. Why? We have a plan.”“You cannot go to the people before you secure the signatures. You cannot go to the people when the document is not with county assemblies, or before it is passed by Parliament. You go to the people when you are now telling them to pass the document in a referendum. We have a plan,” he said.Urging for patience, Kioni said, “There sounds like there is resistance because only one side of the narrative has been sold.”“When we go out and sell, our selling will be the easiest because we will be selling the truth. When that time comes, we will be asking all to do their bit because this document is for Kenyans,” he said.Kioni said at the moment any leader, including chiefs and pastors who have understood the BBI can to sell it.“The civil servants – PSs, CSs, heads of parastatals, should do their bit. I will then expect the political leadership to be at the forefront in doing their bit.”“That political leadership will be guided by the President who is the top leadership in our region,” Kioni said, expressing confidence that the document will be passed.“With the little we have done casually, everybody has been asking us why we have not come to tell them more. But we say that time is not yet here.”Prof Peter Kagwanja, a political commentator from Mt Kenya, said the problem in the region is that the kingpin (President Kenyatta) has not marketed the BBI himself.He argued that there is anxiety over the President’s imminent exit in 2022 “so leaders and some residents see opportunity in Ruto.”In his view, the BBI is seen as a Raila sweetener to bag the Mt Kenya vote, a constituency which DP Ruto is laying 2022 political stakes on.“People are ready to forego the goodies in the face of the perception that the BBI is a Raila project.”Kagwanja’s point is that the people want someone who sits at the negotiating table from the region to speak about the BBI.“The tide will change when the President hits the ground to market the document which has more for Mt Kenya compared with other regions.”National Assembly Majority Leader Amos Kimunya slammed those pushing for the President’s personal presence for BBI campaigns.  He said the process is sequential, saying there was no way they can go to wananchi before the bill is ready and anyone citing delays must be blind to the process.“The real roll-out would only be after the county assemblies approve the bill. Even so, you will notice that there are more people accepting it before the roll-out,” the Kipipiri MP said.He added that those who have been campaigning against the BBI would “soon lack lies to spread over the document.”“How will they tell Kajiado, Uasin Gishu, Kiambu, Kwale and Kilifi and so on to oppose the BBI yet they are bound to get additional constituencies?” Kimunya asked. “In the meantime, there are small initiatives at the individual level. If we come out now, we have people asking us why tell us about a document that is still with the IEBC?”Kimunya warned of trouble for the anti-BBI forces saying more people are appreciating that the BBI has nothing to do with Uhuru or Raila’s 2022 plans."
372,"Explainer: Genesis of Uhuru, Ruto fallout","The March 9, 2018, handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his once-erstwhile rival Raila Odinga could be the lethal injection that killed the bromance the head of state and Deputy President William Ruto displayed ahead of the 2017 polls.This was shortly after the second stab of their joint ticket, now under a unified Jubilee Party, whose victory was declared after a heavily contested election.The DP did not attend the historical event, which would later change the country’s political dynamics a great deal, many pointing to the tranquility that ensued.Prior to the handshake, there was tension amid Raila laying claim to the presidency, and his camp questioning the legitimacy of President Kenyatta’s election.The shadows of the dramatic 2017 elections (the first one was nullified by Chief Justice David Maraga) spilt into 2018 with Raila’s mock swearing-in as the people's president.Persons, many of whom have now shifted to Ruto’s camp, made a passionate call for the ODM leader’s incarceration for treason.They lamented that the handshake would finish the dynamism that was President Kenyatta and Ruto ahead of the 2017 vote.The President, in May, announced that the handshake should be extended across the country. He attempted to bring a truce between Ruto and Raila.Uhuru declared he was not interested in a third term and urged patience among politicians seeking to succeed him.Raila’s entry into the Jubilee matrix largely complicated the DP’s stay in Jubilee. Cracks in the ruling party began to manifest.The DP’s allies lamented there were hidden cards in the handshake at Harambe House doorsteps which swept away the tension at that time within seconds.What followed was that the DP would stay away from key state functions – save for national holidays.Less pictures of him together with Uhuru were published – unlike in the days of matching ties.Many have argued that the wedge got wider after the DP somewhat defied President Kenyatta’s call for an end to politics to allow him to work and deliver his legacy.The DP had at this time embarked on nationwide tours “inspecting development projects” – tours which earned his camp the name Tangatanga.Ostensibly irritated, the President issued an executive order putting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i in charge of state projects.The President further banned launches of any project unless approved by the Cabinet committee chaired by the Interior CS.Undeterred, Ruto continued with his Tangatanga meetings – largely taking advantage of Sunday services where 2022 succession politics was rife.President Kenyatta’s allies fired warnings that the defiance would be punished.Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe was blunt with the DP, saying he would not succeed President Kenyatta and that they preferred Raila.Tables would later turn against the DP in a bloodbath that saw his allies purged from plum leadership posts in the National Assembly and the Senate.Their crime, it has been argued, was centred on a feeling they would frustrate the Building Bridges Initiative—the handshake baby.Ruto poked holes into the BBI, critiquing the document and the process, and recently said he would not want to be part of it.His apparent opposition to the unity bid, which President Kenyatta is banking on to cement his legacy, has been touted as the last nail on the UhuRuto politics.The President was clear about it with his remarks that the presidency is not a preserve of two tribes – Kikuyu and Kalenjin; of which the DP belongs to the latter.President Kenyatta’s latest assertions contrast their 2017 campaign slogan that he (the President) would serve his two terms and hand over to the DP for another 10 years.Murathe is of the view that the point of departure was that “DP abandoned the Big Four agenda and went on a different tangent.”"
373,"We won't budge, striking health workers tell governors","Striking health workers have pledged to defy sacking threats by governors and stay away from public hospitals. Speaking in Nairobi on Sunday, clinical officers said counties were being insincere and misrepresenting their demands.Kenyan Union of Clinical Officers secretary-general George Gibore said no county has been asked to allocate resources to pay medics' allowances as they have been alleging.“Since Covid-19 came, we have been fundraising to foot bills for our colleagues who have been hospitalised, including when they die,” Gibore said.He said they had requested counties to table any contracts they have with health insurers but they had yet to do so.Clinical officers went on strike on December 7 demanding timely payment of salaries, adequate provision of PPE, allowances bump among other demands. After a series of meetings with the governments, they called off their strike on January 1.One week later, they went on strike again after their agreement was rejected by the Council of Governors. The strike enters its forty-second day today. Nurses and lab technologists are also on strike.Patients continue to suffer due to lack of health services in public facilities.Despite the return-to-work formula documents being ready, the CoG has distanced themselves from the process, saying they were not consulted. The CoG has maintained they won’t pay the striking healthcare workers a single coin.But KUCO maintained that their strike is legal and protected as there is no court order that has invalidated it. They termed as ridiculous the governors' complaint about the perennial and prolonged strikes yet they were yet to sign the agreement with workers. “We, as healthcare workers, are in a very difficult situation. We will not go and we cannot go on a suicide mission. When we swore the Hippocratic Oath we swore to protect the lives of our patients, the protection of that life includes ourselves vacating the hospitals if we feel we are presenting more harm to the patients coming to us than we are able to do good to them,” KUCO chairman Peterson Wachira said.“So for those who are saying we should consider our oath; we are actually within our oath. One of the reasons we are out was to ensure a safe working environment which would be safe for the patient and for us.”Gibore said their strike was necessitated by poor and unsafe working conditions especially, lack of quality and adequate PPE.Other grievances were dubious contracts, lack of enhanced comprehensive medical cover and group life insurance, understaffing, failure to pay UHC staff for more than six months and non-commensurate and discriminative risk allowance."
374,Kitui MCAs approve hiring of 7 CEC nominees,"The Kitui county assembly on Friday approved the hiring of seven county executive members. The new CECs are expected to help Governor Charity Ngilu's administration improve service delivery over the next 18 months. Ngilu's cabinet has been operating with only four CECs. In 2017, Ngilu hired nine CECs but three executive members resigned and two others were fired. Those who resigned were the Treasury, Health and Education CECs Mary Nguli, Rosaita Ngina and David Kivoto respectively.John Makau of Environment and Philip Mumo of Trade were relieved of their duties by the governor.On Friday, MCAs were recalled from recess by speaker George Ndotto to a special sitting to approve or reject a report by the county assembly's appointment committee on the vetting of the nominees.The report, which was read to majority leader Peter Kilonzo, was unanimously endorsed by the assembly.The six whose hiring was approved are Winfred Kitetu (Health and Sanitation), Stephen Maithya (Education and ICT) and Samson Musila (Lands and Urban development).Others are Esther Kilonzi (Agriculture and Water), Hellenah Kitheka (Tourism and Culture), Meshack Muthusi (Trade and Cooperatives) and Caroline Musango (county attorney).Kilonzo said the seven were not only highly qualified but had demonstrated impeccable knowledge of the mandate of the position they were nominated to by Governor Ngilu.Minority leader Alex Nganga said the incoming CECs, the majority of whom are women, will solve the gender issue in Governor Ngilu's cabinet.The MCA for Miambani said after the resignation of the only two women, the governor was criticised for lack of gender balanced.Nganga said the youth, who were seen as having been sidelined, got a slot.Majority of the MCAs hailed governor Ngilu, saying she got it right with her pick."
375,"Ex-governor Cheboi, six others to take on Kiptis in Baringo","Former Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi is among six people who have shown interest in contesting for the county's top job in 2022.Cheboi conceded defeat to incumbent Stanley Kiptis in 2017 and handed over the seat of power. On Saturday, Cheboi told Kiptis to prepare for a loss as he will trounce the governor in the next poll. ""I handed over willingly and accorded you all the space to serve so I equally expect when the time comes you will hand it over back to me in good faith,"" he told Kiptis. Cheboi spoke during the funeral of Betsy Jepkorir, a Baringo county employee, at Solian in Eldama Ravine Subcounty.Jepkoris was the wife of Caleb Kipchirchir, also an employee of the county government. She succumbed to breast cancer on January 11. She is survived by her widower and two children.Cheboi further called upon President Uhuru Kenyatta to consider handing over power to a people's elected leader when his 10-year term elapses in 2022.""The late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta handed over the presidency to Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi back in 1978, then Moi did the same to Mwai Kibaki in 2002 and Kibaki relinquished the mantle to Uhuru in 2013, that is a show of good leadership,"" he said.He was backed by Eldama-Ravine Member of Parliament Moses Lessonet who also declared his ambition to vie for the governor's seat in 2022.""I want to urge our people, let's desist from voting in people who have not been tested and proven to hold critical leadership positions because some may be having questionable records,"" Lessonet said.  He said his three terms as MP make him a suitable candidate for the job.The other aspirants for the governor role are Tourism and Wildlife Principal Secretary Fred Segor, Baringo assembly clerk Richard Koech, retired commissioner Haron Komen and former Kenya School of Government Baringo campus director Isaac Chebon.Governor Kiptis eulogised Jepkorir as a lovable, kindhearted, hardworking and reliable employee of Baringo county. The county chief said she served with exemplary commitment and diligence. He also took the opportunity to urge his opponents to stop early political campaigns instead appealing to them to offer him the relevant moral support.""I don't deny competition but let's bring together our hands and serve the people of Baringo now. When the time comes, then everyone will present his or her own scorecard for the people to decide,"" Kiptis said."
376,"Growers raise concerns over plan to import 57,473 tonnes of sugar","Cane growers want the government to regulate sugar imports to protect the sector.The farmers said there are plans to import 57,473 tonnes of sugar to cover the deficit in the country. “This move to import the sweetener is a scheme to illegally bring in sugar into the country,” Kenya Sugarcane Growers Association (Kesga) secretary general Richard Ogendo said.“We want to call on the Kenya Revenue Authority to ensure that any entity importing sugar into the country is charged applicable import duty as a way of cushioning cane farmers from the cheap imports.”Charles Atyang' of the Kenya Association of Sugarcane and Allied Products (Kasap) called on the Ministry of Agriculture to make public the list of sugar importers to ensure transparency.KRA in a memo dated December 24 notified staff members on the exhaustion of allocated quotas under Comesa safeguards for 2020 as at October 31, 2020.However, a review of adapted 41st Comesa Council report dated November 26, 2021, showed that the quota safeguard covers March 1 to February 28, 2021In the memo, analysis of sugar imports from March 1, 2020 to October 2020 indicated that only 192,527 tonnes of the allocated quota of 250,000 tonnes were imported.“Consequently, there is a balance of 57,473 tonnes of sugar to be cleared under Comesa framework for the remaining period until February 2021,” the notice by acting Commissioner for Customs and Border Control Pamela Ahago said."
377,[PHOTOS] Raila continues onslaught on Ruto over failed promises,"ODM leader Raila Odinga has challenged Deputy President William Ruto to explain to Kenyans what befell the ambitious Jubilee promises he made in the run-up to the 2017 elections.The opposition chief said it is dishonest of Ruto to start campaigning on the hustler narrative before delivering the promises he made to Kenyans.He said the change of the narrative by the DP is evidence enough that he cannot be trusted to deliver to Kenyans when elected.""They promised many things in six months,"" Raila said on Sunday.""Now they have forgotten, they are saying they now care about the youths and the poor. What happened to the promises of stadia?""He cited laptops to for primary school children, one million jobs, 47 modern stadia and 100km of tarmac road as some of the unfulfilled Jubilee promises.Raila was speaking during a church service at Soweto Catholic in Embakasi East Constituency.He was accompanied ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna, are MP Babu Owino, Maina Kamanda (nominated), Junet Mohammed (Suna East), Sam Atandi (Alego Isinga), Pamela Odhiambo (Migori MP), Antony Oluoch (Mathare), Florence Mutua (Busia MP) and Godfrey Osotsi (nominated).Others were George Aladwa (Makadara), Esther Passaris (Nairobi MP), Raphael Wanjala (Budalangi) and Millie Odhiambo (Suba North).On Friday, Ruto reiterated that he will continue with his hustler narrative, adding 'every hustle counts'.""We will not buy your threats... saying you will bring DCI, KRA, EACC.... We will not go back. Kenya belongs to everyone and work is work,"" he said.The DP also reiterated his message that Kenya should not be divided on tribal lines.""There are people who were not happy Jubilee was uniting people and they hatched a plan to split the party so that Kenya is split. Even if they split the party, Kenya's unity will not be divided,"" he said."
378,"Rutto won't last in DP camp with his diva behaviour, says Salat","CCM party leader Isaac Rutto's move to back Deputy President William Ruto does not bother Kanu, secretary general Nick Salat has said.Salat on Sunday said Kanu is unshaken, and accused Ruto of not being forthright in politics.Rutto, a former Bomet governor, joined Ruto on the campaign trail on Saturday as the DP preached against opponents calling for a rotational presidency.Rutto had previously played a key role in Baringo Senator Gideon Moi’s campaigns in the race to State House in the region.Salat said, “Just like any other political party, we shall continue selling our agenda to the people ahead of 2022…we shall take our case to them and leave it for them to decide.""He said the political ‘romance’ between the once-political nemeses was not going to last, the secretary general said Rutto ""is known to be an unreliable man who hops from one camp to another"".“He is not a man steady politically, you cannot be here today, and tomorrow you are there. In fact when he came back to us I was sure he will not stay because he is known to issue demands that cannot be met by anyone hence forced to move out,” he said.He added, “The reason he is jumping from this camp to the other is because of the demands he issues to be met before declaring his support and I am quite sure no one will give him the attention he needs there.”Speaking to the Star, Salat pointed out that the decision taken by Rutto was an act of desperation saying it was neither policies nor principles that have made him join the DP’s camp but “other underlying issues.”On BBI, the secretary general said, ""He is not the man in charge of BBI in the region; we have Paul Sang (former Buret MP), he has only been in the forefront about it.""He further asked the residents of Bomet not to panic saying they should go for leadership and shun people who want to do business with them.Rutto who will seek governorship in Bomet in 2022 has promised to fully support the DP in his presidential ambition."
379,Kalonzo campaigns for Kavindu as Machakos senator by-election hots up,"AIC Kasina church in Mlolongo, Machakos county, was on Sunday fumigated minutes before Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka visited.Former Kibwezi West MP Kalembe Ndile and a host of Wiper MCAs from Machakos county assembly also attended.The Wiper party brigade is expected to launch a political campaign to popularise its Senator candidate Agnes Kavindu after the service.A rally has been planned at Athi River town within Mavoko constituency.The Wiper candidate will be facing off at the ballot with several aspirants including Albanus Muthama Ngengele (UDA), John Mutua Katuku (Maendeleo Chap Chap), Simeon Kitheka (GNDP), Lilian Nduku Mwanzia (CCU), among others.Kavindu's nomination by the Wiper party was met with mixed reactions among electorate and several politicians not only from Machakos county but across the Ukambani region with some claiming Kalonzo is using Kavindu to settle political scores.Kavindu is the ex-wife of Kalonzo's friend-turned-foe Johnston Muthama - who is also the former Machakos senator.Kalonzo on Wednesday said he is not out to wreck families as he unveiled former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama’s ex-wife as the party’s candidate in the March 18 Senate by-election.“For the avoidance of doubt, this movement does not believe in wrecking families, we must make this very clear. We are not taking that name because of that any other name. What has guided the party is her own qualification as a leader who demonstrated high leadership capability,” Kalonzo said at Wiper headquarters in Karen.“She just happened to share the name with other people.”"
380,Kuppet boss to teachers leaving Knut: You're not welcome,"The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education and Teachers has warned tutors who quit Knut not to join them.Kuppet national chairman Omboko Milema said the decision by over 100,000 primary school teachers to quit Knut was a risky move.“Former Knut members are not welcome to Kuppet because our membership is properly stipulated…we take post primary and technical institutions tutors only,” Milema asserted.Kuppet, Milema on Saturday said had 110,000 members and will not accommodate those leaving Knut.“It would be like deciding to have one union which is against the spirit of trade unionism and beats logic the purpose of the creation of Kuppet which was to accommodate post primary and technical teachers,” Milema added.He was speaking in the Kapsabet CITC grounds when he presided over Kuppet Nandi county Branch elections in which Jairo Tormoi trounced Martin Kilel to become the new chairman.Paul Rotich successfully defended the lucrative branch executive secretary seat, beating Henry Sirma while Salim Bakhit was re-elected to his position of the treasurer.""Teachers who voluntarily decided  to resign from their Union (KNUT), please don’t make any  attempt to join us ...” said Milema.Adding that if they would accept such a move, primary school teachers would displace secondary and technical institutions tutors currently holding various leadership positions in Kuppet.Before a decision by the teachers employer, Teachers Service Commission decided to activate an online resignation platform for Knut members, it boasted of 280,000 memership.TSC currently has about 350,000 teachers in its payroll - 110,000 being from Kuppet while Knut has 28,000 members while over 200,000 are not in any trade union.Misfortunes hit the former giant union after ODM party nominated Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion to Parliament to represent the interests of workers.However, his nomination in 2017, did not go down well with the Jubilee government and teachers' employer TSC.At one point, Sossion was stripped of his registration as a teacher  by TSC before going to the High Court seeking reinstatement.Sossion said he will neither quit Knut nor relinquish his nomination as a member of Parliament.A week ago, ODM leader Raila Odinga hit out at TSC for killing Knut."
381,"Bungoma risks losing World Bank cash over graft claims, infighting","Bungoma risks being dropped out of a list of counties benefiting from a Sh350 million annual  grant from the World Bank following graft claims and infighting over agriculture projects.The projects are funded by the  National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth Project (NARIGP)  implemented by the Kenyan government through the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, State Department for Agriculture (SDA), with funding support from the World Bank. The intended beneficiaries of the project are communities in 21 counties which are - arid areas (Turkana and Samburu); semi-arid areas (Makueni, Kitui, Embu, Meru, Kwale, Kilifi and Narok); and medium-to-high rainfall areas (Kirinyaga, Kiambu, Murang’a, Nakuru, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Nandi, Vihiga, Kisii, Migori, Nyamira and Homa Bay).The project aims at increasing  agricultural productivity and profitability of targeted rural communities in selected counties and in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency, to provide immediate and effective response.However, the NARIGIP project is facing a major crisis after claims  of embezzlement of funds by county officials  were raised to the World Bank prompting  a forensic  audit.After the audit,  World Bank recommended that the project is stopped.At the center of the matter are Bungoma CECM in charge of Agriculture Chirasha Makanda, his chief officer John  Wasike and one of the project heads Mary Situma .Trouble started when Makanda and Wasike wrote to World Bank requesting Situma be removed from the project citing incompetency.  Situma however wrote back to the World Bank citing graft in the project saying she could only hand over after some audit queries are dealt with and adding she didn’t want to be followed thereafter because of mistakes committed by her seniors.In several of her letters to the World Bank seen by the Star, Situma cites frustration from Makanda and pressure on her to give money which she has declined.“The CECM for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, Irrigation and Cooperatives, Mr Matthews Wanjala Makanda, has on many occasions put pressure on me to resign  to pave way for his dubious deals which I have since declined ,” read the letter from Situma to the World Bank in part.Situma in one of the letters  further alleges Makanda has been taking away project money to fund his political ambitions . “In June 2019, the CEC  took the imprest of  2,714,100  through one of the project managers to allegedly bribe MCAs who had vowed to impeach him,” it reads in part .Speaking to the Star, Makanda however refutes the claims, describing Situma as an ""incompetent and incorrigible liar"", saying she was haunted out of the project after she failed to make proper proposals.“This I can even repeat in a court of law. Situma is being ousted out of the project because of incompetency. This woman not only  is evil but also an incompetent and incorrigible liar,” Makanda said.Makanda accused her of sabotaging projects funding by not submitting project proposals  to the  World Bank and failing to give cooperative societies money already availed.“This lady has really let us down, we are always number last in  the ranking  because of her projects and we are forced to return money back to World Bank  because she hasn’t given the cash to groups,” said Makanda.He refutes claims that he embezzled funds, saying the money that was taken as imprest was returned after a few months  and there was no cause for alarm.Makanda further alleges that all his moves have a blessing of the World Bank regional offices.Situma on the other hand  refutes claims of her failing to submit proposals saying Makanda had forced the money to be diverted to build bridges for political reasons which she says the World Bank had declined.“It is him Makanda who was trying to force construction of bridges for political reasons which was not part of the World Bank objectives which they declined. How am I supposed to be blamed,” she said.In a preliminary audit report seen by the Star, the  World Bank auditors propose that the project be stopped due to graft and infighting."
382,Museveni takes lead as Bobi Wine cries foul,"Uganda's long-time President Yoweri Museveni has a clear lead in the presidential race following Thursday's vote, preliminary results show.The country's electoral commission has dismissed allegations of vote rigging, made by opposition candidate Bobi Wine, a former pop star.But election monitors say confidence in the count has been damaged by a three-day internet outage.Final results are expected to be confirmed on Saturday.Dozens of people were killed during violence in the run-up to the election. Opposition politicians have also accused the government of harassment.President Museveni, who has been in power for 35 years, is hoping for a sixth term.The 76-year-old says he is standing for stability. Meanwhile Bobi Wine - the stage name for 38-year-old Robert Kyagulanyi - says he represents the younger generation in one of the world's youngest countries, where the median age is 16.On Friday, as the results came in, Bobi Wine said that Ugandan soldiers had surrounded and breached his home.""None of these military intruders is talking to us,"" he said on Twitter. ""We are in serious trouble.""But a government spokesman accused him of ""dramatising"" the incident ""to seek sympathy"".""Bobi Wine at this moment is a very important person. It is the duty of the state of Uganda to ensure he is secure,"" Don Wanyama said.What are the latest results?Based on provisional results from two-thirds of polling stations, Mr Museveni has so far won 62% of the vote compared to Bobi Wine's 30%, the electoral commission said.Election commission chief Simon Byabakama said the vote had been peaceful, and called on Bobi Wine, who said some of his polling agents were arrested on Thursday, to make public the evidence for his fraud allegations.The opposition candidate believes the internet shutdown is being used to block communication and as a way of compromising the vote.As well as being unable to get online, people have been having trouble sending text messages.""Several of our phone numbers, including mine and my wife's, have been switched off, have disconnected illegally,"" said Bobi Wine, according to Reuters news agency.""I will be happy to share the videos of all the fraud and irregularities as soon as the internet is restored.""The electoral commission says only two polling stations in the country reported major irregularities and voting was cancelled in those locations.Mr Wanyama, who is a spokesperson for President Museveni, also hit back at Bobbi Wine's claims of vote rigging.""He came short of the expectation of Ugandans,"" he said, speaking to the BBC. ""He had no message and Ugandans have told him he has to wait a little longer.""Mr Wanyama added: ""We have challenged him to provide proof for his claims, he has not a single iota of evidence.""BBC correspondents say there is tight security in the capital, Kampala, with soldiers and police patrolling the streets.The EU, United Nations and several rights groups have previously raised concerns about the integrity of Uganda's election.But, aside from an African Union mission, there is currently no major international group monitoring the vote. Earlier this week the US - a major aid donor to Uganda - cancelled its diplomatic observer mission to the country, saying that the majority of its staff had been denied permission to monitor polling sites."
383,JSC commences preparations to replace Maraga,"The Judicial Service Commission has announced start of recruitment preparations for the next next Chief Justice.This follows retirement of CJ David Maraga on January 12.In a statement on Friday, the commission said the process shall commence by the publication of the Notice Declaring a Vacancy in the Office of the Chief Justice on  January 18.""Following publication of the Notice, the search for a candidate, and the recruitment process and its attendant timelines, will be governed and conducted in accordance with all the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the law,"" JSC said.The position is currently being held by CJ Philomena Mwilu in acting capacity.It is uncertain whether Mwilu will be a leading candidate to succeed Maraga considering she is battling a petition before the Commission.Meanwhile, there are questions as to whether Kenya needs an insider and conservative CJ like Maraga, who shocked the world by nullifying the 2017 presidential election, or a liberal judiciary head.CJs and other judges, though described as conservative or liberal, often surprise with their rulings once they sit on the bench.In his retirement speech, Maraga challenged judges to stand firm and not let the political class plunge the country into chaos.“You live in this country, and you have seen the drums of political war beaten already. If you waver and do the wrong thing and this country descends into chaos, God will never forgive you,” he said.Maraga reminded them that they have been given the power to be guardians of the Constitution, and they should not let Kenyans down by bending to political whims.“I have heard sometimes politicians say they are better off because they are elected. I want to tell you that according to constitutional architecture they have no better power than what you have. I want to urge that you don’t let the people of Kenya down.”"
384,Suspect arrested manufacturing unlicensed alcohol in Nandi,"A woman has been arrested on suspicion of manufacturing counterfeit alcohol at her residence within Mosoriot area, Nandi County.Monica Chepkinyor Senja was nabbed by an intelligence led operation conducted on January 13 after residents complained of increased deaths due to sub standard alcohol in the market.According to a police report released on Friday, goods worth Sh7 million were confiscated during the operation led by Rift Valley regional manager Nicolas Kinoti.""Thirty cartons labelled manufactured by Metro Breweries of Spike vodka with 20 250ml bottles each were found,"" the police said in the report.""Another 14 cartons labelled manufactured by JJasm Distillery Ltd of Idakho vodka each carton containing twenty 250ml bottles totaling to 280 bottles were found.""Other unlicensed alcohol found in the suspect's residence include 26 cartons  shakers vodka labelled manufactured by Mamboleo Distillers, 30 cartons Piston vodka and 30 more cartons of Rock star vodka.The detectives verified that all the 2,600 bottles were affixed with suspected counterfeited Kenya Revenue Authority excise stamps.The cartons were seized and transported to Eldoret office for further investigation."
385,NLC to scale up alternative dispute resolution systems,"The National Land Commission will scale up alternative dispute resolution systems to expedite determination of disagreements on land. NLC vice-chairperson Getrude Nduku said on Friday that there is a massive backlog of cases registered with the commission.Nduku made her remarks during a virtual meeting to sensitise civil society, the media, community and faith-based organisations on the contents of the draft strategic plan 2020-25.Nduku said land disputes have caused loss of lives, money and property.Acting NLC chief executive officer Kabale Tache said the strategic plan has been developed through public participation.She said the plan is also aligned with national development priorities, the Constitution, Vision 2030 among other blueprints.Tache urged community organisations to continue working with the commission to bring the much-needed reforms.The CEO thanked civil society for helping the commission during the school titling process.Under the lapsed 2013-18 strategic plan, the NLC said it acquired land worth Sh38.273 billion for 77 public projects.It says  15,513 complaints were received out of which 5,773 were investigated or reviewed and 4,088 determined and gazetted.The commission says 693 historical land injustices claims were received, out of which 126 were admitted, investigated and determinations issued.The commission says it resolved various disputes through alternative mechanisms, a cost-effective and quick way.It prepared 1,624 extensions and renewal of leases; approved 3,290 subdivision or amalgamation schemes, 1,925 change or extension of user and 2,566 building plans.""We processed over 60,000 requests; dispatched 3,020 transfers of public school land to relevant registries for registration from an audit of over 10,000 public schools,"" NLC says.The commission says it received 3,865 letters of allotment, out of which 382 were verified.It says it handled over 4,000 cases that were filed in different courts country wide.On the allocation of public land, it says it processed over 6,000 requests from counties for unalienated public land.NLC says its financial requirements for the planning period are expected to grow marginally over the first three years from Sh3.448 billion to Sh5.132 billion and reduce to Sh3.594 billion by last year.Commission chairman Gershom Otachi said they will focus on development at the county level.Otachi said the commission in the next five years is committed to delivering on five key areas.These include management and administration of public land, security of rights, revenue generation, and strengthening of the commission."
386,End of the road for Nairobi governor hopefuls,"It is end of the road for a number of hopefuls who had expressed interest in the Nairobi governor by-election after the record vetting and swearing-in of Anne Kananu as deputy governor.MCAs on Friday vetted and approved Kananu whose nomination by Mike Sonko last year had been subject of a protracted legal battle until last week when the petition was withdrawn.Kananu will now be sworn in as substantive governor, taking over from impeached Sonko and thus stopping the by-election that had been scheduled for next month.Kananu, a criminology graduate, served as Disaster Management chief officer in Sonko's administration and goes into history as the first woman deputy governor of Nairobi county.Last Tuesday, the Star exclusively reported a possibility of Nairobi not going into the February 18 by-election.Friday's events now stop what would have been a gruelling political duel in the capital city.It had been already billed as a supremacy contest between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga on one side against Deputy President William Ruto.Jubilee had cleared BBI secretariat co-chair Dennis Waweru, Agnes Kagure, Betty Adhiambo, Alex Kipchirchir and Habib Omar to participate in its primaries.Lawyer Miguna Miguna and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru had also been nominated by Thirdway Alliance and UDA respectively to contest.Also in the race were former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu, Ogwang Raymond Ndungu, Kiigi Jasiel Njau, Kimore Evans Machoka, Lengala David William, Hassan Jimal Ibrahim, Dr Noah Winja Migudo, Otieno Aloys Lavern, Mukundi Mathenge, Munyanya Yassin, Olingo Timothy Ayieko and Njuru Phyllis Wangari.They had been gazetted as independent candidates.On Friday, constitutional lawyer Waikwa Wanyoike described the turn of events as a serious constitutional coup.""Let it be on record that what Nairobi County Assembly has done in vetting and approving Anne Kananu as DG and obviously making her governor – with the urging of Uhuru and Raila – is a constitutional coup,"" he said.Thirdaway Alliance vowed to move to court to challenge what it termed blatant disregard and mutilation the Constitution.National chairman Miruru Waweru, in a statement to newsrooms, said the approval and swearing-in of Kananu was unconstitutional and would set a bad precedent if allowed to stand.“If there is any doubt in this country that we are speedily sinking into a dangerous pit of dictatorship and blatant disregard for the Constitution, today’s events at the Nairobi City County Assembly, and the illegal manoeuvres by a section of the political class to undermine the sovereign will of the people are your clearest answers,” he said.“Once again, as we have done and are actively engaged, this chipping-off of our constitutional foundation will find its equal challenge in our courts and all public platforms; this is a duty we hold dear and which we cherish discharging.”After being sworn in as the substantive governor, Kananu will then be expected to appoint her deputy – a position that multiple sources told the Star will go to ODM in the spirit of handshake.ODM had initially withdrawn from the by-election and declared it will back Jubilee’s candidate.The Raila-led ODM is said to have lined up several candidates to deputise the Jubilee candidate for the seat.Some of the names being mentioned include secretary general Edwin Sifuna and Women’s league president Beth SyengoEdited by Josephine M.

387,Tribunal holds that ex-city official owes KRA Sh33m,"The Tax Appeals Tribunal has held that former Nairobi Finance chief officer Jimmy  Kiamba owes the Commissioner of Domestic Taxes Sh33 million.In March 2020, Tribunal chairperson Moses Obonyo stated that Kiamba owed Sh33,841, 991,000 and not Sh402 million contained in a review application by the  Commissioner for Investigations and Enforcement.The amount is payable for the period 2007 to 2014.Obonyo's decision has been upheld by Eric Wafula, who chaired the tribunal hearing the review of the first judgment. He dismissed the review application.“The tax payable for the period of 2007 to 2013 is assessed at Sh33,841,991,00,” the tribunal said.Wafula in his ruling dated December 11, 2020, said the additional Sh800 million contained in the review application was not properly assessed.He said the appellant (Kiamba), in the view of Obonyo’s judgment, went on and paid the Sh33 million to the Commissioner of Income Tax."
388,Stigma among other issues limiting access to maternal health,"Long distances to health facilities, high costs, religious and socio-cultural beliefs and practices limit access and utilization of reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health services in the country.Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has also identified stigma and shame surrounding sexual and gender-based violence compounded by challenges in accessing other non-health sector interventions that determine health outcomes as some of the barriers that need urgent intervention.The situation has been made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic that saw the downward trend in provision in these services, with mothers shunning visiting health facilities for fear of contracting the virus.The situation forced the government to set up a task force to ensure the services are maintained in the country.Speaking on Friday, Kagwe said the Covid-19 pandemic has not spared our country and as much as we tried our best we know our essential health services have been affected negatively and we may have realised a downward trend in the provision of essential services.“The most affected area being the RMNCAH services which is the backbone of our primary health care. The task force has successfully put measures in place to ensure these services are not interrupted hence reducing morbidities and mortalities from non-Covid-19 cases.According to the CS, the guidelines are now being used by the global community in addressing their challenges.“I am aware that Kenya along with DRC, Ethiopia and Tanzania is among  countries in the Global Financing Facility process and I appreciate the global community for putting their trust in our country.”Latest data from the Health Ministry shows that one in every 37 pregnant women in Kenya will die due to complications while giving birth.This means that 362 women out of 100,000 women die while giving birth.Thus, the ministry launched a country platform to advocate for reproductive and maternal health services in Kenya whose key role will be to collaborate, coordinate and ensure there is intersectional alignment when it comes to resource investment in reproductive health in Kenya.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
389,You have no numbers: UDA responds to threats by ANC to sponsor Ruto's impeachment,"United Democratic Alliance (UDA) – a party associated with Deputy President William Ruto – has laughed off threats by ANC to sponsor impeachment motion against the DP saying the party has no numbers.Top party officials termed as ridiculous the censure threats by Musalia Mudavadi led party stating the plan will not see the light of the day.Former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale said ANC with its 13 elected MPs in the National Assembly cannot even produce a chair of a committee.“Impeachment motion is a question of numbers, ANC has 13 members of Parliament, it means even in a committee of Parliaments of 29 members, ANC does not have majority to force to get a chair of a committee,” Khalwale said.He added: “To attest to this, all committees in parliament, ANC does not have a chair either in National Assembly or Senate.”Khalwale said nobody should threaten Ruto with impeachment when he is yet to join UDA.“They {UDA} have told the public that they want to impeach the DP. We are wooing the DP when he finishes his term in 2022 to join our party so ANC should not start intimidating the DP just because it looks like he might associate with UDA,” he said.The ex-senator spoke during the presentation of UDA nomination certificate to Urbanus Ngegele Muthama who will fly the party’s flag in the March 18 Machakos senatorial by-election.On Tuesday, Mudavadi's Amani National Congress Party asked Ruto to resign or face impeachment over his remarks at the weekend.ANC deputy party leader Ayub Savula said the DP's attack on President Uhuru Kenyatta warrants calls for his resignation.""He called the President a tribalist. How can you say your boss is a tribalist?"" he stated."
390,Naivasha residents want share of fluoride-free water,"After years of consuming water with high levels of fluoride, residents of Naivasha now want a share of the clean water meant for the industrial park in Mai Mahiu.In the last couple of months, engineers have sunk six boreholes near River Karati and are building a pipeline to the multibillion-shilling park.Residents of the lakeside town have had to make do with water containing high levels of fluoride for years.They have suffered a lot and deserve a share of the fluoride-free water, MP Jane Kihara said.The high levels of fluoride in the water affect bone and teeth development.“We support this project that seeks to supply the industrial park with water and residents of Naivasha, Longonot and Mai Mahiu should also benefit,” she said.Water CS Sicily Kariuki, who toured the area to inspect the project, said residents of Naivasha, Longonot and Mai Mahiu would get a share.“The ministry has signed various water policies and one of them is that residents of an area where water is sourced will benefit from the product,” she said.Kihara said construction of the proposed Malewa dam, which was to serve Naivasha, Gilgil and Ol Kalou towns, was shrouded in controversy.“Our youths have for years been affected by the high fluoride in the water consumed and this can be resolved through this water that is meant for the industrial park,” Kihara said.Lakeview MCA Simon Wanyoike termed the project a blessing.“The boreholes that have been sunk are located in my ward and the only way the government can give back to the community is through sharing the water with area residents,” he said.Edited by Josephine M.

391,State lauds efforts to save northern white rhino as two embryos produced,"The government has lauded efforts being made to save the northern white rhino from extinction following the recent successful production of two embryos.The consortium of scientists working to conserve the species said the embryos were cryopreserved on Christmas Eve when they reached the blastocyst stage suitable for freezing. The breakthrough increases the total number of viable embryos produced so far to five. Tourism CS Najib Balala said the country is committed to facilitating this collaborative process to its logical conclusion.  ""I am delighted that the world has a chance through use of cutting edge and innovative technologies to save this threatened wildlife species for posterity and that Kenya is playing its part in this critical conservation effort,"" he said. ""Remember, extinction is forever. Once we lose this species, we will have lost an iconic animal which will not be seen again by future generations.”On Thursday, the Ol Pejeta Conservancy said in a statement that on December 13, 2020, a team of Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Safari Park Dvůr Králové, Kenya Wildlife Service successfully performed an oocyte collection in Kenya.""After immediate transportation of the recovered oocytes across continents, the embryos were created at Avantea laboratory in Cremona (Italy) following maturation and fertilisation of the oocytes with the semen of Suni,"" the conservancy said.Females Najin and Fatu at Ol Pejeta are the only remaining northern white rhinos in the world.The scientists harvest immature egg cells (oocytes) from the two females and artificially inseminates them using frozen sperm from deceased males in order to create viable northern white rhino embryos. In the near future, the embryos will be transferred into southern white rhino surrogate mothers to create northern white rhino offspring. The conservancy said the Covid-19 pandemic seriously affected the process of oocyte collection and fertilisation in 2020, delaying the production of new embryos.At last, in December 2020, 14 oocytes were retrieved from Fatu’s ovaries using a probe guided by ultrasound, after the animal was placed under general anaesthesia. The oocyte pickup device is an internationally approved patent. Both the anaesthesia and the ovum pickup procedure went smoothly and without complications. After incubating and maturing the egg cells in the Avantea laboratory, eight of them were fertilised with thawed sperm from deceased northern white rhino bull Suni using a procedure called intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection.Two fertilised oocytes developed into a viable embryo with the help of Geri®, an innovative benchtop incubator with integrated continuous embryo monitoring capabilities.The embryos are now stored in liquid nitrogen along with the three embryos from previous procedures.Unfortunately, no oocytes were retrieved from Najin, who is Fatu’s mother. Previously, collecting oocytes from Najin was successful, but no embryos were created from her egg cells. The team of rhino reproduction specialists from the Leibniz-IZW, led by Prof Hildebrandt, see two possible reasons for this repeatedly negative outcome: Najin’s age and or health issues could affect the quality of her egg cells. In addition, the 31-year-old rhino has a large tumour in her abdomen, which at this point does not cause acute health problems but may hamper the functionality of reproductive organs. Since every step of every procedure within the programme is accompanied by a thorough ethical risk assessment, the team will decide only after a health check whether to continue oocyte collection from Najin during the next visit planned for later this year.The successful embryo creation in December 2020 is a conciliatory end to a challenging year for the northern white rhino rescue programme and the world of conservation at large.The procedures scheduled for March and June had to be cancelled or postponed owing to the global Covid-19 pandemic. In August 2020, the team was finally able to repeat the oocyte collection, with the disappointing result of no embryos created. The reproduction specialists concluded that the unintended span of nearly nine months between procedures affected the results.The successful procedures in December have proven that a regular rhythm of repeated oocyte collections every three to four months is key to their success. Therefore, the team intends to continue with this cycle if possible.In December 2020, the team also started the next phase of the ambitious project – the preparations of the transfer of the embryos into southern white rhino females.For this purpose, a southern white rhino bull was transferred from Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to Ol Pejeta Conservancy in November 2020.This bull has fathered several offspring and is thus considered a proven breeder, which is the reason he was a suitable candidate to be taken out of the breeding group at Lewa and transferred to Ol Pejeta.At Ol Pejeta, he was sterilised by the BioRescue team with a minimally invasive non-surgical procedure. A thorough ethical risk assessment has been applied to this procedure.The sterilisation procedure went smoothly and without any complications. The bull started to eat immediately after the anaesthetics wore off.As a sterilised bull he will reliably indicate through his behaviour the reproductive cycle of potential surrogate mothers without the risk of impregnating them.This indication is a crucial prerequisite for transferring the valuable northern white rhino embryos into surrogate mothers at the correct timing of their reproductive cycle.After the team has confirmed the success of sterilisation in March 2021, the bull will be constantly monitored to record whether his behaviour indicates potential surrogate mothers’ cycles.The “BioRescue” research programme is led by Leibniz-IZW and funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.Its goal is to significantly advance assisted reproduction techniques  and stem cell associated techniques for the benefit of the northern white rhinoceros."
392,"Mt Kenya CSs, PSs hold talks on BBI, region's development","Senior government officials from Mt Kenya on Friday held a private consultative meeting a Nairobi hotel to chart development plans for the region.The meeting attended by Ministers, chief administrative secretaries, and principal secretaries was convened by Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia.It was co-chaired by his Agriculture counterpart Peter Munya and Interior PS Karanja Kibicho.Munya on Friday posted on Twitter; ""This Morning I Chaired a very successful breakfast meeting of senior government officials from Mt. Kenya region and it's diaspora at Lamanda Hotel Nairobi.""They resolved to form a committee led by the two co-chairs to discuss economic empowerment of the Mt Kenya people through agriculture.The team will lay down plans for the tea, coffee, milk, and horticulture industry in a bid to boost farmer’s returns.ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru, CS Macharia, Energy PS Joseph Njoroge, Education CAS Zack Kinuthia, and Agriculture CAS Annie Nyagah were named as members of the committee.Sources at the meeting intimated to the Star that the committee would also chart the way forward for the region, including their preferred presidential candidate for 2022.An attendee said the deliberations followed the ‘emerging political concerns in the region.’“We are going flat out to deal with the cries of our people which we are seized of, especially farmers. As the government, we believe a lot has been done but there is still more to go,” the state official said.The team also discussed the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) and how to engage Mt Kenya on the document.There is talk that President Uhuru Kenyatta may have lost his grip of the region to the growing hustler wave championed by his deputy William Ruto.Another official who attended the meeting said that it was important for them to find a better approach to sell BBI in the region.""We evaluated the letter by Kang'ata and we find merit in it. We cannot fail the president and therefore, it is important that we handle this matter effectively and efficiently,"" the official said.Senator Irungu Kang’ata alluded to this in his recent terse letter to the President warning that the BBI was bound to be defeated in the region.He said that there was a general feeling of economic deprivation at household levels in the region, adding that it gave fodder to anti-BBI forces.“It appears households incomes have either stagnated or plummeted. Many have blamed the stagnating of tea, coffee and milk prices on the government and thus argue BBI is less of their concern,” Kang’ata wrote."

396,"DPP to lose security of tenure in BBI plan, Maraga warns","Former Chief Justice David Maraga has warned that the fight against corruption is bound to fail, citing plans to remove the security of tenure of the DPP.He argued that the proposed amendment to the Constitution to repeal Article 158 would expose the DPP to work at the whims of the President.The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020, under the BBI initiative seeks to delete the procedure for removal of the DPP.Maraga in an interview aired on Citizen TV on Thursday night said this would result into the removal of the security of tenure of the DPP, and as such would be exposed to state machinations keen on frustrating justice.“How are you going to fight corruption when you have exposed the DPP?” Maraga asked, adding that the article was put in the Constitution deliberately.“How do you expect the DPP to order the investigation of a Cabinet Secretary when he knows he’d be hounded out of the office? It throws out of the window, the fight against corruption,” he said.Maraga said the Constitution provisions on the DPP tenure followed the days when the Attorney General prosecuted cases; an era he argued gave room for pursuit of political causes using the justice system.“Remember when the AG used to conduct prosecution, some cases were political. Cases would start and proceed and once the ends were achieved, they were vacated…a total abuse of the process,” Maraga said.He added that Kenyans decided to give DPP security of tenure for six years non-renewable, to make the office independent and take appropriate action to prosecute crime.“When you remove that, you expose him. When appointed to a position, you plan your affairs within that time. Anything interfering with that term will affect you.”However, the BBI bil seeks to include the Directorate of Public Prosecutions in the Chapter 15 Commissions and Independent institutions.The BBI proponents, in the memorandum of the Bill, say this would enhance the independence and budgetary autonomy of the office.BBI also seeks to enhance the qualification for appointment as DPP to be the same as that of a judge of the Court of Appeal.At the moment, one is required to qualify as judge of the High Court to be DPP.The bill further seeks to align the removal and resignation of the Director of Public Prosecutions with that of the constitutional commissions and independent offices.“This is to reflect that the office of Director of Public Prosecutions is proposed to be included as an independent office in Chapter 15 of the Constitution,” the bill reads.Going forward, constitutional commissions would be required to enhance corporate governance practices in managing their affairs.In the current law, a DPP is removed from office by a recommendation of a tribunal reporting to the President.Any person desiring to remove the DPP may present a petition to the Public Service Commission setting out the charges constituting the grounds for the removal.The PSC then considers the petition and if satisfied there is sufficient ground, sends the same to the president.The President on receipt and examination of the petition suspends the DPP within 14 days and appoint a tribunal to look into the matter.The tribunal shall consist of four judges or persons who have held office as judge of a superior court; an advocate of at least 15 years nominated by LSK; and two persons with experience in public affairs.The team then inquires into the matter and makes recommendations to the President, whom is expected to act in line with the same.The Constitution provides that commissioners and members of the independent institutions - which the DPP is being elevated to, are removed by petitioning the National Assembly.MPs then consider the petition, and if satisfied, send the same to the President who then may suspend the member and appoint a tribunal.A judge of a superior court shall be chairman; with other members being two persons qualified as High Court judges; and an individual who can assess the facts in the grounds of removal.The president is expected to act on the recommendations of the team appointed to look into the matter."
397,Sh34bn 'lying idle' in CBK vault tied to projects — governors,"Governors have dismissed claims they have money idling in accounts at the Central Bank yet counties are starved of cash.The National Treasury in a statement had asked the counties to spend the Sh34.6 billion lying idle in the CBK vaults.The governors dismissed the remark as false.In a statement on Friday, Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) said the money Treasury CS Ukur Yatani referred to is already committed to projects.“The balances that the Cabinet Secretary referred to in his statement are monies already committed for ongoing or unfinished projects within the counties that are at different stages of completion,” the CoG said.Oparanya said once the projects are completed, all the Sh34.6 billion will be paid out.“For avoidance of doubt, we urge the National Treasury to expedite the release of the equitable share owed to county governments by the 15th of every month as the law clearly stipulates,” he added.Governors say counties need to pay salaries and provide services, and have threatened a shutdown of county operations.Yatani, in a statement on Thursday, said the Sh34 billion was part of the Sh133 billion released to counties for the financial year to June.He said this comprised Sh120 billion in equitable share and Sh13 billion as conditional grants – for health services.“We appeal to them to make full use of these funds in the meantime as further disbursements from the Exchequer are made in due course,” Yatani’s statement read.But governors said the total amount of equitable share transferred to the counties for 2020-21 is Sh93.9 billion.The amount, they said, does not cover the entire money owed for October, November, December and January.Oparanya said some counties are owed disbursements for September and October.“The total outstanding amount for all the 47 counties amounts to Sh89.6 billion.”County governments, the governors said, will still have to wait for their allocation for November and December, 2020, and now January, 2021.Edited by Josephine M.

398,NLC plans to set aside land for public projects,"The National Land Commission has said that it will set aside land for putting up public projects.Known as land banks, the parcels held by public or private institutions will be an asset to the commission and will be used for building public property in the future.On Wednesday NLC Commissioner Reginald Okumu said that the cost of acquiring land for government projects is extremely high.""Land banking is important for us given the limited amount of land for public projects,"" he told a stakeholder forum to discuss 2020-2025 NLC draft strategic plan.  The commission says it acquired land worth Sh38.273 billion for 77 public projects between 2013 and 2018. It received 693 historical land injustices claims, out of which 126 were admitted, investigated and determined.On the allocation of public land, it says it processed over 6,000 requests from counties for unalienated public land.Okumu said there is massive infrastructure, yet land is not available.He said even though land banking is a good concept, there is need for it to be approached with care.Okumu said previous administrations had a tendency to declare it as idle land, before reallocating it. He said the land might also be grabbed.Residents raised concerns that the delay in compulsory acquisition of land for projects was costly.Okumu said the commission will take an inventory of all the public land. He said land should be well secured and available when needed.Godfrey Kariuki from Kenya Electricity Transmission Company said they have a challenge in paying out landowners after NLC has done evaluation.""They (landowners) disagree after NLC has done valuation delaying some of the projects,"" he said.Johnson Muthoka also from Ketraco raised concerns at the rate at which people were subdividing land into small portions.NLC chairperson Gershom Otachi said the commission will in the next five years deliver in five key areas.These are management and administration of public land, use of land and security of land rights, revenue generation from land resources, land dispute resolution and strengthening the institution.""In this regard, we will focus on development and fast-track implementation of various frameworks to streamline land management and administration to effectively deal with various disputes relating to land use of natural resources,"" Otachi said.Otachi said the frameworks, identified as major gaps in land reforms will support the delivery of quality services to Kenyans while promoting better stewardship in land governance.NLC acting CEO Kabale Tache said she is happy the commission is fully constituted."
399,Sonko's letter withdrawing my nomination was blank: Kananu,"Impeached Governor Mike Sonko sent a ""blank"" document to the county Speaker claiming to withdraw the nomination of Anne Kananu as deputy governor, she has said.Speaking during her vetting on Friday, Kananu claimed that Sonko had sent her a blank document with no signature or stamp, alleging to have withdrawn her name as the nominee."" The purpose of that video was to show the public that he had sent the letter to me but I can confidently say the letter was blank with no authorising signature or stamp. The letter was not even dated December 7th,"" she said.Kananu was responding to Majority Leader Abdi Hassan Guyo who had questioned her on a video that went viral on Sonko having a conversation with Kananu on the alleged withdrawal letter.The Deputy Governor nominee also said her relationship with Sonko was purely professional for the past three years."" Former Governor Sonko was my boss whom I had a pure working relationship with. Under him I served as the Chief officer for Disaster management and also as acting chief officer for Water,"" Kananu added.Last week, Sonko said  that he withdrew Kananu’s name as deputy governor nominee, therefore 'blocking ' the assembly from proceeding with vetting.He claimed he wrote to the county Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura on December 7, 2020 withdrawing the name.However, Acting Governor and County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura in a sworn affidavit claimed that the"" withdrawal"" letter was forged by the usage of an alleged stamp and his office never received it.He highlighted that the purported withdrawal letter does not have any signature indicative of the person who has received the same as is the procedure.Consequently, he wrote a complaint letter to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations asking it to expeditiously investigate the matter."
400,Cop who shot friend released,"A police officer who shot his friend in Nyari Estate has been released on bail.Edgar Mokamba who pleaded to the charges on Tuesday was released on a Sh2 million bail.Mokamba who was not present in the virtual court was warned not to contact or interfere with witnesses in the case.Justice Daniel Ogembo said he had received information from Industrial area remand that Mokamba was in quarantine and that is why he was not before the court.Due to COVID-19, all accused persons who are remanded in any prison have to undergo 14 days quarantine before they are allowed to mingle with the other inmates.When he was charged his lawyer Danstan Omari had asked the court to allow Mokamba to be detained at Gigiri Police station.Omari said if he is taken to remand he has to go through quarantine and that will take time to get released.However, the prosecution said Gigiri has no facilities to continue holding the accused and asked the court to allow him to go to remand.Mokamba was taken to industrial area remand and a mention date was taken for the pre-bail report.On Friday, the prosecution told the court that they had received the report.Justice Ogembo said he was releasing him on bail even though he was away because his lawyers were in court and the prosecution was not opposed to bail.In the case, it is alleged that on December 29 last year at Nyari Estate he shot and killed Zachary Makuto.The state did not object to his release on bail but had asked the court to order for a pre-bail report so that they know where he will be staying during the pendency of the trial.Omari told the court that due to the good gesture by the prosecution not to object bail, Mokamba was willing to take a plea bargain.Omari said his client had accidentally shot the deceased and they will opt for plea bargaining at the right time.Mokamba who was arrested on December 30 is alleged to have fired 10 bullets in unclear circumstances on that night.Omari said his client is apologizing to the citizens for mishandling his gun saying the deceased was his personal friend for many years and he had no intention of killing him.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
401,[PHOTOS] Ruto meets ex-governor Rutto at Bomet rally,"Former Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto on Friday met DP William Ruto face-to-face for the first time since 2018.The two met before a rally in Bomet in what is seen as part of his elaborate strategy to ring-fence his Rift Valley bastion ahead of next year's election.This ushers a new partnership to consolidate the region.Ruto is in Bomet to commission several projects, hand over a bus to the National Super League side Silibwet FC and later preside over a fundraiser for boda boda Saccos in Sotik, among other events.The DP, who has fallen out with President Uhuru Kenyatta, is keen to diminish pockets of rebellion in his backyard as he prepares for a presidential run next year.During the Friday rally, Ruto reiterated his message that Kenya should not be divided on tribal lines.""There are people who were not happy Jubilee was uniting people and they hatched a plan to split the party so that Kenya is split. Even if they split the party, Kenya's unity will not be divided,"" he said.Ruto said meetings held at Jubilee's headquarters are only aimed at splitting the party.""To the point that the party cannot field a candidate for any by-election. Is that not a shame?""On Sunday, Rutto said he is ready to support the DP for the country’s top post “if we agree on principle”.“I am not in an alliance with anybody. After all, nobody has asked me to back him or her for presidency. If William seeks my support, we shall discuss, and if he supports the tenets CCM stands for – like devolving resources – then I will back him. There’s nothing personal,” he told the Sunday Nation.The DP has been facing a threat that could have chipped away a section of his main support base after Rutto last year led his Chama Cha Mashinani party in signing a cooperation agreement with Jubilee Party.When he signed the agreement, there was talk of major Cabinet changes that would have seen Rutto's entry into Uhuru's government in what would be a strategy to tame the DP in the Rift Valley.His change of heart to join the DP camp could puncture the Building Bridges Initiative campaigns in the Rift Valley given that the CCM party leader was a key point man of the process in the region.Kanu chairman Gideon Moi, the son of the country's second President who also hails from the Rift Valley, is working closely with Uhuru after the Independence party signed a coalition agreement with Jubilee.Rutto and Gideon had been seen as a political force that would have complicated the DP's efforts to put the region under lock and key ahead of next year's polls.Rutto's move to join the DP's camp is seen as part of his plan to recapture the Bomet governor's seat, which he lost to the late Joyce Laboso who was backed by Ruto in 2017.Rutto and the DP have had frosty relations since 2013 and in the lead-up to the 2017 polls. They last met face to face in 2018 at a public function at Siongiroi in Chepalungu, Bomet county. They have not been seeing eye to eye, a situation that could complicate Rutto's gubernatorial ambitions after staying in the political cold for five years.The former governor is set for another political duel in his bid to oust incumbent Hillary Barchok. A week ago, Rutto was greeted with unfriendly chants at Kuresoi in Nakuru where he had made a stopover.Angry youths demanded he join the wheelbarrow movement spearheaded by Ruto if he wanted to salvage his political future.“We love you but if you want to save your political career, work with the DP,” residents could be heard telling him from a video that went viral on social media.Rutto then left in a huff.It is this hostility that is believed to have made the once abrasive politician to agree to work with the DP.It, however, remains to be seen if their reunion will be sustained until 2022 given that the DP is under a fierce political onslaught from the President who has declared an end to the Kikuyu-Kalenjin hegemony.Last month, Rutto attended a Kanu party meeting in Bomet where he announced he will support Baringo Senator Gideon Moi should he declare his interest in the presidency.He later said he was quoted out of context after some CCM party officials, led by secretary general Zedekiah Kiprob Buzeki, took him head-on. Buzeki had accused Rutto of making decisions touching on the party without consulting them.In the run-up to the 2017 election, Rutto joined hands with the Nasa brigade before later ditching the camp and declaring support for Jubilee ahead of the repeat presidential election in October that year."
402,Anne Kananu vetting: Court declines to issue stay orders,"A court has dismissed a request by impeached Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to have a decision to allow vetting of the county's deputy governor nominee to proceed stayed.He has instead been allowed to file a formal complaint.This is after Justice Anthony Mrima on Friday dismissed applications by activist Okiyah Omtatah and Habil Kongo seeking to stop the vetting of Deputy Governor nominee Anne Kananu.Omtatah had asked the court to suspend its decision to allow them appeal the matter at the Appellate court.The same was supported by lawyer Wilfred Nyamu acting for Sonko. Kongo (an aspiring Governor) also sought the same.Omtatah and Kongo had challenged the entire process of Kananu's nomination.The judge said the court is not convinced that the petitioners (Omatah and Kongo) have demonstrated any prejudice if the order is granted. ""There's no proof Kananu will be approved after vetting.""The Attorney General represented by Paul Nyamodi opposed the application by Nyamu seeking stay.In a brief rejoinder, Nyamu said the order made by the court is appealable.""The process we endeavour to stop is set to happen at 11am as shown in the Gazette notice. The court has already found there's an arguable case so we are entitled to appeal. No prejudice will be suffered if you suspend your decision even if it's for five days to enable us move to the court of appeal.""Nyamu said he cannot file a formal application to arrest a process that is set to proceed at 11am.However, Mrima said, ""I have considered the application. The best way forward is for Sonko to file a formal application. As a result, stay is declined."""
403,Museveni takes early lead in Uganda elections,"Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has taken a significant early lead in the presidential race, according to preliminary results released by the electoral commission on Friday morning.Museveni has garnered 1,536,205 votes (65.02%), while his main rival Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, has 647,146 votes (27.39%) from 8,310 polling stations.The country has a total of 34,684 polling stations.Wine has alleged there was widespread fraud and violence during Thursday's poll but gave no details of his accusations.Uganda's government has described the election as peaceful.On Thursday, the chairman of Uganda's electoral commission, Simon Mugenyi Byabakama, hailed the fiercely contested presidential and parliamentary as a success.At a news conference in the capital Kampala, he said Ugandans had turned up in large numbers and voted peacefully in spite of the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier ballot boxes arrived late at polling stations and biometric voter verification machines failed. But Mr Byabakama said these were just isolated incidents.Wine had said some of his polling agents had been arrested.He's challenging Museveni who's been in power for nearly 35 years.Museveni said he would accept the result if there were no irregularities."
404,Former MP aspirant vows to turn tide against Kalonzo for Ruto,"Politician Moses Banda has shelved his ambition for the Kitui Central parliamentary seat to popularise Deputy President William Ruto in Kitui county.   In a press release on Tuesday, Banda, who is Kitui Central Jubilee Party chairman, said his agenda is to ensure Ukambani has a stake in the hustler nation government to be formed after the 2022 presidential poll.Kitui is the home of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and his Narc counterpart Charity Ngilu, who is also Kitui governor. Both politicians enjoy immense support  in the area and Banda will have to be tactical and calculative to turn the tide against the duo in their backyard.“I am thus embarking on a blitz throughout Kitui county and many parts of Ukambani to seek to mobilise and place the Kamba community in a position where it will have a say in the next government under Hon William Ruto as President,” Banda said.He plans to work in solidarity with like-minded leaders such former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, now UDA party chairman, in ensuring the Kamba nation cements their place in the Ruto camp.Banda is also the Kitui hustler nation coordinator. In 2017, he unsuccessfully ran for Kitui Central MP. He said in his statement that he had resolved to pursue a community agenda as opposed to personal ambitions.“I have chosen to take the lead and will now focus my energy to campaign and coordinate Dr WS Ruto's presidential bid in Kitui county as I focus on delivering the ultimate price—the Ruto presidency—in order to position our community and county centrally in government,” he said.The politician expressed concern that for the last 10 years the Kamba community has been out of government because of blind loyalty to the supposed community kingpin ""who has made a number of political missteps"".“It is worth noting that the Kamba community has been out of government for the past 10 years. The reason has been due to the selfishness and the ego of the so-called Kamba kingpin.” He advised that in the current fast-changing political landscape in Kenya, the Kamba community needed to position itself strategically to reap big in government after next year's election..“It is thus my considered opinion that as members of the Kamba community, we should be politically apt to take advantage of the hustler nation's change blowing across the country to take our rightful place in being part of the government in 2022.”"
405,"Ritual killing? Embu pupil says he slaughtered cousin, drank blood","A Embu boy, 16, led police in the search and recovery of the body of his four-year-old cousin he allegedly murdered and drank his blood in a suspected ritual sacrifice.  The Standard 8 pupil on Wednesday led detectives to River Thuci where they recovered the body of Brayden Mutwiri. It had decomposed beyond recognition after remaining in water for weeks. Mutwiri went missing in late December from his home in Kavengero, Mbeere North.The suspect and one of his accomplices were arrested on Monday and held at Siakago police station. He directed the police to the river where the body was found stuck between two rocks.Speaking to the press at the scene, their uncle Nephat Nyaga said the suspect narrated how he and his accomplices murdered the boy, drank his blood, then threw his body into the river.The suspect and his accomplices lured the boy as he played at home and took him to the river. Area chief Charles Njeru told the press that the boy mysteriously disappeared from home in late December and residents had been searching for him since.Njeru said the bereaved family will have to wait for the postmortem result to ascertain that the body is Mutwiri's.The local administrator said this was the second incident of a missing child being found dead in the river. The first was a girl who went missing and her body retrieved from the river three months ago.Njeru cautioned residents against settling their family grudges by attacking and killing children, urging them instead to follow the legal procedures of resolving disputes.Residents condemned the killing and called for quick investigations so the killers are brought to book. Purity Muringo said parents from the area now live in fear for the security of their schoolchildren. She said lives are at stake. Muringo called for thorough investigations to unravel the mysterious killings of innocent children."
406,Ruto’s 2022 bid in limbo as Uhuru jolts DP’s game plan,"Deputy President William Ruto is increasingly walking a political tightrope with his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, clearly laying a grand scheme to vanquish his State House run.The President, who has at most 18 months left in his final term, has launched an aggressive campaign to block his deputy's bid, leaving him with limited options.Just last week, Uhuru in no holds barred remarks threw his deputy under the bus, suggesting an end to the Kikuyu-Kalenjin dominion of the presidency.Uhuru's shocking and dramatic pronouncements jolted the DP's succession game plan and at the same time handled key opposition figures a political lifeline ahead of the 2022 General Election.Ruto, a Kalenjin, has declared his interest in succeeding President Kenyatta in 2022. He, however, faces major hurdles in his quest, with political bigwigs uniting against his ambitions.The Nasa trio of ODM leader Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka are backing the political manoeuvres to stop Ruto's State House march.For instance, the three leaders have forged rare political horse trading that would see their parties close ranks with Jubilee to take on the DP in upcoming by-elections in various parts of the country.The ruling Jubilee Party — in which Ruto lost grip after Uhuru launched a vicious purge on his allies — has pulled out of the Machakos, Matungu and Kabuchai by-elections.This is meant to boost chances of Wiper to capture Machakos and Ford Kenya to retain the Kabuchai parliamentary seat as well as ANC to recapture the Matungu slot.The plan is to deflate Ruto's hustler nation movement that is basking in full glory of the decisive victory in Msambweni parliamentary race in which Faisar Bader, the DP's choice, trounced ODM's Omar Boga.The elaborate schemes have pushed the DP into a tight corner with his presidential ambitions facing a major threat from the united front of the Nasa trio.On Thursday, ex-South Mugirango MP and Kenya National Congress Party leader Manson Nyamweya told the Star that Ruto's bravado has boomeranged as his ambitions “go up in smoke.'“It is no secret that the President is keen on pursuing a different succession plan that obviously excludes the Deputy President from the matrix,"" Nyamwenya said.He asked the DP to come to terms with ""the fact that he is a lone ranger"" in his battle to succeed Uhuru because of his antagonistic nature of politics.“The DP's presidential prospects have gone up in smoke because he has created a lot of political enemies and continues to undermine the President's agenda,” he said.Uhuru's last week's declaration that Kenya has had enough of the Kikuyu and Kalenjin presidency is seen as part of the political scheme aimed at frustrating Ruto's bid.Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika, an ally of the DP, said the President's remarks were 'tribal' and aimed at further frustrating the DP's quest for the presidency.“It was indeed sad coming from the President who is supposed to be the symbol of national unity. It was wrong to say that just because the President and his father have ruled, there is no chance for any Kikuyu to lead this country,” Kihika said.Tangatanga brigade that backs Ruto has lashed out at the President, maintaining that his statements are an indication of the state's panic following DP's growing influence across the country.However, analysts opine that Uhuru's pronouncement is an indication he will abandon Ruto from his succession matrix and pick a different heir.With Uhuru having technically ruled out Ruto and Kanu leader Senator Gideon Moi — who also hails from the Kalenjin community — from his succession plans, the President appears to be looking at the Nasa trio for a presidential candidate. There is speculation that Uhuru is determined to have the Nasa leaders stick together and  then share the leadership spoils proposed in the BBI amendment proposal.The statement is also likely to elbow Ruto from Mt Kenya and give the three an avenue to penetrate the region.Mudavadi, will work closely with Raila to annihilate the DP out of western Kenya.Political risk Analyst Dismas Mokua admitted  the President could be working on a programme to ensure the Nasa principals remained an item to ward off Ruto's offensive.“The President is keen to keep the principals united to get the necessary ammunition to take on Ruto and vanquish his State House run,"" Mokua said, adding that if the three go separate ways, then Ruto might be unbeatable.The DP's fortunes in Mt Kenya region, where his support is said to be a concern to Uhuru's power men, faces a major onslaught from an imminent charm offensive from the President.Uhuru is planning to reclaim the BBI narrative and strengthen his camp in a bid to vanquish Ruto.In his Central backyard, the President will tout BBI as the panacea of their problems and cobble a political machine to wipe out Ruto's footprints.There are fears Mt Kenya will be out of the presidency for decades after Uhuru's reign, a scenario that might leave the vote-rich region out of state power.The expanded government under the BBI proposals with at least five key slots at the helm of the Executive is expected to offer the region a silver lining.This is the reason Uhuru is launching an aggressive campaign to neutralise Ruto, a scheme that would further complicate his Mt Kenya fortunes.Fresh from last week's stinging rebuke that appeared to puncture Ruto's ambitions, Uhuru is set to begin marketing the BBI in his  backyard.The strategy is aimed at reversing the DP's hustler nation narrative and reframe the conversation around the BBI document's benefits for the region ahead of the referendum.Already, the President's allies have launched grassroots campaigns in the region, with MPs taking charge of their respective jurisdictions to market BBI.Last week, about 41 elected MPs held a brainstorming session at a hotel in Thika where they crafted a scheme to turn the tables on Ruto.Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu told the Star that the President is expected to tour the region sometime later after the elected leaders marshal up the grassroots.“We have developed a programme that will see elected leaders take charge of the BBI in their respective constituencies,” Ngunjiri said.According to the Kieleweke wing pioneer, there is concerted efforts from Uhuru's allies to ring-fence the region and enhance the BBI fortunes.“The plan is to make all our constituencies BBI strongholds,' Ngunjiri said.Central leaders have been raising concerns that BBI is unpopular in Mt Kenya following Ruto's ferocious incursions with the Tangatanga faction of Jubilee.He is leading a national charm offensive against the country's elite political families, a strategy that is seen to be working to his advantage at the expense of Uhuru's plans.However, the President's camp, which has been rattled by Ruto's growing influence in his backyard, is now ready to roll back the rhetoric to promote BBI.The vote rich region is very critical in defining Uhuru successor, with key leaders, among them Raila, relying in its backing to boost their 2022 ambitions.While Raila is yet to publicly declare what would be the fifth stab at the presidency, he is said to have kicked a programme to revamp his ODM party to position it ahead of the polls.Suba North MP Millie Odhiambo on Thursday said ODM is ready with their candidate Raila to take on Ruto next year.“For us in ODM we are ready and Raila is our candidate,” Odhiambo said.The vocal MP warned that Ruto should be ready for a bruising battle in next year'e elections.“We are prepared for a mother of all political fights and I want to say that the future of this country is within the hands of the President and the former Prime minister under the handshake arrangement,” she said."
407,Registrar blocks registration of at least 176 new parties,"The Registrar of Political Parties has declined requests to register at least 176 political parties, some mirroring DP William Ruto's hustler nation narrative.While the hundreds sought name clearance, only 21 jumped the hurdles and  managed to receive certificates of provisional registration awaiting further scrutiny.Documents from the office show it could have nipped in the bud suspect outfits fronted on tribal or social platforms. Of the 176 parties that sought registration, at least 10 proposed names that mirror Ruto's hustler nation ideologies and campaign slogans.They included the Jubilee Asili Party, the Hustlers and Achievers Party of Kenya, the Hustlers Alliance Party of Kenya, Hustle, the Strive and Achieve Party of Kenya and the National Alliance of Hustlers and Achievers Party of Kenya.Others were National Party of Hustlers and Achievers of Kenya, and Hustlers and Ground Masses Party of Kenya.However, the registrar rejected the hustler names on the basis that they seek to unite on social status, threatening the country's peaceful co-existence.DP Ruto, who vowed in 2013 that Jubilee was formed to end the culture of tribal parties, has embarked on a charm offensive and is spearheading creation of regional parties.The DP has fashioned himself as the real hustler from Sugoi who rose from a roadside chicken seller to become the country's second in command and has whipped the youth to reject the scions of Kenya's privileged families.After a rigorous legal and physical verification process, only three parties managed to get full registration, pushing the country's parties to 71.Party of Economic Democracy, The Service Party and the National Ordinary People Empowerment Union are the only parties that met all the statutory requirements and were fully registered.The Party of Development and Reform managed to complete its change of name to United Democratic Party, an outfit also associated with Ruto.A party given provisional status must be subject to a rigorous process by the registrar's' office to ensure it has physical offices, verified details of governing body officials and membership data.Many parties that seek provisional registration even after going through the name search stage, fail to comply with the strict provisions of the law on membership and even physical offices.Among those rejected were names seen as promoting registration of parties based on social groupings, an element that goes against the principles for registration of parties in KenyaThe registrar also declined proposed registration on the basis of resemblance in colours and symbols.Some politicians seeking registration of political parties through name searches saw their requests turned down based on the fact that their proposed names do not 'make meaning'.On Tuesday, ODM leader Raila Odinga warned against what he termed a dangerous push by politicians to form ethnic parties, saying they threaten the country's stability and entrenches tribalism.“Let us move away from negative ethnic politics. Let us not talk about tribal unity. For example, (some will say) let us first unite as Kikuyus before we go and unite with Merus and Embus to become Gema, then come and unite with the rest of Kenyans,” Raila said."
408,IEBC denies sabotaging BBI signature verification,"The electoral agency has dismissed claims it was sabotaging the verification of signatures to back the proposed Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati termed the sentiments by Suna East MP Junet Mohamed – a strong Raila ally – as completely false and unfortunate.He told the Star there was no way the commission could frustrate or sabotage a process that falls within its mandate.“Signature verification is part of the IEBC's mandate as articulated in Article 257 of the Constitution and therefore the commission cannot sabotage it.”“Additionally, the commission has deployed its best human resources to manage the process,” Chebukati said.At least 400 clerks are engaged in the verification.He said two BBI co-chairs attested to the commission’s capacity during their visit to the Bomas of Kenya on January 8 to assess progress.Junet, who is BBI secretariat co-chairman, said they suspected the delay was deliberate.The lawmaker termed it an attempt by the commission to scuttle the process, saying the grumbles by the commission over cash were part of the alleged scheme.Following the turn of events, Junet cautioned the IEBC not to open doors to a fresh round of protests to push for the removal of the commissioners.“We see this as a form of sabotaging the BBI. They should know that we are not tired. We know how we removed the Issack Hassan team. If they want us to take that route, they better tell us.”He said they will stage protests against the commission if the signatures are not ready by January 30.The IEBC acknowledged having experienced intermittent internet challenges on January 12 at Bomas, which was among issues cited by Junet as pointing to the inordinate delay.Chebukati said the internet glitch was occasioned by a system upgrade of bandwidth and power surges.“However, the issue was brought to the attention of the Bomas of Kenya management and the same addressed to our satisfaction,” he said.Chebukati spoke following lamentations by BBI proponents over the slow process of the verification of the 4.2 million signatures.One million signatures are required to back the BBI bill before it is subjected to a vote by the 47 county assemblies.The next phase of the BBI depends on the outcome of the verification process.BBI promoters say they have no luxury of time owing to the tight timelines accosting the constitutional change campaign.President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga’s camps are anticipating that the referendum be held by June.Chebukati assured the stakeholders and the general public that the IEBC was “committed to ensuring that the process is completed within the shortest time possible.”There was a slow start to the verification process after the IEBC ran into cash constraints which delayed the start of the verification process.The commission earlier said they would be slower after the Treasury allocated Sh97.3 million for the listing.In its January 8 update on the verification, the IEBC said 544,624 records had been captured – being above 50 per cent of the required one million signatures.“The commission would like to assure all stakeholders and the general public that it is committed to ensuring the verification is carried out in a transparent and accountable manner,” IEBC said then."
409,Ex-governor Rutto to join DP's camp at Bomet event,"Ex-Bomet governor Isaac Rutto will on Friday make a comeback to DP William Ruto's camp, handing his former ally-turned-foe a boost in efforts to consolidate his backyard.The DP is set to receive Rutto during an event to be held in Bomet in what is seen as part of his elaborate strategy to ring-fence his Rift Valley bastion ahead of next year's election.He will be in Bomet to commission several projects, hand over a bus to the National Super League side Silibwet FC and later preside over a fundraiser for boda boda Saccos in Sotik, among other events.A Rutto aide confirmed to the Star that the former governor will meet the DP face to face for the first time since 2018, ushering in a new partnership to consolidate the region.The DP, who has fallen out with President Uhuru Kenyatta, is keen to diminish pockets of rebellion in his backyard as he prepares for a presidential run next year.“The former governor will be there to welcome the DP,” the aide told the Star, keen not to divulge details.When asked if the two leaders had closed ranks, the aide said they are in talks.“They are discussing various issues affecting the community. Top of it is how to unite the people,” the aide noted.On Sunday, Rutto said he is ready to support the DP for the country’s top post “if we agree on principle”.“I am not in an alliance with anybody. After all, nobody has asked me to back him or her for presidency. If William seeks my support, we shall discuss, and if he supports the tenets CCM stands for – like devolving resources – then I will back him. There’s nothing personal,” he told the Sunday Nation.The DP has been facing a threat that could have chipped away a section of his main support base after Rutto last year led his Chama Cha Mashinani party in signing a cooperation agreement with Jubilee Party.When he signed the agreement, there was talk of major Cabinet changes that would have seen Rutto's entry into Uhuru's government in what would be a strategy to tame the DP in the Rift Valley.His change of heart to join the DP camp could puncture the Building Bridges Initiative campaigns in the Rift Valley given that the CCM party leader was a key point man of the process in the region.Kanu chairman Gideon Moi, the son of the country's second President who also hails from the Rift Valley, is working closely with Uhuru after the Independence party signed a coalition agreement with Jubilee.Rutto and Gideon had been seen as a political force that would have complicated the DP's efforts to put the region under lock and key ahead of next year's polls.Rutto's move to join the DP's camp is seen as part of his plan to recapture the Bomet governor's seat, which he lost to the late Joyce Laboso who was backed by Ruto in 2017.Rutto and the DP have had frosty relations since 2013 and in the lead-up to the 2017 polls. They last met face to face in 2018 at a public function at Siongiroi in Chepalungu, Bomet county. They have not been seeing eye to eye, a situation that could complicate Rutto's gubernatorial ambitions after staying in the political cold for five years.The former governor is set for another political duel in his bid to oust incumbent Hillary Barchok. A week ago, Rutto was greeted with unfriendly chants at Kuresoi in Nakuru where he had made a stopover.Angry youths demanded he join the wheelbarrow movement spearheaded by Ruto if he wanted to salvage his political future.“We love you but if you want to save your political career, work with the DP,” residents could be heard telling him from a video that went viral on social media.Rutto then left in a huff.It is this hostility that is believed to have made the once abrasive politician to agree to work with the DP.It, however, remains to be seen if their reunion will be sustained until 2022 given that the DP is under a fierce political onslaught from the President who has declared an end to the Kikuyu-Kalenjin hegemony.Last month, Rutto attended a Kanu party meeting in Bomet where he announced he will support Baringo Senator Gideon Moi should he declare his interest in the presidency.He later said he was quoted out of context after some CCM party officials, led by secretary general Zedekiah Kiprob Buzeki, took him head-on. Buzeki had accused Rutto of making decisions touching on the party without consulting them.In the run-up to the 2017 election, Rutto joined hands with the Nasa brigade before later ditching the camp and declaring support for Jubilee ahead of the repeat presidential election in October that year."
410,Ministry projects 42 million bags of maize harvest,"The country is expecting 42 million bags of maize from this year's harvest, the  Agriculture PS says.This will be a decline of two million bags from last year’s 44 million bags. Principal Secretary Hamadi Boga said even though the short rains were problematic at the beginning, they started picking up early this month. He said this is good for the short rains crops.“Things are not so bad in some parts of Voi, Ukambani and parts of Kwale. There are some rains and the crops will be able to recover,” he said.He spoke to the Star in interview on Thursday.  Boga said the current stability of national food security is due to the average to above-average 2020 long rains harvest that has been going on in most non-arid and semi-arid counties.In the ASAL counties, the range land resources and livestock production conditions are still good, with livestock prices still above the long-term average.Boga said harvesting of maize is going on in the major growing zones in the North Rift, parts of South Rift (Nakuru, Kericho, Nandi) and the Western region.“These regions have been experiencing heavy rains, which may lead to higher post-harvest losses,” he said.Timothy Njagi, a senior researcher from Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development – Egerton University, said the rain was favourable for both the long and short seasons and the country’s maize production will be good.“We are likely to get an estimated 38 million bags of maize for the long rains season and another four million bags for the short rains season. This will take us through to June,” he said.Njagi said there is a need to monitor post-harvest losses, though it is likely to be lower than 2019-20 when there was flooding and the onset of the desert locust invasion.The Kenya Meteorological Department and IGAD short rains forecast indicated low rainfall in most parts of the Coast, Eastern, Central and Northeastern regions.The PS noted that up to the end of October 2020, the regions with poor short rains forecasts completed planting of the short rains crops, and that so far, the crops are still doing well.“During the reported period, desert locust was reported in parts of the coastal region. However, the locust response unit reported that adequate measures are available to ensure the locusts do not adversely affect the short rains crops in the affected regions,” he said."
411,"Spend Sh34 billion lying idle in your accounts, Yatani tells counties","Treasury CS Ukur Yatani has challenged county governments to utilise the Sh34.6 billion lying idle in their CBK accounts.But Yatani admitted disbursement to the devolved units has delayed.In a statement, responding to Council of Governors that has threatened to sue the Treasury for delaying the release of county cash, Yatani said balances at the CBK show the counties are yet to utilise the cash.“Nonetheless, the National Treasury notes that as at January 13, 2021, the balances of county governments at CBK stand at Sh34.6 billion and appeals to them to make full use of these funds,” reads a part of the statement.The statement will likely trigger reactions from the governors who have been critical of the Treasury for allegedly withholding their cash.In a letter to Yatani on Monday, CoG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya lamented that the Treasury is yet to release Sh94.7 billion to counties.He said the counties have not received disbursements for four months, October, November, December and January affecting operations and subjecting workers to suffering.Oparanya said the delay has hindered service delivery in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic when the county governments are expected to be at the frontline in offering health services.He copied the letter to Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakango, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and his Senate counterpart Kenneth Lusaka.“The delay in disbursement of these funds has negatively affected lives of county government civil servants and service delivery in the following aspects; failure of payment to contractors, failure of development budget implementation and failure of submission of statutory deduction,” he said.In his statement, Yatani admitted the delays in disbursement of the cash to the counties.He, however, differed with the governors that the cash has fallen behind by four months.“However, due to the adverse effects of Covid-19 and the subsequent containment measures that have slowed down the pace of economic activities, the disbursements to county governments are falling behind by two months,” he said.So far, the CS said, the Treasury has released Sh133 billion to the devolved units for the 2020-2021 financial year.Of the transfers, Sh12.02 billion has been disbursed as part of the equitable share due to the counties and Sh13 billion as conditional grants.However, according to a report by the Controller of Budget on the status of Exchequer release obtained by the Star, the Treasury had disbursed to the counties Sh126.05 billion out of Sh373 billion as at Monday this week.This is an equivalent of 34 per cent of their total annual allocation.Yatani expressed optimism that the balance will be disbursed in due course with the opening up of the economy and the reversal of the tax relief measures.“The Treasury expects revenue collection to improve from the current Quarter and will prioritise disbursements to county governments with a view to clearing the arrears,” he said. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
412,Firing striking health workers is no solution — doctors,"Doctors have asked governors to avoid sackings or firing threats and embrace dialogue when dealing with striking health workers.The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union said the country is already suffering from an acute shortage of personnel and firing more will only worsen the situation. Acting KMPDU secretary-general Chibanzi Mwachonda said it is illegal to employ brinkmanship in dealing with the ongoing strike.""The strikes in the health sector are disputes that should be handled through the established International Labour Organization conventions on dispute resolutions,"" Mwachonda said.""The welfare, safety, health, terms and conditions of work of doctors including remuneration are paramount in the delivery of healthcare services to the common citizen."" Mwachonda called on the Council of Governors to embrace the compensation package on group life and comprehensive medical insurance under NHIF for compensation of families of healthcare workers who die while treating Covid-19 patients. ""KMPDU welcomes the call for social dialogue and reiterates that this is the spirit upon which the nationwide strike was called off on December 24. Intimidation, threats and harassment of our members and other health sector workers will plunge the country into further crisis amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.""Nurses and clinical officers in 34 counties went on strike on December 7. They demand higher allowances, adequate personal protective equipment, comprehensive medical insurance cover and an end to salary delays.But the governors say they are some of the best paid civil servants in the counties and, perhaps, do not deserve any more pay. Any pay rise is untenable and will distort counties payroll.Some counties such as Kisumu and Mombasa have fired striking healthcare workers or scrapped them from the payroll.Last week, the nurses and the Ministry of Health signed a return-to-work formula, which was rejected by governors.Kenya National Union of Nurses' secretary-general Seth Panyako said the RTWF gives all nurses a 500 per cent increase in nursing allowance to Sh15,000.The Kenya Health Service Delivery Indicator Survey 2018 Report shows a rampant shortage of staff in public facilities.The survey, conducted by the World Bank and Kenyan government also noted rampant absenteeism of 60.7 per cent by doctors followed by nurses (54.5 per cent) and clinical officers (49.5 per cent).The governors have maintained they will not reinstate sacked health workers even through a return-to-work formula.They said several courts have also issued orders to suspend the strike, and as is, the strike is not protected in law. (edited by o. owino)"
413,One in every 37 women in Kenya dies while giving birth,"One in every 37 pregnant women in Kenya dies due to complications while giving birth, data from the Ministry of Health shows.This means that 362 out of 100,000 women die.Speaking on Thursday during the launch of the Kenya reproductive, maternal,  newborn and child health country platform at a Nairobi hotel, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said that is an important issue.She said on Wednesday, four people died from Covid-19 in the country, yet 20 women died while giving birth.“We need to make the necessary investments and be able to ask key questions on why are we having these deaths especially because of the increased resources that have been availed since the MDG goals came to an end about 10 years ago,” Mwangangi said.It was also revealed that only 10 per cent of children are dewormed while 5 per cent of children under five have been given vitamin A supplements.Similarly, 26 per cent of children in the country are stunted.“This means that out six million children 26 per cent of them will never realise the full mental capacity because when you are stunted it affects your cognition and your mental ability,” the CAS said.Stunting has been attributed to several factors such as poverty, food security, access, social and cultural barriers, how parents feed their children and also factors related to resource investment.The Kenya reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health country platform involves a composition of all key stakeholders who are part of the teams that help to progress reproductive health services within the country.They are drawn from the ministries of Education, Labour, Agriculture, Health as well as development partners such as UNFPA, WHO, county governments and the private sector.The key role of the platform will be to advocate for reproductive and maternal health services in Kenya whose key role will be to coordinate and ensure there is intersectional alignment when it comes to resource investment in reproductive health in Kenya.According to Mwangangi, the platform will also work towards a realisation of more resources for mothers and children, and track all the health indicators attached to mothers, children and adolescents.“I am glad we now know where we need to invest, where we have challenges when it comes to delivery and ensuring that our mothers are getting obstetric services, we know the complications killing mothers so we are auctioning and ensuring that we are putting in place interventions that will ensure our mothers are safe‚” she said.The platform will also ensure county and national governments can implement their nutrition action plans. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
414,Over 20 ECD centres closed due to flooding in Naivasha,"More than 20 early childhood education and development centres in Kihoto estate have been closed down after they were flooded by rising waters of Lake Naivasha.About 1,000 children have been left without classes, with some relocated to public schools in the estate. Nearly 15,000 people have been displaced by the swelling lake.Disaster Management chief officer Ann Njenga said at least 20 private schools in Kihoto estate had been forced to close down due to the flooding.“The closure of the private schools have caused another crisis as there is only one public school in this estate and we are working with the Ministry of Education to address this,” she said.She termed the situation in the estate as critical, adding that the county was keen to relocate and resettle genuine landlords.“Water levels in the lake have continued to rise, displacing more families, flooding schools and latrines and putting the lives of area residents in danger,” she said.Speaking after distributing relief food to the affected families, she said that the department was working closely with the public health officials to contain disease outbreak.“The county is committed to assisting those affected by the floods and soon the governor will be rolling out a project to resettle affected landlords,” she said.Resident Zachariah Kamau said that the most affected landlords were retired government officers who had used their savings to construct rental houses in the estate.He noted that the majority were now homeless and without a source of income while others who had loans could not service them due to the flooding crisis.Dickson Kimani said that many of the families could not afford to pay rent or get school fees for their children.“Many of the parents lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic and apart from flooding wildlife have invaded this estate putting our lives in great danger,” he said.(edited by o. owino)"
415,Ex-Laikipia East MP denies stealing title deed,"Former Laikipia East MP Antony Kimaru was on Thursday charged with stealing a title deed for land worth Sh18.5 million.Kimaru was accused of stealing the title deed of parcel LR. 10422/13 Nanyuki township belonging to George Odinga and David Silverstein, the executors of the late Livia Lepoer Trench.The former lawmaker allegedly committed the offence on August 5, 2016, at the Ministry of Lands headquarters in Nairobi.He also faces another count of fraudulently making an agreement of sale of parcel LR. 10422/13 Nanyuki township dated August 3, 2009, purporting to be genuine and issued by Mwangi Kariuki advocate.The court heard that Kimaru also unlawfully uttered an agreement of sale of land to Silas Kimeli, the deputy registrar ELC High Court Nyeri, on February 5, 2020. He is further accused of procuring the registration of the land by falsely pretending that it had been lawfully transferred to him by the executors.Kimaru denied the charges before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku.Through lawyer Gregory Ndege, he pleaded with the court for lenient bond terms and copies of witness statements.The prosecution has listed 16 witnesses to testify in the case.He was released on Sh300,000 bail or Sh1 million bond.The case will be mentioned on January 28."
416,"All grabbed public land will be reclaimed, EACC vows","The Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission on Thursday said it will continue partnering with the National Land Commission to recover all the illegally acquired public land.EACC Chairman Eliud Wabukala said information-sharing is going to be critical between EACC and NLC because of the criminal element that keeps coming in the land sector.“Cooperation and partnership especially in investigations are key so that we can enhance recovery and reregistration of illegally acquired land,” he said.Speaking during a virtual session where the NLC took chairpersons of constitutional offices through the 2020-2025 strategic plan, Wabukala warned that all the illegally acquired public land will be recovered.The plan will guide the commission's operations for the next five years.NLC chairman Gershom Otachi, CEO Kabale Tache took part in the session.Wabukala said land is prone to corruption and unethical conduct because it is an important commodity.He urged NLC to incorporate a risk assessment EACC did with the commission and the Ministry of Land in 2016 into the strategic plan.Public institutions are expected to undertake the corruption risk assessment.They are supposed to conduct an assessment and develop a plan to mitigate risks and loopholes in the legal and policy environment; regulations, processes, procedures and practices guiding the core mandate of such institutions.Wabukala said there is a need to review of codes of conduct in the land sector.“We need to have corruption control measures. We urge the management at NLC to continue empowering corruption prevention committees, integrity assurance officers, internal audit functions as critical elements in helping to bolster the performance of the commission,” he said.He praised NLC’s strategic plan saying it is a very important document that looks very progressive.EACC has in recent past recovered several public properties before handing them over to Bomet and Nakuru counties.The 11 public properties were recovered through alternative dispute resolution mechanism and judicial processes.The properties, with an estimated value of more than Sh 780 million, comprised: 140 acres of Naivasha Municipality land valued at Sh 490 million that had been reserved for research; two blocks of land belonging to Nakuru Municipality with an estimated value of Sh 116.2 million.Others were 27 public officers residences and two parcels of land reserved for a survey camp for the Department of Survey in Nakuru; two blocks of land valued at Sh 4.2 million reserved for the construction of a stadium in Sotik township in Bomet; and Sh 150 million Postal Corporation land which was disrupted during an irregular alienation process in Nakuru town along Kenyatta Avenue.NLC chairperson Gershom Otachi said land reform in the country is not a domain for one institution.“This plan, therefore, underpins the need for meaningful stakeholder engagement, collaboration and partnership,” Otachi said.Acting CEO Kabale Tache said the monitoring of the strategic plan will be done systematically and continuously.“We are committed to secure land rights, manage public land and exercise oversight on the use of land and natural resources for the benefit of all Kenyans,” she said.The strategic plan has five key result areas: management and administration of public land, use of land and security of land rights, revenue generation from land resources, land dispute resolution and institutional strengthening. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
417,Maraga: Uhuru should be impeached,"Retired Chief Justice David Maraga says President Uhuru Kenyatta should have been impeached for failing to appoint 41 judges recommended to him, adding he fell short in his his constitutional duties.Maraga said the President has failed to uphold a constitutional duty placed upon him which could warrant him being impeached.""There are three court orders directing the President and even giving him a time frame and he has not appointed them. As far as I'm concerned, that is a violation of his constitutional duty,"" Maraga said during an interview with Citizen Tv on Thursday.""In fact I should say if he was in other countries, the President would be impeached for that. Because he swore to defend and uphold the Constitution.""Maraga said that a scenario like that has never happened in Kenya's jurisdiction hence the Constitution continues to be disregarded.When asked what should be the next course of action now that the judges are yet to be appointed, Maraga said MPs should impeach the President to protect the Constitution.""I believe there is a provision for which Parliament if it wanted to can use to impeach the President so that everybody is held accountable,"" he said.This comes two weeks after the High Court ruled that Uhuru can be sued while in office if he violates the Constitution.Justices George Dulu, William Musyoka and James Wakiaga ruled that Uhuru does not enjoy absolute immunity from a civil suit while in office.In the case, Katiba Institute sued the President for failing to appoint 41 judges recommended for hiring by the Judicial Services Commission. Maraga also said the National Intelligence Service did not reveal to him the integrity issues it had with some of the candidates which made the President not appoint the judges.He said that made him proceed to insist on their appointment, lest a loophole was created for manipulation of the Judiciary.Maraga said the failure to reveal the integrity issues made him consider that there might have been some who did not want judges appointed for personal reasons."
418,Uhuru's 'revisit' comment was definitely implemented - Maraga,"Retired CJ David Maraga says the President actualised his threat to 'revisit' the Judiciary.""When the president made that statement, I thought it was just something said in the spur of a moment. But subsequently, when you see some things you say wait a minute, this would ordinarily not be done,"" Maraga said during an exit interview with Citizen TV on Thursday night.Maraga retired from his position at the helm of the Judiciary on Tuesday.On the 'revisit' comment, Maraga cited drastic budget cuts for the Judiciary as one of the indications of the infamous remark by President Uhuru Kenyatta coming to play.""The development vote (a name for the Judiciary budget) was normally about Sh1-2 billion per year, however, after that we were given Sh50 million,"" Maraga said.He further said there was a cold reception from the president that made it obvious there was something amiss.Uhuru made the 'revisit' statement after the Supreme Court overturned the results of the 2017 General Election.   ""We shall revisit this thing. We clearly have a problem...Who even elected you?  We have a problem and we must fix it,"" he said with anger written all over his face.Since then, the relationship between the President and the Judiciary has been thorny and frosty.The two have had on and off turf wars, with Chief Justice David Maraga accusing the Executive of interfering with the independence of the Judiciary.Maraga accused the Executive of being behind a plot to undermine the administration of justice by denying the Judiciary funds.But in response, the President asked Maraga to “think out of the box” on its use of resources."
419,Voter wants vetting of Nyaribo's nominees halted for lack of diversity,"A Nyamira resident has asked a court to block the vetting of Governor Amos Nyaribo's nominees to the executive because there is no representation of special groups. Vincent Omao said the governor did not follow the law in making the appointments and excluded the youth, persons with disability and marginalised groups.Through lawyer Herman Bunde, Omao wants the court to stop the vetting of the nominees for the time being.“Pending hearing and determination of the case, the court be pleased to grant interim orders of injunction restraining the governor and the county of assembly from continuing with the process of nomination, vetting and approval,” he says. Nyaribo took office in December following the death of Governor John Nyagarama. He promptly dissolved Nyagarama's executive committee. On January 6, he forwarded the names of seven new members of the committee and the three he retained to the speaker of the county assembly for vetting.The nominees include Emily Moraa (Finance), Peris Mong'are (Agriculture), Samwel Maiko (Lands), Jones Omwenga (Roads) and Thomas Nyariki (Public Service Management). Others are Thomas Ondieki (Environment), Stephen Onwong'a (Trade), Grace Nyamongo (Gender), Harrison Momanyi (Education) and Gladys Momanyi (Health Services).Omao further says the clerk of the Nyamira county assembly has published a public participation schedule lapsing on January 20 and vetting slated for January 22. He claims that the notice is short, hence public participation before vetting will not be possible.“The law requires a notice to be issued or published inviting public participation before the vetting of any nominee by the relevant committee of the county assembly,” reads court orders.He further says the action of the county assembly in the entire process has locked out public views thus compromising the right of Nyamira residents to public participation.“Deliberately shutting out the views of the petitioner and thousands of Nyamira residents which ought to be considered during the process of vetting and approval is not only illegal but also an abuse of the rule of law,” Omao said.Omao argues that the governor failed to nominate or appoint representation from special groups despite some of them applying for the positions.He also claims that the move by Nyaribo to change the names of some individuals he had earlier nominated for vetting and approval signals malice and a lack of transparency. “The governor’s actions of moving or re-designing of aforesaid candidates from their respective interviewed positions to others breached the principles of competition, merit accountability equity and transparency,” Omao argues.Omao told the court that in the event that names are forwarded and proceeds to be vetted, the residents of Nyamira will be denied their fundamental right to good governance and democratic process."
420,"We'll not join you in impeaching Ruto, ODM tells ANC","The Orange Democratic Movement has ruled out joining Amani National Congress in impeaching Deputy President William Ruto.ANC has asked Ruto to resign or face impeachment for allegedly undermining his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta.On Thursday, ODM said it was certain that the Deputy President would not resign but maintained that it would not be part of the process to impeach him.“We are not interested in sideshows. Our focus is to drum support for the Building Bridges Initiative. Let them embark on that process on their own,” ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna said.He, however, said the best thing one would do if they are in disagreement with their boss is to resign.“If you have any moral ground, when you differ with the political party on which you were elected, the thing to do is to resign. But there’s no principle when it comes to William Ruto, so we don’t expect him to resign,” he added.Jubilee Party has said it has not had any discussions regarding the calls by ANC.On Tuesday, ANC deputy party leader Ayub Savula said the DP's recent attack on  Uhuru over remarks in Vihiga on Saturday warranted calls for his resignation.Speaking in Sabatia constituency, Vihiga county during the burial of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi’s mother Hannah Atsianzale on Saturday, Uhuru said the Kikuyu and Kalenjin communities should allow others to produce a president.The two communities have produced the country’s four presidents since IndependenceRuto reacted angrily, saying he supported Uhuru thrice knowing very well that he was a Kikuyu and the son of a former President.Savula said the President only meant that Kenya has leaders from other communities who can lead the country when he addressed mourners in Vihiga last weekend.Three parties under the banner Kongamano La Mageuzi have weighed in on the matter and asked Uhuru to apologise for his remarks, saying they were against the spirit of inclusivity.United Green Movement, Ukweli Party and Communist Party of Kenya said no one should appear to be locked out of the 2022 presidential race because of their ethnic background.UGM co-party leader Agostino Neto said Kenyans who merit to vie for the top seat should not be blocked because they are Kikuyu or Kalenjin.Neto said the remarks undermine the right to seek elective positions as guaranteed by the Constitution.“Uhuru should be sorry for his remarks. He may have been emotional because he was in a funeral but we ask him to retract his statement,” he stated.He added that Uhuru should be the last person to suggest that Kalenjins and Kikuyus seeking the presidency should pave way for people from other tribes.“Why is the President saying it now? He should have said it when he was seeking the presidency in 2013,” Neto added.Lang’ata MP Nixon Korir, an ally of the deputy president, said the threats by ANC to impeach Ruto were far-fetched.“ANC just got excited with the remarks the Head of State made in Vihiga at the weekend. Where will they get the numbers to impeach the Deputy President?” he asked.Savula, however, said he is able to marshal the numbers needed to impeach the Deputy President.An impeachment motion would be successful if it is supported by at least two-thirds of all the members of the National Assembly."
421,Student to be charged with attempted felony for having a knife in class,"A 17-year-old student from Kwale was on Thursday arrested for being in possession of a knife while in class.According to a statement by the DCI,  the school’s headteacher Salah Yare had earlier reported that some pupils had sneaked knives into their classroom.""Luckily, nobody was injured since detectives and our police counterparts moved in swiftly and conducted a thorough search leading to the discovery of the knife,"" the DCI said via Twitter.""The teenager has since been placed in custody, in strict conformity to the law and will be presented before court for preparation to commit a felony, contrary to section 308 (1) of the penal code.""This comes barely two days after a form three student from Kisii stabbed two teachers to escape punishment.One of the teachers, Edwin Mokaya, sustained deep injuries in the forehead after the student is said to have attacked him after refused to be punished for reporting late to class.The second teacher Elvis Maoto incurred injuries in the wrist when he tried to prevent the student from attacking Mokaya.The student on Tuesday denied the charges of attempting to kill before Senior Resident Magistrate Onchoro when he was charged at the Kisii Law Courts.SRM Onchoro released him on bond of Sh100, 000 or a cash bail of Sh50, 000 with surety of similar amount or be remanded at Manga Children’s Remand Home in Nyamira County as he was a student."
422,Letter revoking Kananu's nomination forged — Nairobi assembly,"The letter revoking the nomination of Anne Kananu for the position of deputy governor was forged, the Nairobi county assembly has said. The assembly and Acting Nairobi Governor Benson Mutura told Justice Anthony Mrima that the document authored by impeached Governor Mike Sonko should not be relied upon by the court.The two were responding to applications filed by activist Okiya Omtatah and governor hopeful Habil Kongo challenging Kananu’s vetting on Friday.Mutura through lawyer Duncan Okatch said he has filed a complaint at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations over the fraudulent letter.The court heard that the alleged revocation letter could not be found in the register of received documents at the county assembly. “That letter as much as we want to sugarcoat it is fraudulent as far as my client is concerned. This is a document that the petitioners are asking the court to rely on to stop the vetting process. We urge the court not to grant such orders,” he said.The assembly's lawyers said the letter was issued on December  7 when members had already gone for recess. Okatch further told the court that pursuant to Kananu’s nomination, the assembly and the speaker had already kick-started the process to vet her. The process is not reversible once it lands in the county assembly, he said. Kananu, represented by senior counsel Paul Muite, also opposed the orders sought. She said the petitioners had ample time to come to court but chose the last minute to do so.“The gazette notice regarding my appointment was issued in February last year. The long delay is inexcusable and no attempt by the petitioners has been made to explain why they waited until the eleventh hour to file orders stopping the vetting,” she said.In the case, Omtatah has asked the court to stop the vetting and approval of Kananu, which would make her become governor. He said under the Constitution, Kananu cannot be deputy governor and definitely not the governor, since she never assumed office when Nairobi had a county chief. “The Constitution contemplates a holder of the office of a Deputy Governor, who is in office when the vacancy occurs, and not any other person, to assume office where a Governor ceases to hold office. Kananu was not, and is not, the holder of the office of a Deputy Governor,” he said.Omtatah said an election for both the offices of the governor and of deputy governor must be held unless the impeachment of Sonko is reversed by a court. He has asked the court to declare that Kananu is ineligible to be vetted, appointed, or sworn into office as the Deputy Governor of Nairobi City County and, subsequently, as the governor.The activist wants the IEBC compelled to announce a vacancy in the office of the deputy governor of Nairobi and prepare at the scheduled by-election for the election of both officers."
423,"Kang'ata: Emissaries have been sent, but I won't recant BBI letter","Senator Irungu Kang'ata has maintained that he will not recant his letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta inwhich he outlined a list of reasons why he felt BBI is unpopular in Central Kenya.Kang'ata said emissaries have been sent to try and convince him to either resign or recant his statements.""I have told them in clear terms that I will not recant that letter. Reason being it was factual. I was only reporting information that I gathered in Murang'a county which appears to reflect also the general sentiments in our region,"" Kang'ata said in an interview with the Nation on Thursday.Kang'ata wrote a controversial letter to Uhuru indicating that the BBI referendum was not popular in the Central region.He warned that as a result, the proposed BBI referendum faces a ""spectacular defeat"" in the region.The letter which triggered political suspicion, also rocked a major split in his Mt Kenya backyard.Though Kang'ata apologised, saying the letter was leaked to the media, Uhuru's allies have claimed Deputy President William Ruto is the hand behind the political turmoil—including the letter.On Monday Kang'ata was disowned by powerful Mt Kenya leaders, including the region's 10 governors.However, he still maintains that the letter was courteous and he did not insult anyone.When asked whether he will resign, Kang'ata said he will not resign due to pressure but if he finds a probable reason.""I'm a leader who does not believe in clinging strongly onto power. I do not want a position where he is embarrassed by the people from his backyard,"" he said.""I will not resign pursuant to pressure. But I can tell you if I get a good reason which will then justify my resignation I will definitely resign."""

425,IEBC denies sabotaging BBI through slow signature verification,"IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati has dismissed claims that the commission is maliciously slowing down the progress of the BBI signature verification process.In a statement on Thursday, Chebukati said the accusations of sabotage are unfortunate and untrue.He was responding to Suna East Mp Junet Mohamed, who early on Thursday had accused IEBC of intentionally delaying the signature verification process.Junet, who is the BBI secretariat co-chairman said there was no internet connectivity in Bomas of Kenya on Monday and Tuesday which hampers the progress of the process.Defending the commission, Chebukati acknowledged that there were some internet hitches which were swiftly addressed by the Bomas management.""The commission leased with Bomas of Kenya for the purposes of verification exercise. In accordance with the contractual obligations, the facility is expected to provide uninterrupted power supply and internet connectivity to enable data capture and verification process,"" Chebukati said.""The commission acknowledges having experienced intermittent internet connectivity challenges on the material dates at the facility occasioned by system upgrade of the bandwidth and power outages. However, the issue was formally brought to the attention of Bomas of Kenya management for quick action and the same addressed."" The secretariat had decried the slow pace of verification of the 4.2 million signatures the Bridges campaigners presented to the IEBC last month. Junet said they were disturbed by the turn of events.The lawmaker cautioned the IEBC not to subject them to another round of protests in a push to remove the commissioners.IEBC, in its January 8 update on the verification, said they had captured 544,624 records – being above 50 per cent of the required one million signatures."

428,Two more White Rhino embryos produced in December,"The efforts to prevent the extinction of the Northern White Rhino through advanced assisted reproduction technologies is still bearing fruits.The international consortium of scientists and conservationists that is working towards preventing it announced that two new embryos were produced last month.On December 13 last year, the team of Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Leibniz-IZW), Safari Park Dvůr Králové, Kenya Wildlife Service and Ol Pejeta Conservancy successfully performed an oocyte collection in Kenya.After immediate transportation of the recovered oocytes across continents, the embryos were created at Avantea laboratory in Cremona (Italy) following maturation and fertilisation of the oocytes with the semen of Suni.They were cryopreserved on Christmas eve when they reached the blastocyst stage suitable for freezing and increase the total number of viable embryos produced so far to five.This nourishes the hope that despite challenges and delays caused by Covid-19 the northern white rhino can still be saved.Females Najin and Fatu at Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya, are the only remaining northern white rhinos in the world.To prevent the extinction of the northern white rhino, an international consortium of scientists and conservationists harvest immature egg cells (oocytes) from the two females.They artificially inseminate these using frozen sperm from deceased males in order to create viable northern white rhino embryos.In the near future, the embryos will be transferred into southern white rhino surrogate mothers to create northern white rhino offspring.The embryos are now stored in liquid nitrogen along with the three embryos from previous procedures.Unfortunately, no oocytes were retrieved from Najin, who is Fatu’s mother. Previously, collecting oocytes from Najin was successful, but no embryos were created from her egg cells.More:"
429,"BBI will not cure the culture of impunity, ethnic division - ICJ Kenya","The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) Kenyan Chapter has expressed its dissatisfaction with the recommendations contained in the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).ICJ Kenya section chair Kelvin Mogeni said the commission does not support the push for the constitutional amendment, the recommendations, and proposals contained in the BBI Report and the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.“We posit that the BBI report does not lay out clearly defined arguments for substantive constitutional questions as response measures to the challenges raised therein… the proposed constitutional amendments will not be the magic bullets to the current social, economic, and legal concerns that affect the Kenyan people,” Mogeni said.In a statement on Thursday, Mogeni said that the decision has been reached after interrogating the contents of the BBI report and the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.“As a Commission of Jurists, our considered view is that the proposed amendments take away the gains contained in the Constitution 2010 and undermine the rule of law,” Mogeni said.He added that “from our analysis and monitoring of the public discourse, we conclude that the BBI process has been characterised by general mistrust, divergent political and contested interests, a failed attempt to inculcate a people-driven and people-centric approach which ought to align with principles of the rule of law, democracy, and human rights.”The chairman added that there is no guarantee that the proposed constitutional amendments will either address the underlying social-political concerns, entrenched marginalization, or historical injustices.“ICJ Kenya concludes that the issue of concern is that the Constitution has neither been accorded adequate time to organically shape the legal, political, economic, and social landscape nor given impetus to reorient Kenya's political culture fulfilling positive state obligations and rights of the citizenry,” he said.According to ICJ Kenya, the current social, economic, and legal concerns raised in the report do not require substantive constitutional reform measures.It has further said that there are a number of lingering challenges, including the Covid- 19 pandemic which should be prioritised.“Whereas ICJ Kenya support calls for a unified Kenya, we reject the BBI proposals on constitutional amendments in totality and reiterate that the amendments are unnecessary…what the Constitution 2010 requires is meaningful and deliberate implementation.”"
430,Kenya's cyber attacks hit 35.2 million during Covid peak,"The Kenya Computer Incident Response Team – Coordination Centre (National KE-CIRT/CC) detected 35.2 million cyber threat events between July and September 2020, new data shows.According to data from the Communications Authority of Kenya, this represented a 152.9 per cent increase from the 13.9 million threat events detected in the previous quarter.The increase in cyber threat attacks detected was attributed to the move to working remotely and increased uptake of e-commerce in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.The data detected an increase in malware and web application attacks.This increased vulnerability of organizations and businesses to cybercriminals who targeted remote working systems and tools, and e-commerce sites for fraudulent gains.Out of the 35.2 million cyber threats, 31,842,635 were malware compared to 12,508,275 recorded between April to June 2020. This represents a 154.6 per cent increase.1,245,451 were DD0S/Botnet compared to only 267,931 recorded in the previous quarter - a 364.8 per cent.A DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack is a malicious attempt to make a server or a network resource unavailable to users. It is achieved by saturating a service, which results in its temporary suspension or interruption.Occasionally referred to as a “zombie army,” a botnet is a group of hijacked Internet-connected devices, each injected with malware used to control it from a remote location without the knowledge of the device’s rightful owner.Web application attacks increased by 86.6 per cent to 2,057,369 from 1,102,840 the previous quarter.System vulnerabilities however reduced by 5.1 per cent to 28,482 from 30,023 between April and June. During this period, there was also an increase in online abuse and online fraud cases reported to the National KE-CIRT/CC.National KE-CIRT/CC also received 354 requests from investigative agencies.This was a 36.15 per cent increase in requests received as compared to 260 in the previous period of April and June 2020.During this period, there was an increase in child online abuse, online abuse and online fraud.Of these requests, 1.7 per cent related to child online abuse, 36.2 per cent being attributed to online abuse and 27.4 per cent being linked to online fraud.According to global cybersecurity firm–Kaspersky, Kenya is among African countries facing a possible increase in cybercrime in 2021, amid economic uncertainty occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic.While the increase in these crimes will vary by country, African nations must prepare themselves for the inevitability of increases in malware that already topped 28 million by August last year, according to Kaspersky research.“Thanks to the increased connectedness of people, the rise in unemployment will not only see a spike in traditional crime, but this will also extend to the digital environment – something we are already seeing,” Lehan van den Heever, Enterprise Cyber Security Advisor for Kaspersky in Africa, said earlier this week.Kaspersky security solutions in September reported 28 million malware attacks in 2020 and 102 million detections of potentially unwanted programs (pornware, adware among others), where South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria were the most affected.More:"
431,Gazette notice calling for Nairobi gubernatorial by-election suspended again,"The High Court has for the second time issued an order suspending a Gazette notice calling for the by-election of the Nairobi Gubernatorial seat.Justice Anthony Mrima on Thursday issued the order following an application filed by Anne Kananu.Two other cases filed by Okiya Omtatah and Habil Kongo respectively (an aspiring Nairobi Governor) are to be heard on Thursday afternoon.They are seeking orders blocking Kananu's vetting slated for Friday among other orders.Justice Mrima had earlier this month suspended the special Gazette notice issued by the IEBC last month calling for a by-election to replace impeached Governor Mike Sonko.The judge ruled the by-election suspended pending the hearing and determination of the application by Sonko, who argued that procedures were violated, hence, the impeachment is null and void.Sonko challenged his removal from office, claiming the due process was violated. He argued he will suffer snots ouster from office.Sonko argued that he will suffer irreparable damage because he stands to lose his position as the second governor of the city without due process of the law.Last week, an anti-corruption court formally withdrew a petition filed by a Nairobi voter - Peter Agoro -challenging the nomination of Kananu as Nairobi's Deputy Governor.Impeached Governor Mike Sonko represented by lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui had opposed the withdrawal of the case and subsequently filed a cross-petition.But Justice Hedwig Ongundi on Thursday said the alleged petition has not been paid for and it is not before her so she cannot make any directions.With the withdrawal of the petition, Kananu could be hastily vetted by the county assembly and sworn in as the deputy governor.She would then take over as the first woman governor of Nairobi.Kananu, a criminology graduate, served as Disaster Management chief officer in Sonko's administration."
432,"Long queues, delays mark start of Uganda voting","Polling stations have opened across Uganda for presidential and parliamentary elections, amid increasing tension and an internet shutdown.Journalists in Uganda have been posting pictures and videos of queues at polling stations in the capital, Kampala, and across the country.Polls opened at 07:00 local time and are scheduled to close at 16:00, although the election commission said all registered voters who will be in the queue by closing time will be allowed to cast their ballots.Opposition presidential candidate Bobi Wine is expected to cast his vote at a polling station on the outskirts of Kampala.President Yoweri Museveni will vote in his rural home in Western Uganda.Some diplomatic missions have cast doubt over the electoral process, citing the arrest of opposition members during a campaign marred by violence.They've also spoken against attacks on freedom of expression after the government told internet providers to cut off their services.Journalists are reporting delays in the delivery of voting materials in some polling stations in Uganda.Those who tweeted from various polling stations said materials were yet to be delivered by 07:00 local time when polls were supposed to open.The government has ordered a block on all social media.Here are some tweets from journalists on the Thursday delay:"
433,"Ruto, allies face punishment for moving to UDA - Tuju","Deputy President William Ruto and his allies are staring at a punishment by the Jubilee Party for joining and advancing the interests of the United Democratic Party.Secretary-general Raphael Tuju on Wednesday said they could face penalties as he downplayed threats by ANC MPs to impeach the DP for alleged insubordination.Speaking during a press conference at Jubilee Party headquarters in Pangani, Nairobi, Tuju said disciplinary issues are handled by the party disciplinary committee.The SG disclosed that he is waiting for the decision of the committee to be forwarded to the National Management Committee and the National Executive Council for a final decision.Tuju, however, said the party has never discussed Ruto’s impeachment despite a fresh push by MPs allied to ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi.“When it comes to statements from another party with respect to a member of Jubilee and so forth, it is not something that we have discussed,” Tuju said.ANC legislators led by Lugari MP Ayub Savula threatened to sponsor a motion to oust the Deputy President for disrespecting President Uhuru Kenyatta.Ruto and his allies have shifted to UDA, formerly known as Party of Development and Reforms, a Jubilee affiliate party, citing frustrations in the ruling party.The party also changed its symbol from a bull to a wheelbarrow and Kazi ni Kazi as its slogan.The wheelbarrow has been the face of the hustler nation empowerment programme headed by the DP that has attracted a lot of criticism from supporters of the BBI.Former Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama, a Ruto strategist, took over as the party chairman.At the press conference, Senate Deputy Majority Leader Fatuma Dullo, the only senator elected on PDR,  claimed the party was renamed without consultation.“We have seen the change of name in the media as elected members, not only myself but as MPs who were elected on PDR. There has not been consultation in as far as a change of name is concerned,” she said.Dullo, however, maintained that the party is still an affiliate of Jubilee Coalition and that the change of name has not affected the coalition arrangement.UDA has already fielded candidates in the upcoming parliamentary and senatorial by-elections, contradicting the Jubilee position to pull out of the polls.On Tuesday, Tuju announced that Jubilee will not be fielding candidates in the parliamentary by-election in Kabuchai and Matungu constituencies as well as senatorial seat poll in Machakos county.The SG cited the party’s need to avoid conflict with ANC, Ford Kenya, ODM and Wiper which he said are currently enjoying the good working relationship with Jubilee Party.“It is the decision of the Jubilee Party that given the bigger picture of bringing this country together through the BBI avenue, ceding ground to the NASA parties is essential to ensuring that we do not open unnecessary arenas for conflict with our very able partners in the BBI,” Tuju said.He, however, disclosed that Jubilee will field a candidate for Nairobi governor seat and three ward seats.“As for Nairobi seat for governor, we are on standby mode as the matter plays out in the High Court and the Nairobi county assembly,” he said.He unveiled and handed party certificates to Virginia Wamaitha for Hells Gate ward in Nakuru, Francis Njoroge for London ward in Nakuru and Lucy Ngendo for Huruma ward in Uasin Gishu.Tuju was flanked by Dullo, National Assembly Majority leader Amos Kimunya, his deputy Jimmy Angwenyi, National Assembly Majority Whip Emmanuel Wangwe, his deputy Maoka Maore and secretary to the Jubilee parliamentary group Adan Keynan. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
434,Governors: Why we can't pay nurses an extra coin,"""You won't get a cent more."" That's what governors have told striking health workers.The governors say they have accepted all demands by the striking workers except for higher allowances, which they reject outright.The governors, who spoke to the media in Nairobi yesterday, said financial demands can only be considered in a new Collective Bargaining Agreement.Nurses and clinical officers in 34 counties went on strike on December 7. They demand higher allowances, adequate personal protective equipment, comprehensive medical insurance cover and an end to salary delays.But the governors say they are some of the best paid civil servants in the counties and, perhaps, do not deserve any more pay. Any pay rise is untenable and will distort counties payroll.The lowest-paid nurse, at certificate-entry level, earns total Sh71,870 monthly salary and an extra Sh10,000 every year as uniform allowance. A certificate in nursing takes about two years and is open to people with C- (minus) and above.On the other hand, an entry-level clinical officer with a diploma earns a gross salary of Sh83,380 per month.Council of Governors' chair Wycliffe Oparanya said the current demand to raise monthly risk allowances for nurses from a minimum Sh3,000 to Sh19,000 is untenable.“An increase in any allowances has a budget implication to the counties,” he told journalists Wednesday.All health workers received salary increments of between Sh20,000 to Sh60,000 in 2017 when they successfully negotiated the current CBAs. At that time, doctors went on strike for 105 days and nurses for five months.“The total cost for allowances awarded in 2017 for all the healthcare workers totalled Sh5.3 billion annually,” Oparanya said.Health gets lion's share of budgetHe said all counties devote a minimum of 30 per cent of their budgets to health,  most of it on salaries.CoG head of human resources James Ongwae said the fat salaries of health workers had created disparities with other professionals earning considerably less money.For instance, entry-level engineers and economists with degrees earn a maximum of Sh65,750 a month.Comparatively, the highest-paid nurse in Kenya earns Sh428,430 while the top-earning economist or engineer bags Sh269,200.“We’ve increased allowances of these health cadres to a level now we have a serious problem,” Ongwae said.“Where is fairness. We have given nurses almost twice. We know about educational qualification of an engineer and nurses.”Unable to employ more medicsThe governors also said the high salaries meant counties are unable to employ more nurses because it is expensive.Last week, the nurses and the Ministry of Health signed a return-to-work formula, which was rejected by governors.Kenya National Union of Nurses' secretary-general Seth Panyako said the RTWF gives all nurses a 500 per cent increase in nursing allowance to Sh15,000.Panyako, who is campaigning to be re-elected at the helm of KNUN next month, urged governors to sign the agreement.“It is not right for the CoG to try to run away from the process they know and a process which they are not being asked to generate any income,” he added.On Wednesday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the ministry had already given its input to the RTWF and will not interfere with further discussions between CoG and the unions.""We have listened to the CoG at the moment they are engaged in discussions with the various unions but as far as the national govt is concerned it's clear,"" he said. He added: ""From a policy and philosophy point of view we continue to urge that the county governments continue and agree on various working protocols with healthcare workers. But as I say and repeat, we will not interfere. We cannot, by law, tell a county to hire or fire any of their workers, let alone healthcare workers.""Oparanya said any increase in allowances has to be authorised by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission and Treasury must commit to providing the cash.He said CoG cannot legally sign any return-to-work agreement on behalf of counties and so a full council would be required to ink a deal.Oparanya said the doctors' strike was resolved quickly on December 24, last year because there was no demand for extra allowances.He said all other civil servants including drivers are also at risk of contracting Covid-19.“Therefore, in the unlikely event that all workers demand a Covid allowance and increase in other allowances, the country will grind to a halt. We urge that health workers put the country first and adhere to the oath of allegiance to service,” he said.Last year, all health workers were paid Sh3 billion Covid-19 allowances for three months from April.  The allowances ranged between Sh5,000 and Sh20,000 for different cadres of health workers including doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians.Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis, who attended Wednesday’s meeting, said it was no longer possible to devote more money to three cadres – doctors, nurses and clinical officers – yet healthcare has 17 cadres.“In Baringo 55.7 per cent goes to health and we can’t stretch further,” he said.Rampant shortageThe Kenya Health Service Delivery Indicator Survey 2018 Report shows a rampant shortage of staff in public facilities.The survey, conducted by the World Bank and Kenyan government also noted rampant absenteeism of 60.7 per cent by doctors followed by nurses (54.5 per cent) and clinical officers (49.5 per cent).“During the unannounced visit, more than half of the clinical staff were absent. In fact, most of these absences were approved,” the report says.Currently, the strike has failed in 13 counties where all health staff are working. These are Bomet, Tharaka Nithi, Marsabit, Kirinyaga, Murang'a, Laikipia, Samburu, Narok, Siaya, Turkana, Mandera, Wajir, Nyeri and Machakos.The nurses strike is ongoing in 33 counties while clinical officers are only on strike in eight counties. Doctors from six counties — Migori, Nairobi, Nyamira, Mombasa, Garissa and West Pokot — are also on strike. Last week, medical lab technologists from five counties also announced they were on strike. These are Kakamega, Isiolo, Homa Bay, Baringo and Machakos.In Garissa and Mombasa public health services are virtually non-existent, with doctors, clinical officers and nurses being on strike.The governors also said they will not reinstate sacked health workers even through a return-to-work formula.They said several courts have also issued orders to suspend the strike, and as is, the strike is not protected in law.(edited by o. owino)"
435,Is Kang’ata on his way to Ruto's camp?,"Besieged Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata on Wednesday skipped a top Jubilee meeting, triggering talk of his looming defection to Deputy President William Ruto’s camp.The Star established that Kang’ata, who had been invited to attend the meeting at Jubilee House in Pangani, Nairobi, did not show up.When reached for a comment, the Senate Majority Whip said he did not attend the meeting because “I was busy elsewhere, I couldn’t make it.”The meeting was attended by Jubilee secretary general Raphael, Senate Deputy Majority leader Fatuma Dullo, National Assembly Majority leader Amos Kimunya and his deputy Jimmy Angwenyi.National Assembly Majority Whip Emmanuel Wangwe, his deputy Maoka Maore and secretary to the Jubilee parliamentary group Adan Keynan also attended the meeting in which the party decided to pull out of three upcoming by-elections.The no-show at the meeting – that culminated in a press conference – came a day after he reportedly rejected a push by the party honchos and President Uhuru  Kenyatta's allies to withdraw the letter to the President.Late last year, Kang’ata shocked the nation when he penned a letter to the President discrediting BBI’s popularity in Mt Kenya region, Uhuru’s political bastion. Uhuru's men termed the move 'disrespectful'.In the letter, the senator told the President that the BBI referendum might fail in the region unless Uhuru and his handshake partner ODM leader Raila Odinga change their strategy.He affirmed the position at a press conference in Parliament on Monday despite criticism and pressure to withdraw the letter and apologise to the head of state.“I think I still have an obligation to talk the truth… the truth is there is a systemic political problem that needs some intervention in our county of Murang’a and in the larger Mt Kenya,” Kang’ata said.He cited opposition to the expanded Executive, the involvement of provincial administrations and campaigns by former MPs as some of the issues working against the initiative.“Let us emphasise on the soft power and art of persuasion. In my humble view, the provincial administration in BBI process should be invisible,” he said.Sources intimated that Jubilee bigwigs hosted Kang’ata for a meeting on Tuesday evening, where he was asked to retract the letter, but he declined.“They asked him to attend today’s (yesterday’s) meeting and press conference, but his phone was off all morning,” the source disclosed.Yesterday, Tuju and Dullo confirmed Tuesday’s meeting.“We held a leadership meeting yesterday, he was with us…. He is still our whip until otherwise he decides or any other things come up,” Dullo said.But when asked whether he was ditching the President’s camp, Kang'ata replied, “I am fighting for the truth and rights. I don’t believe in Jubilee factions and divisions.”At the press conference, Tuju and Maore said the party had not discussed punishing Kang’ata for his letter to the President.“….it is not part of this discussion. It is not part [of the agenda] of any of our caucuses. It is not part of what we have discussed even outside here. Let’s leave that matter to Kang'ata to decide,” Maore said.Kang'ata has been one of President Uhuru’s foot soldiers and most trusted lieutenants in the Mt Kenya region.In May last year, Uhuru influenced his election as the Senate Majority Chief Whip following a meeting at State House where senators Susan Kihika (Nakuru) and Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) – key allies of the DP – were kicked out as Majority Chief Whip and Majority leader, respectively.Later, Kang'ata excited key party decisions by whipping party members to among others vote out Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki as Senate deputy speaker.However, his letter and skipping party meetings have triggered murmurs and talks that he was on his way out of the President’s circles.The letter emerged at the time his close friend nominated Isaac Mwaura joined Ruto's camp and tore into the President and his family at the homecoming of Msambweni MP Feisal Bader. The DP attended the meeting.Mwaura was Kang'ata’s best man during his colourful wedding held at Gathinja Catholic Church in Kiharu constituency, Murang’a county, in September 2018. The President attended the wedding.The letter also came around the time Kandara MP Alice Wahome, a DP confidant who hails from the same county as Kang'ata, issued a statement, scathingly attacking the President for allegedly using the BBI to cling to power.She claimed that the President is seeking to change the 2010 Constitution to help him gain control of state power while outside through what she termed a façade of democracy.“For Kenya, to remain a truly democratic and rule of law state, our President must accept the reality that his term is coming to an end. He must ensure peaceful transfer of power in 2022 and go home,” Wahome said.Kang'ata’s other close ally, Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, also hailing from Murang’a, and who is close to the DP, has too been critical of the President and his handshake with Raila.Nyoro served as the chairman of the National Government Constituency Development Fund Board of Kiharu during Kang'ata’s tenure as the MP."
436,Raila in joint 2022 campaigns plan with Uhuru,"ODM leader Raila Odinga has hinted at a plan to mount a joint countrywide charm offensive with President Uhuru Kenyatta during the 2020 presidential run.He said they will be targeting the grassroots in what is seen as a strategy to turn the tables on Deputy President William Ruto. The handshake partners have started their quest by rallying ODM and Jubilee youth leaders to work together to campaign for the Building Bridges Initiative, starting with Nairobi.Raila, who yesterday met 800 young people from Nairobi, said the President was aware of the meeting and that he had given his blessings.“I spoke the other day with my brother Uhuru and agreed that we bring together the Nairobi youths,” he said.“We agreed that we should first speak with the Nairobi youth and bring together the Jubilee and ODM youths so that we can start the journey together.”They will move around constituencies, wards, villages, and households to map support for BBI.Raila said relying on public rallies to drive the BBI agenda might be misleading as it would be difficult to tell genuine supporters.“We must know our people right from the grassroots,” he said. “From Nairobi we will go to all parts of the country, Machakos, Mombasa, Lamu, Lodwar, Migori, Kinangop, Mandera, Moyale and even to Eldoret so that Kenyans can realise that it has dawned.”The Uhuru-Raila strategy could reverse Ruto's gains and counter the growing 'hustler nation'.The recently launched United Democratic Alliance party, associated with Ruto, is seen as part of a political scheme by the Tangatanga brigade to divorce Jubilee.The new strategy comes days after Uhuru came close to confirming that he would not support Ruto in 2022.The President said in Vihiga last Saturday that the presidency does not belong to two tribes – Kikuyu and Kalenjin.He said it was time other communities took over, a statement that has elicited heated reactions, especially from among Ruto’s allies who have been angling for the President's endorsement.“I can also say there are only two tribes that have occupied the top seat, perhaps it is time for another community to lead,” Kenyatta said.The President and DP Ruto came together in 2012 in an agreement the latter would take over after 2022, but that is no longer tenable.However, Uhuru appears to be fully aboard the BBI train, hence the call for ODM and Jubilee youths to work together going forward.The ODM leader took a swipe at Ruto, saying the DP should marshal the courage and oppose the BBI instead of poking holes in it from within.“This is someone who wants to say ‘NO’ but lacks the courage to do so,” the former PM said, urging his supporters not to be swayed.Raila dismissed calls for multiple-questions, saying it was like giving Kenyans an exam “yet 50 per cent of the people cannot write and read.”He said the BBI has three facets of recommendations which require administrative action, legislative action, and a change of Constitution.The thinking in the handshake camp is that the issues proposed in the BBI cannot wait for the 2022 General Election.Raila said their vision is to have a Kenya where citizens get healthcare services, whether they have money or not, where elderly persons get stipends and women are given space to nurture their ambitions.“We must know our people right from the grassroots. We will do better than follow crowds which don’t give the correct picture,” he said.He put a strong case for the expanded Executive, saying it should be more efficient and more accountable.BBI is seeking to introduce the post of Prime Minister and two deputies as well as the Leader of the Official Opposition.Leaders who accompanied Raila to the Ufungamano meeting said the time was ripe for his (ODM leader’s) presidency.Nominated MP Maina Kamanda, Suna East’s Junet Mohamed (also BBI secretariat chairman), and Embakasi East’s Babu Owino vouched for a Raila presidency.Junet said, “I heard Ruto complain that he supported Kenyatta not because he was Kikuyu. But where did they come up with the debt theory? There is no debt owed to anyone politically.”Owino said, “Ruto has been talking about the dynasty. He is the biggest dynasty alive.”Waweru said they had been worried about Nairobi but were now confident since the two parties were together.Kamanda said, “We are waiting for him [Ruto] to come out and oppose the BBI.”"
437,Masinde Muliro varsity shuts four satellite campuses,"Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology has closed down four satellite campuses and ordered students to report to the main campus in Kakamega.The move, made public through an internal memo from the office of the registrar academic affairs Thomas Sakwa, shows that the closure will affect Mumias, Kisumu, Kapsabet and Nairobi campuses.“Following the closure of the listed campuses by the university management board on December 31, 2020, the senate during its special meeting held today, 12th January 2021, resolved that the affected students report to the main campus immediately for placement,” the memo reads.The university has joined other universities that have closed some of their satellite campuses. They include Kisii University, which closed down its Nairobi campus, and Egerton university, which also closed its Nairobi campus.The move comes against the backdrop of university reforms that recommended downsizing of institutions to enable them to stay afloat.Although the reforms proposed by Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha are yet to be affected, some institutions have started internal reforms that include staff layoffs and closure of campuses.Satellite campuses gained prominence with the popularity of self-sponsored programmes.Institutions of higher learning have been riding on the rapid growth in self-sponsored adult and evening classes that is part of the rush to get university education.The rush prompted fierce competition among universities to open satellite institutions in major towns in a bid to attract more enrolment.The main target is the working class, most of whom attend evening and weekend classes.Income from non-traditional students has enabled some institutions with low enrolment numbers and poor funding to stay afloat.In 2017, the then Education CS Fred Matiang’i announced a freeze on opening new satellite campuses in the country.Matiang’i faulted the satellite institutions, citing poor quality of education. He said there was a need to regulate the opening of new campuses."
438,Court orders seizure of cars used by drug trafficking suspects,"The High Court has ordered the seizure of two vehicles belonging to businessmen arrested in May last year while allegedly trafficking narcotics worth Sh3 million.Justice Hedwig Ong’undi also directed Barak Boru, Mohammed Abdirahim, Mohamed Adan and Momanyi Dennis (respondents) to surrender the original logbooks of the vehicles.She also directed the Director General of the National Transport and Safety Authority to register a caveat against the records of the vehicles.The accused were on May 24 last year arrested by DCI officers while allegedly trafficking narcotic drugs using one of the vehicles in Isiolo county.During the arrest, a search was conducted and 21 bundles of plant substance suspected to be narcotic drugs were found concealed in the vehicle.Barak, Abdirahim and Adan have since been charged with trafficking cannabis sativa with a street value of Sh3 million.The court granted the order after the Assets and Recovery Agency argued that the assets having been procured using proceeds from illicit trade and used for commission of a crime, the assets are liable for confiscation by the state under the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act.“There’s danger that the respondents and Equity Bank (listed as an interested party) may transfer or dispose of the said asset as there are no court orders currently preserving the assets at issue.""Senior state counsel Irari Mercy Faith told court that they received information on ongoing criminal investigations by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations involving trafficking of narcotics and proceeds of crime.The agency conducted an investigation, identified and traced assets belonging to Boru, Abdirahim and Adan who had been charged in court with the offence of trafficking in narcotic drugs.According to court documents, one of the vehicles was in their possession and was seized whilst transporting drugs on May 24 last year on Merti-Isiolo-Gotu-Merti junction within Isiolo. It was registered in the name of momanyi and Equity Bank.The other vehicle was registered in the name of Bank Abdullahi Boru and First Community Bank."
439,Ministry setting rules on elections of tea board directors,"The Ministry of Agriculture is this week developing guidelines for the elections of directors of the Tea Board of Kenya and those of factories under the Kenya Tea Development Agency.The Agriculture and Food Authority said a team is meeting in Naivasha to formulate provisions for eligibility, voter requirement, election process and resolution of elections disputes.“Once the guidelines are out, the ministry will have a calendar for the elections that will take place in March. We will have a draft of the rules by next week,” AFA said.On January 7, Agriculture CS Peter Munya released tea elections regulations under the new Tea Act 2020 and called for public scrutiny and opinions before the March polls.Munya said the enactment of the Tea Act, 2020 was a culmination of a long-drawn process towards reforms to entrench good governance and efficiency in the tea value chain.“Further, the reforms are geared towards a sustainable and profitable tea sector, particularly for the primary stakeholders who are the farmers,” he said.The Tea Act, 2020 came into force on December 24 last year when the Tea Bill, 2018, was assented to by the President.Munya said following enactment, the Ministry has now embarked on the development of the regulations to operationalise the Tea Act. Under the regulations, the number of board of directors in the tea factories reduced to five from the initial seven. Consequently, some zones may be merged with others. “Every tea factory to ensure that all registered shareholders have the right to vote and the opportunity to participate in the elections,” Munya said. No more than two-thirds of the board members should be of the same gender. Their tenure shall be for a maximum period of two terms of three years each.(edited by o. owino)"
440,"Looting of public resources alarming, says Maraga","Former Chief Justice David Maraga has condemned corruption within the government and urged governors to take decisive action to end looting of public resources.“I would say embarrassing as it is, it is an acknowledged fact that the country loses one third of the national budget to corruption. The looting of public resources is alarming,” he said on Wednesday.Maraga said every Kenyan should be committed to fighting corruption.“To be fair, I should add that all of us Kenyans are to blame for this. Right from the village kiosks, all of us keep cutting corners to steal from each other,"" he said.""As a result, after paying salaries and defraying other aspects of recurrent expenditure, there is little left for development. What that boils down to is the stagnation of the growth of the national economy.""The former CJ was speaking during a luncheon organised for him by the Council of Governors.Maraga challenged the governors to ensure the formulation of policies on the proper and equitable utilisation of county resources.“As county leaders, you are, in my view, under obligation to have, as your top priority, the anti-corruption crusade. You are, in my view, under obligation to ensure the frugal utilisation of the resources placed in your hands.”The former CJ said all is not lost as some counties have had excellent record of progress whereas there are still reports of misuse of funds that are availed to counties.He urged the governors to put the interests of Kenyans first.“The funds that are availed for service provision are meant to improve the lives and livelihoods of those that you govern. As leaders, we have a direct responsibility to ensure that these resources are put to good use. I implore you to remain faithful to your oath of office and to always put the interests of the people you lead ahead,” Maraga said."
441,"UK, South Africa Covid variants yet to reach Kenya — experts","The two Covid-19 variants identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa are yet to be found in Kenya.But the Kenya Medical Research Institute said Wednesday that some of the Kenyan SARS-CoV-2 genomes have mutations whose significance is yet to be fully understood.A virus variant is detected by changes in the RNA (virus’ genetic material) sequence. RNA sequence changes may result in a change of the protein structure of the virus if they change the amino acid sequence.Kemri scanned the spike protein of the local SARS-CoV-2 genomes for amino acid changes including the N501Y mutation that is shared by both variants of concern.The scientists identified a single sequence containing an N501Y mutation from a 43-year-old asymptomatic individual from Lamu in August.According to the experts, the significance of this is uncertain, since subsequent sampling does not suggest that viruses with this mutation have expanded.“We observed 12 new lineages at low frequency but have not expanded locally to give rise to many cases. We are sequencing samples from October to present and going forward we propose surveillance of 50 samples each week from across the various testing laboratories and ports of entry to monitor for new variants and will report our findings on a monthly basis.”Kemri previously sequenced 294 genomes sampled from the coastal region and Nairobi and identified 10 circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Kenya between March and June last year.Additional sequencing of 205 genomes sampled from the coastal region between June and October 2020 identified 16 circulating lineages.“We plan to sequence approximately 400 samples between January and the end of February 2021 across multiple sites in Kenya and provide a monthly report,” Kemri said in a statement.“At KEMRI-Kilifi, we have continued to undertake SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing mostly from samples diagnosed in our laboratory as part of the national testing effort. These samples are received from all six coastal Kenya counties namely, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Mombasa, Kwale and Lamu.” Last month, Kenya shelved a plan to restrict all flights from the UK over reports of the mutant Covid-19 strain. The government instead issued stricter measures to passengers jetting in from the UK. Already, Kenyan scientists have increased surveillance of the coronavirus after the new mutations were reported.“We have very strict travel measures with the UK which the US and the Europeans did not have. We are carefully observing every passenger travelling from there,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said.The WHO had reported that the virus was mutating at a ‘much slower rate’ than seasonal influenza, but officials from the UK said the mutation of the virus was allowing it to spread more easily.The discovery of the new strain sowed new panic in a pandemic that has killed more than 1.7 million people worldwide. Initial reports indicate the new strain spreads faster but does not appear to be deadlier than the original virus.It is not clear whether the rapid spread was due to mutation or people’s laxity in protecting themselves. (edited by o. owino)"
442,Students dropping out of school throng Lake Naivasha to fish,"Scores of students unable to afford school fees have dropped out and turned to Lake Naivasha to fish and eke out a living. Not even the rising cases of hippo attacks and deaths from boat accidents have deterred the youths, most of whom are breadwinners for their families. The Karagita, Kamere, Kihoto and Tarambete informal settlements are producing the highest number of dropouts. David Kilo, chair of the Lake Naivasha Boat Operators, said they were witnessing an unusual number of students involved in illegal fishing.Kilo said that poverty and lack of school fees had pushed the children into the waters, adding that there was an urgent need to address the situation.“The minors are openly fishing along the shores of the lake and this exposes them to hippos which in the past have killed tens of people,” he said.Elimu Mashinani initiative's Jennifer Njeri said the loss of jobs due to Covid-19 pandemic had pushed the children into the lake.She said that the children were now the source of livelihoods for their families after their parents lost jobs.“The minors are scattered all around the shores of the lake and are using bait to get the fish further putting their lives in great danger,” she said.Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mutua Kisulu said that over 90 per cent of school-going children in the constituency had reported back to school.“We shall investigate these cases around the lake and the reason as to why the minors have failed to report back to school,” he said. Speaking earlier, Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya said scores of students had also joined the sand business in Mai Mahiu area.He said that the numbers rose at the height of the pandemic, which saw schools close down and several parents lose their jobs.“As a result of the crisis many of the youths were pushed into sand harvesting and loading so that they could sustain their families,” he said.Natembeya said many of the students who were making a quick buck had opted to continue working as sand loaders after schools reopened.  He termed the move illegal.  (edited by o. owino)"
443,Family allowed to bury former KAA employee who died last year,"The family of a former employee of Kenya Airports Authority who died in November 2020 at Kenyatta National Hospital has been allowed to go on with burial.Rose Achieng died on November 7. One Moses Asum claimed he was her widower. He, therefore, obtained injunctive orders stopping her burial.Achieng's family had scheduled her burial for November 6 at her home in Ugenya, Siaya, but were stopped following the orders.A court has now allowed the family to proceed with burial plans. Senior resident magistrate Margaret Murage said Achieng’s daughter, Benta Akoth, has a right to bury her mother in Ugenya.“An injunction be and is hereby issued restraining the plaintiff by himself, or his agents, from interfering with the burial of the deceased by the defendant,” the magistrate ruled.Achieng' died aged 58 years. She met Abednego Omondi in 1975 and they began a mutual and consequential love relationship that culminated in a marriage under Luo customary laws. They were blessed with one child—Akoth. Omondi died in 1978.But Asum claimed that in 1988, he met Achieng’s family and paid dowry of Sh7,000 at first and later added Sh45,000. He failed to prove his claims in court.“The deceased has a house at her Ugenya home being provisions for her late husband which she visited frequently, as late as early this year 2020, and planned seasonal crops,” court documents read.From around 2005, when Achieng was retrenched by Kenya Airports Authority, she was living in Tassia Embakasi on a property bought, developed and registered singly in her name.She fell sick and was admitted to KNH where she died on November 7. All responsibilities, including nursing and processing and payment of hospital bills were “single-handedly” done by Akoth.Asum’s first act upon her death was changing locks of the city house and denying Akoth access. He was living in the house with one of his three wives.“He is a man who seeks to harvest where he did not sow. Cognisant that he does not have any right in the law, Asum filed the case in the hope that he may turn that friendship into a Luo customary marriage, claim and bury the deceased and eventually take the deceased house as his own,"" the court papers say."
444,Court dismisses logistics firm's appeal in VAT case,"The High Court has dismissed an appeal by Mars Logistics Limited against a charge of Value Added Tax on transportation services among other claims.Mars Logistics Limited had contested Tax Appeal Tribunal’s decision that transportation of goods in transit attracts VAT at the rate of 16 per cent.The tribunal had also held that transportation services that end outside Kenya are not exported services and are thus taxable.Delivering his judgment on Friday, Justice John Mativo said there was no basis to fault the findings of the tribunal.“I find that this appeal fails. The upshot is that I dismiss this appeal with no orders as to costs,” Mativo said.According to the court, the First Schedule to the VAT Act, 2013, exempts VAT on services offered in relation to goods in transit.In its decision of February 27, 2018, the tribunal had ruled that Mars Logistics sole business offered transport services for transit goods that were taxable under the VAT Act, 2013.The tribunal thus dismissed an appeal by the company against the commissioner for domestic taxes on tax assessment for 2013 to 2015 demanding Sh105,693,847.In the amount, VAT was valued at Sh82,982,244 and income tax at Sh82,982,244.The tribunal had further held that the company was not entitled to claim exempt status for the sale of motorbikes because the bikes were not exempt.In the decision delivered last week, the High Court held that under the VAT Act, the determination of whether the services are exported is that the same must be for consumption outside Kenya.“Consumption is not determined by reference to the payer, location of the service payer or of the person who is requisitioning for the service, but the place where the services are consumed,” the court said.The court thus found out that the transport services were consumed in Kenya and had not been exported.In dismissing Mars Logistics Limited argument that regulations made pursuant to the repealed Act continued to apply until the 2017 Regulations came into force, the court held that ""subsidiary legislation cannot override the express provisions of statute.""“Under the VAT Act, 2013, transportation of goods in transit is not zero-rated nor was it exempt from VAT,” Mativo said.The court upheld the findings of the tribunal that to qualify for zero-rated status, the service should be specifically provided in the law.It said services offered in relation to goods in transit were previously zero-rated but were not under the VAT Act.The court also dismissed Mars Logistics' contention that the provisions of the Finance Act, 2014, on exemption from VAT of supply of services in ISO 9001:2015 certified public respect of goods in transit as read together with the VAT Act created ambiguity.It held that the firm did not demonstrate important principles applicable to the construction of statutes, including the presumption against absurdity, the presumption against unworkable or impractical result, and the presumption against unusual or illogical results.On allowable deductions under the Income Tax Act, the court said one of the fundamental conditions that must be satisfied for an item of expenditure to be deductible, is that it must be incurred ‘wholly and exclusively’ for the purposes of the trade, profession or vocation.Mativo concluded that the burden of proof was on Mars Logistics to persuade the commissioner for domestic taxes that the expenses were incurred."
445,"Older teachers free to teach despite Covid risk, says PS Belio","Teachers above 58 years can stay at home but the ministry will not stop anyone who goes to school anyway, Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang has said. Belio said the government is aware of the greater Covid-19 risk for older teachers and advised those who report to school to be extra vigilant. “What is important is for them is to be careful; age should not be an issue so long as they adhere to the health measures,” Belio said in Mogogosiek, Konoin. The PS was touring the area to check the progress of the distribution of desks to schools. Belio said the government has put in place the measures to ensure the good health of teachers and students in all public schools. The PS said the government has delivered 60 per cent of desks to both primary and secondary schools across the country.The initiative is in line with the government’s plan of ensuring social distancing is maintained to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the learning institutions. Belio said that Sh700 million has been paid out to the contracted jua kali artisan suppliers across the country.“What we wanted is having our children in schools sit in a comfortable learning environment as we strive to ensure the health protocols are adhered to,” he said.  The ministry, he noted, budgeted Sh1.9 billion towards the process as part of the stimulus programme to ensure the local investors benefit. “All those who were awarded contracts and have supplied the desks have already been paid and that is an income to them and community because we know they have employed many young people to assist them,” Belio said.The PS said by Tuesday the country had attained more than 94 per cent attendance in secondary schools and 95 per cent in primary.  Belio was accompanied by county commissioner Susan Waweru, county education director Indiatsi Mabale and his TSC counterpart Charles Nyaumah among other education officers.He said the 6,000 teachers recently recruited have already reported to their respective schools. Another 12,000 interns engaged by the government are set to report soon. The PS also asked parents to support schools by remitting fees ""even if it means on instalments"".  (edited by o. owino)"
446,Country has enough maizeto last until June – report,"The country has enough maize to last until June, the January 2021 food security report from the Ministry of Agriculture shows.The report indicates that the bulk of the 2020 long rains maize harvesting is complete except for a few high altitude areas in Kisii, Mau Narok, Nakuru and Nyandarua.“Harvesting of 2020 short rains maize is going on in Nyanza and parts of Western but the bulk of the harvesting is expected from March this year.""Long rain bean crops performed well except in a few counties that experienced excess downpours. The short rain bean harvesting is complete in Nyanza and western regions, while harvesting is going on in parts of Narok, Bomet and Nyamira.Agriculture PS Hamadi Boga said on Wednesday the Food Balance Sheet projected to end of January 2021 shows maize surplus of about 21 million bags, 3.9 million bags of beans, 5.9 million bags of wheat and 238,790 bags of rice.The PS spoke to the Star during an interview on the current food security situation.  He said domestic food availability at household level was stable, which was attributed to harvests in short rains of 2020 and long rains harvest that started in June in a few counties. More counties are harvesting during this period.“Market and domestic supplies were also adequate as markets have been opened and are operational,” Boga said.He said most food crops in the high and medium rainfall areas of North and Central Rift regions, Western, Nyanza and parts of Central regions performed relatively well during the 2020 seasons.However, in Eastern, Coast and parts of Central, the performance of long rains was moderate. But during short rains, the food crops in these regions experience moisture stress, which affects the expected production.The PS said expected short rains production is between 35-60 per cent of the normal for most crops, and that despite the poor performance of short rains in some counties, food is available in the markets.The food security report further indicated that the dry spell in December 2020 affected most of the food crops, especially in the Coast, Eastern and parts of Central regions.“But in the first week of January 2021, several parts of the Coast, Eastern and Central regions that highly depend on short rains received some showers that have improved conditions of some food crops, especially maize, sorghum, millet and root crops,” the report read.Boga said the impact of the January showers is being monitored by field extension officers and will become clearer towards the third week of January 2021."
447,UN urges developed countries to provide Sh10tn climate funds,"The United Nations has urged developed countries to fulfil their annual pledge of Sh10.1 trillion to support mitigation and adaptation to climate change in developing nations.“We need to see adequate international support so that African economies and other developing countries’ economies can transition to a clean, sustainable energy pathway,” UN Secretary General António Guterres said on Monday.He said that to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, there is an urgent need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.Guterres said all nations need to be able to provide clean and renewable energy that prevents the dangerous heating of the planet.He asked for a strong commitment from all governments to end fossil fuel subsidies, put a price on carbon, shift taxation from people to pollution, and end the construction of coal-fired power plants.This could complicate Kenya's bid to put up two coal power plants in Lamu and Mui basin.Guterres said all public and private financing should support the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with training, reskilling and providing new opportunities that are just and inclusive.Kenya ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016. On December 24, 2020, Kenya submitted the national determined contributions detailing how the country intends to curb emissions.Environment PS Chris Kiptoo said Kenya’s greenhouse gas emissions represent less than one per cent of total global emissions.The country's economy is however heavily dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, tourism, wildlife, and health."
448,"Man suspected of killing wife, faking suicide arrested in Embu","DCI detectives based in Embu are investigating a suspected murder case where a man is believed to have killed his 34-year-old wife on Tuesday, before faking suicide at a nearby mango tree.According to a statement by the Directorate on Wednesday, the body which was loosely tied and inclined to the tree at a sitting position was found about 500 metres from the deceased's house.The suspect has been identified as Martin Mugendi.""Preliminary investigation by DCI detectives established that the deceased had had supper with her husband (the suspect) around 9pm last night, moments before he turned against her with blows and kicks,"" the DCI said.Acting as if everything was normal, the suspect is said to have taken their young daughter to a neighbour's house on Wednesday morning before going to his usual place of work.According to the DCI, neighbours became suspicious when the deceased spotted anywhere within the neighborhood.It did not help that the husband was saying nothing about her whereabouts prompting neighbours to commence a search.The body was discovered and taken to a local morgue awaiting autopsy.Meanwhile, the suspect remains in custody with detectives probing into the suspected murder."
449,Why state won't relax virus containment measures just yet,"The government might not relax the Covid-19 containment measures soon, the Health Ministry has disclosed.During the daily Covid update at Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital on Wednesday, Kagwe said despite the positivity rate being relatively low in the past few weeks, the government is putting into consideration other factors such as the reopening of schools.“Under normal circumstances, and given the positivity rate we have been experiencing over the last one or two weeks, we would be thinking about declaration of a flattened curve,” Kagwe said.“However we cannot do so at the moment because we have not quite taken into consideration the impact of the holiday season as well as the effects of reopening of our schools so for now we will be retaining the containment measures that we have such as the curfew,” he added.The CS announced that 123 more people had tested positive for the virus from a sample size 4,948 tested in 24 hours. Representing a positivity rate of 2.4 per cent.This now brings the total number of positive cases in the country to 98,555, with the cumulative tests now standing at 1,102,595.The rate has been below three per cent in the last three days.“We will continue to urge people to keep washing their hands and sanitizing, keeping their distances and we emphasize the use of masks so that we can keep those figures where they are. You have observed in other parts of the world where the figures have come down, the positivity rate has dropped and then a sudden surge has taken those countries back to square A.”A student was among the new cases, with Kagwe saying the case may have originated from home as the father tested positive. His father is among those in isolation.He urged parents to keep their children at home if they suspect they are positive.Four more Kenyans succumbed to the virus, raising the fatalities to 1,720. On a positive note, 412 patients recovered from the virus, 378 from the home based care programme and 34 were discharged from the various health facilities countrywide, pushing the recoveries to 81,667.As at Wednesday, 675 patients were admitted in various health facilities, while 1,945 were under the home based care and isolation. Similarly, there were 26 patients under ICU, 17 of whom were on ventilator support and eight on supplemental oxygen while one was under observation.Another 14 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen out of whom 111 were in the general wards and three in the high dependency unit."
450,Lawyer files petition to remove Havi as LSK president,"A member of Law Society of Kenya, Gad Aguko is seeking the removal of Nelson Havi as the society's president.In a petition dated January 8, Aguko claimed Havi has acted unprofessionally in breach of the organization's charter.He has accused Havi of unethical behaviour in compliance with LSK's relevant laws and regulations as well as audit accounting principles.""You have not been disciplined in carrying out your role as the president contrary to Clause 6.4 of the Charter which states that the council shall be disciplined in carrying out its role, with the emphasis on strategic issues and policies,"" Aguko said in the petition.The petitioner has also accused Havi of illegally disclosing confidential deliberations of the council.Havi has been accused of issuing public statements that were not objective and truthful.Lawyer Aguko said the LSK president made belittling comments against a honorable judge, Justice Pauline Nyamweya over a ruling she made against his favor.Justice Nyamweya had on December 3 suspended the impugned Special AGM pending hearing of the case.Aguko had moved to court asking the court to stop the meeting recommended by Havi, saying it was not approved.He said the agenda includes a motion to ratify the removal of CEO Mercy Wambua, which he called illegal.

452,Ruto supporters taunt Raila with wheelbarrow,"ODM leader Raila Odinga went to enjoy some ugali and vegetables in Burma market on Wednesday when pockets of DP William Ruto supporters  taunt him with a wheelbarrow.Raila, in the company of Maina Kamanda and Junet Mohammed, also  bought some meat and then addressed a crowd outside when a handful of Ruto supporters who were far from where the ODM leader was, tried to shout Ruto’s name.Raila went on to address the crowd and spoke about the need to pass the BBI documents which he said was a result of the  handshake.“The handshake gave birth to BBI which has solutions to many problems that we face today,” he said.On Twitter, Raila said he made a stop at the market 'to say hello to the people'.Earlier, Raila met youths to drum up support for BBI.Taking to Twitter, he said, ""I had a dynamic and insightful engagement with youth hailing from Nairobi county who pledged their full and unwavering support for the BBI process. The referendum train continues to garner speed unabated. It's now all systems go!""Raila has kicked off aggressive countrywide public engagements in what appears to be a tactical move to counter Ruto’s wave ahead of 2022 election.Raila’s tours that started a month ago came almost one month after DP Ruto scaled down his public engagements due to what he termed a surge in Covid-19 infections. For instance, in a span of four weeks, the former Prime Minister visited seven counties, holding strategic meetings with local leadership as he drums up support for the Building Bridges Initiative. The engagements are also laced with 2022 politics."

We are not taking that name because of that any other name. What has guided the party is her own qualification as a leader who demonstrated high leadership capability,” Kalonzo said at Wiper headquarters in Karen.“She just happened to share the name with other people.”Muthama fellout with Kalonzo last year and joined Deputy President William Ruto’s camp and he is now the chairman of UDA, a political outfit believed will be DP’s vehicle to rund for President in 2022.Kavindu is not new to politics.In 2017, she unsuccessfully contested for Machakos Woman Representative on a Jubilee ticket.Meanwhile, Wiper party also issued a nomination certificate to Sebastian Muli who will be the party's candidate in Kitise Ward, Makueni."
455,"US will not observe Uganda elections, says Ambassador Brown","The United States will not observe Uganda elections on Thursday, Ambassador Natalie Brown has said.Through a statement on Wednesday, the US Ambassador to Uganda said the cancellation had been informed by the decision by the Electoral Commission of Uganda to deny more than 75 per cent of the US election observer accreditations requested.  “With only 15 accreditations approved, it is not possible for the United States to meaningfully observe the conduct of Uganda’s elections at polling sites across the country,” Brown said.She said that despite multiple requests, the Electoral Commission provided no explanation for its decision, “which it communicated mere days before the elections”. Brown noted that they had complied with all Electoral Commission accreditation requirements, as they had in previous elections in Uganda. “The purpose of a diplomatic observation of elections is to demonstrate our interest in a free, fair, peaceful, and inclusive electoral process,"" she said.""Diplomatic observers are not participants or advisors in the electoral process.  Rather, they informally observe the conduct of elections, following strict standards of impartiality, non-interference, and compliance with local laws.”She said that America supports a free, fair, peaceful, and inclusive electoral process.  For Uganda’s 2016 elections, the US Mission dispatched 88 diplomatic election observers.  She further said that they are concerned about reports that the Electoral Commission had denied accreditation requests from members of other diplomatic missions and large numbers of Ugandan observers.  “Numerous civil society organizations planned to observe the elections, but many have not heard back from the Electoral Commission on their accreditation applications."""" Among those civil society organizations which already had organizational accreditation, the vast majority of their individual observers have not yet – two days ahead of elections – received accreditation badges,” she said in the statement.Brown said with the absence of observers, particularly Ugandan observers who are answerable to their fellow citizens, Uganda’s elections will lack the accountability, transparency and confidence that observer missions provide."
456,US executes only woman on federal death row,"Lisa Montgomery - the only female inmate on federal death row in the US - has been executed for murder.She received a lethal injection at a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, after a last-minute stay of execution was lifted by the US Supreme Court.The case attracted attention because her lawyers argued she was mentally ill and suffered serious abuse as a child.The 52-year-old strangled a pregnant woman before cutting out and kidnapping her baby in Missouri in 2004.Her victim, 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett, bled to death.Montgomery is the first female federal inmate to be put to death by the US government in 67 years.According to witnesses, a woman standing next to Montgomery during the execution process, removed the inmate's face mask and asked her if she had any last words. Montgomery responded ""no"", and said nothing else.She was pronounced dead at 01:31 (06:31 GMT). Montgomery's lawyer, Kelley Henry, said that everyone who had participated in the execution ""should feel shame"".""The government stopped at nothing in its zeal to kill this damaged and delusional woman,"" she said in a statement. ""Lisa Montgomery's execution was far from justice.""The latest execution was postponed twice - first by Covid-19, then by a judge - until a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for it to take place in the early hours of Wednesday.In a dramatic move late on Monday, a judge in Indiana had halted the scheduled injection until a mental competency hearing could be held.Her lawyers argued that she had been born brain-damaged and was too mentally ill to be executed.As a child she was routinely sexually and physically abused by her father and trafficked by her mother, family members said. Her treatment was so violent that it amounted to torture, her lawyers say.Her defence team believe that at the time of her crime, Montgomery was psychotic and out of touch with reality. That opinion is supported by 41 current and former lawyers as well as human rights groups like the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.But her victim's family and friends say the murder committed by Montgomery was so horrific that she deserved to be put to death regardless of her mental health.She killed 23-year-old Stinnett in Skidmore, Missouri, after befriending the pregnant woman online over a shared love of dogs. After driving to Stinnett's house, Montgomery overpowered the pregnant woman, strangled her with a piece of rope, and cut the baby out of her womb.Police found Montgomery cradling a new-born girl she claimed to have given birth to the day before. After her story fell apart, she confessed to the killing.She was found guilty of the crime in 2007. The next day, she was sentenced to death."
457,"Kisii student who stabbed two teachers charged, released on Sh50,000 cash bail","A 17-year-old Kisii School student on Tuesday denied attempting to kill two teachers at the institution.The student denied the charges before Senior Resident Magistrate Onchoro when he was charged at the Kisii Law Courts.SRM Onchoro released him on bond of Sh100, 000 or a cash bail of Sh50, 000 with surety of similar amount or be remanded at Manga Children’s Remand Home in Nyamira County as he was a student.The student who was represented by advocate Ben Gichana was charged with attempting to kill Edward Mokaya and Elvis Maoto at the school’s staff room by stabbing them using a kitchen knife.The prosecution led by Hillary Kaino did not oppose the release of the student.“There is no compelling reason for us to oppose his release on bail,” Kaino told the court.  The student was dressed in his full school uniform - a green sweater, white shirt and grey trousers and looked calm throughout the brief court appearance.It is alleged he attacked Mokaya for punishing him for arriving to class late and Maoto for attempting to rescue his colleague who was under attack.Mokaya who sustained four deep cuts on the head is admitted at Ram Hospital in Kisii while Maoto was treated and discharged.The case will be mentioned on January 27 for a pre-trial."
458,Matiang'i installation as Kisii elder signals bid for 'higher office',"The installation of Interior CS Fred Matiang'i as the Abagusii community spokesperson has triggered speculation he could plunge into politics ahead of the 2022 General Election.The position would elevate Matiang'i to be the community's political torchbearer, 13 years after the Abagusii kingpin, Simon Nyachae, retired from active politics.This even as it emerged that an elaborate ceremony is being planned by elders in two months time to coronate the CS as an elder, making him the community's de facto kingpin.This is likely to plunge Matiang'i into the larger President Uhuru Kenyatta succession matrix ahead of next year's polls.Some analysts have said Matiang'i could be a formidable successor to President Kenyatta. He has the President's ears and serves as the chairman of the influential National Development Implementation and Communication Cabinet Committee.The Cabinet sub-committee is in charge of the implementation and monitoring of all development projects by the national government.The decision by the elders to anoint Matiang'i as the community's spokesman has already jolted a section of Abagusii leaders who have dismissed the coronation.Matiangi's critics have faulted his crowning on Sunday, saying it was done without properly consulting all elected leaders from the two counties of Nyamira and Kisii.However, the Abagusii Elders Council chairman Araka Matundura told the Star the process of finally installing Matiang'i both as an elder and spokesman is not yet complete.“This [Sunday's event] was just a consultative session where we engaged the CS and informed him of our intention to install him as elder. We plan to initiate him as one of our elders in two months' time,” Matundura said.Matundura dismissed claims that the coronation was a political inauguration, saying it was a symbol of authority to enable the CS to represent the community's interests at the national level.“We have politicians but we want an elder who speaks on behalf of the community,” Matundura said, justifying the significance of Matiang'i's coronation as an elder.The Sunday meeting was attended by governors James Ongwae(Kisii) and Amos Nyaribo of Nyamira, as well as senators Sam Ongeri (Kisii) and Okong'o Omogeni (Nyamira.)Kisii Woman Representative Janet Ong'era and her Nyamira counterpart Jerusha Momanyi also attended the event at Kisii Agricultural Training College.“When we shall have the major initiation ceremony then we shall invite all elected leaders from the region including MPs and MCAs and even professionals,” Matundura said.In July 2019, the elders elder laid their hands on the CS, a symbolic community blessing of leaders going for higher positions in what triggered speculations Matiang'i was planning a presidential run.But Dagorreti MP Simba Arati, who was installed as the community's spokesman three years ago, insisted he holds the voice of the Abagusii despite the CS's installation.“Truth be told, I was crowned in February 2018 as the Kisii community spokesman by elders from Nyamira and Kisii counties. I took up the mantle long time ago,” Arati told the Star.The Nairobi-based politician welcomed the planned ceremony to instal Matiang'i as the community's elder but dismissed what he termed as a shortcut to crowning him to be spokesman.“The crown can't be given to two people. Matiang'i can only become my deputy and the second in command. He should know that there is the first in command,” Arati said.The vocal MP said his installation had breathed some generational change into the community's political leadership, saying he plans a major announcement in Gusii Stadium after Covid-19.“If Matiang'i wants to run for President, as the Abagusii spokesman, I will push for his agenda. The community knows who is the spokesman and it is none other than myself,” Arati said.Ongeri said there is need to embrace unity and peace among leaders from the larger Gusii community to push for the region's interests at the national table.“The Cabinet Secretary has done his part in uniting the country. The community has to give him support in his undertakings.”"
459,Inside shady dealings in school uniform sales,"Schools are compelling parents to exclusively purchase uniforms from their dictated suppliers - typically at above-market prices.That requirement is improper, says the Competition Authority of Kenya that on Monday warned schools against the practice and told parents to complain to their website.Schools that have deals with outfitters require parents to only buy uniforms from their favoured outfitters for hundreds or thousands of learners.In the latest case, the Star has learnt a school (name withheld) has forced parents to acquire at least five masks that are branded with the school logo as a requirement for their learners to go back to class.""Each mask costs Sh100,"" one parent told the Star, ""so each parent had to part with Sh500 to meet the requirement of five masks.""The exploitation of parents through special requirements and mark-ups is a long-standing racket between school heads and outfitters.Sometimes school heads themselves are in the business of supplying uniforms.In some schools, learners have been compelled to buy new uniforms for learners when they are in Form 3, even if their old uniforms are in good condition.There is no option for the parents/guardians/students to buy the uniforms from their own preferred suppliers.The rule has been and still is: the school buys the uniforms from their selected suppliers on the students' behalf, doing them a 'favour' and making outfitting easier.A spot-check by the Star shows that in some schools, the average price of secondary school boy's trousers was Sh1,200 compared with Sh800 at randomly visited outfitters in Nairobi.For secondary school girls' skirts, the equivalent figures were Sh1,500 from the school's outfitter and Sh700 in the open market, selected at random by the Star.Many schools regard wearing uniforms as a cornerstone of good behaviour, egalitarianism and projecting a positive image to communities.However, some stakeholders argue schools could achieve a consistent 'look' without tying parents to a single supplier.Nicholas Maiyo, the Kenya Parents Association chairman, says this has been a longstanding problem in most schools in which parents have become cash cows for schools and outfitters.“Simple economics dictates that when an item is bought in bulk the price per unit should be discounted, but that is not what parents encounter when they're sent to these designated outlets,” Maiyo said.Instead, he said,  the exclusive outfitters are far more expensive compared to other options available.On Monday, the Competition Authority for a second time put on notice public and private schools that have been 'recommending' specific outlets for parents to buy school uniforms.In a notice to the public, the authority's director general said some schools specify in their admission letters, and school joining instructions where parents should purchase uniforms without any benefit to the consumers.The director general has cautioned school principals and administrators against the improper conduct, saying parents are free to buy uniforms from their preferred outlets.“Parents should be free to buy uniforms from their preferred shops/outlets as long as school uniform bought meets the colour, shade, thread count and design as prescribed by the respective schools,” CAK director general Francis W. Kariuki said.Members of the public affected by the conduct have been asked to contact the authority through [email protected]Section 7 of the authority’s Act, No12 of 2010 (The Act) enables the authority to enhance the welfare of Kenyans, promote and protect effective competition  and prevent misleading market conduct.Last year, leaders from Makueni and Machakos counties urged the Ministry of Education to bar school principals from forcing students to buy uniforms at the school to join Form 1.The leaders said the trend was undermining 100 per cent transition to secondary school.Uniforms from the schools were more expensive with some people benefitting from the difference between the school outfitter's price and the market price.(Edited by V.

460,"Free calls for Helb, birth certificate queries","The government has established a toll-free call centre for round-the-clock response to emergency and enquiries.ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru recently disclosed to Parliament that the national government contact centre is almost ready for use.The ministry, the CS said, has already installed and activated the pilot line, and a voice response line with 30 channels.The government has also secured office space for the call centre at Post Bank House as well as equipment for putting the contact centre into operation.Mucheru said professionals are working on the regulations and the standard operating procedures for the call centre.The national government contact centre is designed to use short code 1588 as a toll-free number.The short code has already been allocated by the Communications Authority of Kenya for interactive voice response, SMS, and USSD.All service providers – Safaricom, Airtel, Telkom, Equitel - will mask their telephone numbers to a pilot line – 0204800000.“Citizens will be able communicate with the government at no cost using the toll-free number once ongoing consultation with the service providers are completed,” Mucheru said.“Citizens will have access to information on government services through interactive voice response and SMS.”The contact centre , he said, would be a one-stop shop where citizens will have access to information on government services.The messages would be shared through interactive voice response, email, short message service and social media.Former Telkom services personnel will be redeployed as contact centre officers, a process which has begun.Ex-Telkom staff who had been designated by the Public Service Commission as of December 2018 would be considered for the job. About 500 Telkom workers were retrenched in December 2015.Mucheru said the call centre would provide a platform for response to public enquiries and data sharing among ministries, departments and agencies.Members of the public will communicate their complaints and have their queries answered by dedicated customer relations officers.Embakasi West MP George Theuri had petitioned Parliament to probe why state agencies were yet to instal dedicated emergency response lines, and why state agencies rely on mobile telephony companies to provide the emergency call service.He argued that whereas a few government departments run emergency toll-free numbers, the majority still relies on the telcos that charge taxpayers exorbitantly.“Millions of Kenya are unable to access information from various departments of government primarily because the typical contacts provided are mobile numbers or landlines for both regular and emergency enquiries,” Theuri said.He thus asked the government to secure toll-free numbers in all vital and non-vital state departments manned round-the-clock.Theuri further sought that the ICT ministry teaches members of the public how to use toll-free numbers for faster feedback and to facilitate emergency response.The ICT committee chaired by William Kipsang (Marakwet East MP) conceded that the existing government toll-free lines for emergency services are often inaccessible, ""and therefore, impairthe noble intention of establishing them.’“The committee recommends that the ministry of ICT fast-track and operationalise the national government contact centre within 90 days of adoption of this report,” Kisang said in the report tabled on December 22.Kenya has had a challenge with running its emergency hotlines, a situation which saw it work with Safaricom to coordinate Covid-19 emergency response.The 719 call centre is based at Safaricom, with the company saying it can be transitioned and housed in institutions like NHIF to help deal with medical emergencies.The telco in its website quotes Dr Wangari Ng’ang’a - Presidential Policy and Strategy Unit in the Executive Office of the Presidentn - saying the helpline could also provide first aid advice virtually and even help with hailing an ambulance.The government also launched a Covid-19 contact Centre for front line workers at the National Nurses Association of Kenya (NNAK) in June last year.(Edited by V.

461,Kikuyu elders yet to see Uhuru’s replacement in Mt Kenya,"The Kikuyu Council of Elders has said the leaders hoping to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta will have to earn the position as it will not come easily.The council, reacting to reports that some leaders are angling themselves to take over the mantle from Kenyatta, said they need to work hard.Speaking to the Star, secretary-general Peter Munga said those who want the position must step out and demonstrate to all that they are equal to the task.He said, at the moment, elders are yet to see a replacement for the President in his Mt Kenya backyard.“Those who want this position must work hard in popularising the BBI and help the President in implementing the Big Four Agenda,” Munga said.As Uhuru heads towards retirement in 2022, speculations are rife on who will succeed him as the Mt Kenya region kingpin.But the remarks by KCE seem to suggest that Uhuru is still the undisputed king of the region and is not about to renounce this position any time soon.Leaders from Mt Kenya are said to be piling pressure on Kenyatta to name his successor in a bid to tame his deputy William Ruto, who is keen on making inroads in the region.Among those who have reportedly urged the President to name an heir is former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth.Kenneth has increased his political activities in Central Kenya and other areas of the country. He has been touring Central, presiding as chief guest at various project launches.Munga said the President is at the moment focused on implementing his manifesto.“The President does not have to come out to name the kingpin. Just come out and show what you can do for the region,” he said.Several bigwigs have lined up to succeed Kenyatta as Mt Kenya’s political supremo with one setting up a presidential secretariat two years to the 2022 polls.Among them is Murang’a Governor Mwangi wa Iria who has quietly established a presidential campaign centre, complete with a secretariat at an upscale estate in Nairobi.Others are Governor Anne Waiguru, former Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri and Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, former Justice Minister and Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua and Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia.Mt Kenya has a population of about 7.9 million, according to the 2019 population census, which by far is the country’s largest, making the region the epicentre of 2022 politics. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
462,Ruto bid to have Matungu candidate backed by independents fails,"An attempt by United Democratic Alliance, a party linked to DP William Ruto, to reduce the Matungu by-election to a three-horse race has failed.Five of the independent aspirants yesterday said they were duped separately by the UDA leadership into attending a meeting in Nairobi where they were instead asked to quit the race and support the candidate the party had settled on.The seat fell vacant following the death of MP Justus Murunga. ANC has fielded Peter Nabulindo and ODM has former MP David Were.On January 7, independent hopefuls were invited to Nairobi to meet UDA officials Johnson Muthama and Boni Khalwale. Each had separately been promised the support of the new political outfit.Independents Anzelimo Kongoti, Murunga's widow Christabel Amunga, Atman Wangara, Seif Omoro and Paul Posho have now warned outsiders to keep off the by-election and leave voters to choose their MP come March 4.“I was called in Nairobi and thought we were going to discuss Matungu leadership. When I got there, I realised that all other independent candidates had been called in and they were telling us to support the candidate the party had issued with a certificate. None of us knew he was going to meet other candidates,” Posho said.Posho said they are not members of UDA. “We are the only people who represent the aspirations of the people of Matungu because those other parties have been handpicking their candidates without the involvement of the people here.""Posho said UDA officials told them at the meeting that an opinion poll had been carried out and it established that Alex Lanya was the most popular aspirant among them and they should drop their bids to back him on the UDA ticket.They said that before the meeting, each of them had been told that the survey had revealed that he or she was the most popular candidate, hence best placed to work with the DP. But Khalwale later announced on Twitter that they had agreed to back the UDA candidate.Kongoti maintained that he will be in the race to the ballot. “I have not quit the race and nobody can stop us from contesting. My worth is the people of Matungu and nothing else,” he said.Wangara urged leaders from outside Matungu to keep off the poll and stop imposing leadership on the people of Matungu. “If our parties regard democracy they should not fear but subject all interested candidates to a due nomination process,” he said.Munga said she was in the race to achieve her dream.Paul Achayo is running on MDG party ticket. Other independent candidates in the race are Paul Atwa, Bernard Wakoli and Odanga Pesa. Wakoli has also distanced himself from UDA."
463,Uhuru's grand plans imperiled by cash crisis,"President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy projects are in trouble after a grave cash crunch hit the government – barely 20 months to end of this tenure.The Star has established the government faces a cash-flow crisis forcing the Jubilee administration to drastically reduce funding for mega development and other projects to free up cash for salaries and other expenses.A new report by Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang'o on exchequer releases by the National Treasury reveals development projects have been hit hard as the financial crisis ravages the government.The report shows  the National Treasury has released only Sh140.57 billion to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) for development against an annual allocation of Sh387.92 billion as of Monday this week.This translates to about 36 per cent of the total allocation, with only five months to the end of the financial year.With the cash flow stumbling block, there is no guarantee the Treasury will be able to disburse the remaining amount– 64 per cent – by June 30 this year.Normally, the Treasury should have released as much as 50 per cent of the annual budget by the end of the first half of the financial year on December 31, 2020.However, the report indicates some of the President’s Big Four projects -  mostly domiciled in the giant Transport, Housing,  Infrastructure and Public Works Ministry headed by CS James Macharia - have received full funding.For instance, Transport Department has received Sh12.46 billion out of the Sh11.27 billion it was allocated, surpassing the annual allocation by 13 per cent.Housing has received Sh12.13 billion out of total budget of Sh14.94 billion.The Ministry of Health charged with overseeing the rollout of Universal Health Coverage – one of the President's Big Four projects – has only received Sh6.05 billion out of Sh43.59 billion since July last year.This translates to 14 per cent.The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Blue Economy, which mainly deals with food security, has only received Sh895.69 million out of Sh4.61 billion while department of Trade has received Sh361.21 million out of Sh1.09 billion budget for the year.The Departments  of Infrastructure, Public Works, Environment and Forestry and Industrialisation which are implementing the big projects have received 39 per cent (Sh21.31 billion out of Sh61.60 billion); 47 per cent (Sh474.73 billion out of Sh1.01 billion); 43 per cent (Sh1.64 billion out of Sh3.83 billion) and 32 per cent (Sh1.19 billion out of Sh3.75 billion) of their annual allocations, respectively.The Ministry of Education has received 44 per cent of its development allocation, while that of Water, Sanitation and Irrigation – that is implementing some of the big dam projects – has received only Sh9.58 billion out of Sh36.26 billion or 26 per cent of the annual budget.In a sharp contrast, the Treasury has released Sh485.02 billion or 45.4 per cent of Sh1.06 trillion allocated for recurrent payment of salaries and other expenses in the 2020-21 financial year.The situation is even worse in counties, exposing the level of the cash crisis in government when it is struggling to meet its debt obligations to avoid sanctions and other penalties.Currently, the country’s debt portfolio stands at Sh7.1 trillion with some of the loans falling due this year.On Monday, Kenya received a debt repayment relief from Paris Club Creditors to delay due loans worth Sh80 billion to the end of June. This after the government requested for suspension of the loans.Kenya has been listed among 23 countries at risk of debt distress following heavy lending from China and other international lenders.The devolved units have received only Sh126.05 billion, an equivalent of 34 per cent of Sh373.59 billion they were allocated for the fiscal year.“It is a serious concern to us because if the counties and even the MDAs do not have the money, then budget implementation is not going on the way it is expected,” Nyakang'o said.The revelations emerged just a day after the Council of Governors threatened legal actions and shutdown of services to compel the National Treasury to released their cash.CoG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said in a letter to Treasury CS Ukur Yatani that the devolved units have not received Sh94.7 billion, an amount meant to meet the counties’ expenses for four months.“Please note that if the disbursement is not made forthwith, the county governments will have no option other than seek legal redress while closing down to minimise further damage and suffering to employees,” Oparanya said in the letter.He reiterated that the delayed disbursement has hindered service delivery during the Covid-19 pandemic when the counties are the expected to be at the front line in health services.In addition, county government civil servants have not been paid salaries for three months unlike their national government counterparts who have been paid all their dues and statutory deductions made.Late last year, CS Yatani admitted that the government was facing cash flow problems owing to increased demands and lower collections by the Kenya Revenue Authority  due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The report indicates that Nairobi, Nakuru, Lamu, Baringo, Kakamega, Mombasa, Samburu, Uasin Gishu and Turkana have received the least amount – between 20 and 30 per cent - of their annual allocations.Nairobi City County, whose crucial functions were transferred to National government, has received only Sh3.59 billion or 21 per cent of its total allocation of Sh16.8 billion.Nakuru has received 22 per cent (Sh2.86 billion out of Sh12.97 billion); Lamu has got Sh845.27 million out of Sh3.27 billion or 26 per cent; Baringo has received 25 per cent of Sh5.73 billion and Kakamega has got Sh3.66 billion out of Sh12.11 billion.Mombasa has received 27 per cent of Sh9.48 billion; Samburu has received Sh1.38 billion out of Sh5.44 billion while Uasin Gishu and Turkana have each received 25 per cent of their annual allocations.Other counties facing a cash crisis as a result of late releases are West Pokot (25 per cent), Vihiga (32 per cent), Machakos (35 per cent), Kilifi (34 per cent) and Kiambu (36 per cent).Wajir, Nyandarua, Tharaka Nithi, Nyamira, Narok and Laikipia counties have received the highest amounts at 40 per cent each.(Edited by V.

464,Raila denounces regional parties as Ruto plots to split strongholds,"ODM leader Raila Odinga has denounced what is emerging as the proliferation of regional parties ahead of the 2022 General Election.This comes against the backdrop of a strong wave by Deputy President William Ruto to split Raila’s traditional strongholds through the formation of regional-based parties.The DP, a onetime crusader of strong political movements to bring the country together, appears to have changed tack and is aggressively spearheading the formation of regional parties in a calculated move to break Raila's stranglehold.Raila on Monday at his Karen home warned of ongoing regional alignments, saying Kenyans must remain one indivisible nation.The former Prime Minister cautioned that such a move would only serve to further divide Kenyans along ethnic lines.He insisted the country’s dream will not be realised when people retreat to their tribal cocoons.“Let us move away from negative ethnic politics. Let us not talk about tribal unity. For example, (some will say) let us first unite as Kikuyu's before we go and unite with Merus and Embus to become Gema, then come and unite with the rest of Kenyans,” Raila said.Ideology and progressive policies, Raila said, should define the politics of Kenya.“Let us begin to unite as Kenyans and let us be differentiated on the basis of ideology and policies. That is what is important. Ethnicity is not important. Nobody chose to be born a Mkamba or Mdorobo. That is a biological accident.”Raila’s sentiments are seen as a response to calls by a section of Coast ODM leaders to break away from the Orange party to form their own regional outfit.Coast has been traditionally under Raila’s lock and key but has in recent weeks shown signs of revolting from the Orange party.A section of leaders are openly window shopping for a political outfit to be unveiled soon.The charge to break away from the Raila-led party is being led by Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and Kilifi North MP Owen Baya.Baya, who has been the face of rebellion towards ODM at the Coast, on Tuesday told the Star that the push to have a homegrown party is unstoppable and no amount of persuasion would make them abandon the idea.“People feel excluded from the mainstream so we have a strong desire to represent ourselves at the highest table. Baba [as Raila is fondly referred to] and his ilk are the people driving us into regional parties,” Baya said on the phone.ODM deputy party leader and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho was also linked to the ODM exodus. However, his handlers on Tuesday dismissed the reports in the Daily Nation as rumours.Joho’s handler who spoke to the Star, clarified that the governor did not utter such words and that it ‘was all a creation of the media’.The Mombasa governor has been at the forefront excoriating the formation of a Coast-based political outfit.Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir maintained that the Coast region will not exit ODM but will demand that the party supports their presidential candidate in 2022.“It is not that we want to form our own party but we want the party to support our own presidential candidate. It is time the party proved that it is a national outfit and supports a minority tribe,” Abdulswamad said.Last week, Baya billed the 2022 contest as the final nail in the coffin of what he described as a “foreign party that has continually used the Coast as a pawn in a game of chess"".ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna dismissed the mushrooming of regional outfits.He said most parties offend provisions of the Constitution, which require parties to have a national presence.Sifuna, however, said the clamour to come up with parties was normal, especially when the country is nearing an election.“These noises are normal during election time, actually, they are tribal outfits. We should not even call them regional parties; they are tribal outfits pushing parochial agenda. The truth of the matter is that those noises have always been there but they have never changed anything,” Sifuna told the Star on the phone.“All those talking about regional or tribal parties are missing the point and even the registrar will not register those outfits because they are illegal. In fact, the Constitution expects and demands that you cannot have parties that are defined regionally or ethnically, you must have a party that has presence across the country and that is the political landscape we operate in.”But, according to Baya, their proposed party will be national but have a foundation in the Coast region.Garsen MP Ali Wario also expressed dislike for regional outfits, saying the country’s unity is threatened by mushrooming political parties.“These people trying to camouflage regional-based political parties have their own agenda and they are working for certain politicians who want to divide this country into regions so that they can capitalise on those political parties,” Wario said.“For instance, Aisha Jumwa [Malindi MP] talking of a political party called Kadu Asili, everybody knows whom she associates with. So the idea is not about political party.”The Wiper lawmaker said as Coastal people they will continue to push for their stake in a national party and not a regional outfit."
465,Why Thugge threw Rotich under the bus in dams scam,"The Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji believes former Treasury PS Kamau Thugge will help him nail his ex-boss Henry Rotich.Rotich, Thugge and Koech were among 20 people accused of involvement in the Arror and Kimwarer dams contract with other top officials and directors of Italian firm CMC di Ravenna.But Thugge, who served under Rotich, struck a deal with the state prosecutor in which he might take to the witness stand against his former boss in the Sh64 billion scandal.A lawyer familiar with the plea bargain told the Star that the decision to convert Thugge into a state witness will strengthen the case.""The DPP needed a high profile insider to testify. Having charged so many officials, there was no one to testify against those charged. So it makes logical sense to cut a deal with Thugge,"" the lawyer said.Haji has also negotiated a plea bargain with former Wildlife Principal Secretary Susan Koech to testify against Rotich.The state could, therefore, drop the charges facing Thugge and Koech in return as the prosecution moves to nail Rotich, who fell from the helm of the Treasury after he was charged.The plea negotiations between the DPP's office and the two ex-PSs could present a major breakthrough in the high-profile graft case that has dragged for the last 17 months.On Tuesday, assistant DPP Alexander Muteti informed chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti that the State was no longer interested in prosecuting Thugge and Koech as they will now be state witnesses.Muteti asked the court to withdraw the charges facing the two former principal secretaries.So far in the file relating to Rotich, the DPP has withdrawn charges against four accused persons.In November 2019, the DPP withdrew charges against Bernard Kibet and Livingstone Bumbe who had been charged with breach of trust. The two were senior officials at the National Treasury. The DPP had ordered the arrest of the senior government officials and other high-flying officers after investigations revealed that the dams contract was awarded for Sh17 billion more than was in the original contract.After the DPP ordered Rotich's prosecution, Deputy President William Ruto's allies accused the state of selective prosecution targeting the DP's associates for political reasons.On Tuesday, Ogoti allowed the DPP's application and directed that Thugge and Koech’s cash bail be reimbursed, making them free men off the Kimwarer and Arror scandal.This is a major blow to Rotich who just last December, went to the High Court seeking orders to quash his prosecution arguing that the charges were illegal as he was never the accounting officer.Rotich had said in his court documents, that the alleged procurement violations he was accused of could only be committed by the accounting officer or employees in the procuring entity.The Kerio Valley Development Authority was the procuring entity for the two dams that snowballed into a mega scandal that nearly brought down the Jubilee administration.“I am not the accounting officer or employee of the procuring entity (KVDA) or the parent ministry and furthermore, the ministry of environment in a letter dated March 2016 stated that the board of directors of KVDA approved the development of the two dams,” Rotich had argued in his court submissions.The former CS had further claimed that the National Treasury or himself had no role to play at all in procurement matters at KVDA, saying the DPP had even disclosed documents that demonstrate prior planning.Former KVDA boss David Kimosop and former Treasury officials Kennedy Nyachiro, Jackson Njau and Titus Muriithi were also charged.Rotich had submitted that the Cabinet directive dated 21 August 2009 for implementation of Arror Dam confirmed that the project had prior planning.The prosecution alleged that a concept paper involving seven dam projects among them Kimwarer and Arror multi-purpose dams were sent to Cabinet for approval was a rip-off plan.“The said projects were concocted purely for purpose of looting public funds but as they were not part of the National Water Master Plan could only be made possible with the cooperation and conspiracy of the accused persons working for a common unlawful purpose,” reads court documents.However, on Tuesday the former CS appeared to remain the only top state official set to take to the dock as the DPP seeks to push for a conviction of the big fish in his anti-grant fight. Rotich, Thugge and Koech were accused of conspiring to defraud the state concerning the construction of Kimwarer Dam by entering into an agreement disguising it as a government-to-government loan.The charges dropped against Thugge include one count of conspiracy to defraud, willful failure to comply with applicable laws relating to procurement, one count of engaging in a project without prior planning, 10 counts of abuse of office and one count of committing an offence of financial misconduct.Rotich, Thugge, PS Susan Koech and Kennedy Nyakundi (chief economist, head of Europe II division) were charged with another count of conspiring to defraud in relation to the construction the of Kimwarer Dam.The Italian government allegedly guaranteed the loan and the suspects allegedly committed the offence between December 17, 2014, and September 27, 2018.On a second count, they were accused of failing to follow procurement procedures and another count of irregular procurement of an insurance policy through single-sourcing.On her part, Koech had only three counts against her which were conspiracy to defraud, willful failure to comply with applicable law relating to procurement and engaging in a project without prior planning.On Tuesday, the DPP asked the court to allow them 30 days to be able to produce 18 Italians who were charged alongside Rotich but have never appeared in court.The Italians who are directors of the CMC Di Ravena Company that is at the centre of the scandal have never appeared in court to take a plea.Richard Mabele who is said to be the Kenyan director at CMC di Ravena filed a case at the High Court challenging his prosecution.But the prosecution wants Mabele and the Italians charged with the same offences that Rotich was arraigned for.In response to his application, the DPP told the court at the time that Mabele alongside Rotich, Thugge and Koech planned to steal over Sh80 billion through the Kimwarer dams project.According to court papers, the DPP claimed that the Sh80 billion that the accused intended to steal made nonsense of the Judiciary’s annual budget of Sh19.5 billion, DCI’s 7.5 billion and Parliament's 45.5 billion.Muteti, for the DPP, told Ogoti that they have contacted the Italian government in a bid to have the Italians brought to Kenya.""Italy was the most hit by Covid-19 we were not able to process the matter against the appearance of number 8 to 26, we have placed legal assistance with the government of Italy to help with the suspects, "" Muteti said.The case will be mentioned on February 15."
466,Stipend gives TB patients a lifeline after Covid woes,"She looked frail, tired and weary. She is only 30 years old, a mother of one, but she can easily be mistaken for a woman who has been around for so many years.I knew Millicent Anna during her days in primary school. She was a bubbly girl, a favourite of many teachers and boys around the school because of her beauty.After so many years of not seeing each other, as fate would have it, I met her last December. She did not immediately recognise me, maybe due to the face mask I had on, or that I had grown into a ‘big’ man.I had not anticipated to meet her in this condition. Anna is battling tuberculosis. We went to her single-roomed rented house in the sprawling slum of Maweni in Nyali constituency. Amref Health Africa and the Kenya Aids NGOs Consortium (Kanco), through support from the Global Fund, have been running a campaign to help TB patients and Community Health Workers by sending them a monthly stipend during this time of Covid-19.I met Anna through this programme alongside other journalists and a Kanco official.A trained salonist, Anna says at first she did not know she had contracted TB. Around March last year, when the country had just reported the first cases of Covid-19, Anna developed a persistent cough, which she believed would clear after some time.“I have gone through hell,” she begins her story. Her daughter, oblivious of what her mother has been going through, kept interrupting our interview. She kept moving from one place to another, trying to catch our attention.“I started with a small cough, went to several hospitals and chemists to try and get medications. It did not help, until I noticed some blood stains on my sputum,” she says.Most of the time she became fatigued and could not continue working.“One day, while working on my client, I became so weary and collapsed,” she says.She went home after taking a few tablets from a nearby chemist.Her husband, a boda boda rider, took her to a private clinic in the locality and soon she was feeling better and resumed her work.However, in June, as Covid-19 ravaged the country, the Mombasa government ordered the closure of all salons and barber shops. A national 7pm-5pm curfew was also in place.This meant her husband could not get enough money from his boda boda business because of curfew and most of his clients were working from home.Anna’s single source of livelihood, the salon, had also been closed. “It reached a time I could not raise Sh700 for medicine,” she says.To make matters worse, their landlord issued several eviction notices.HEALTH DETERIORATESOn August 20, Anna went to Kongowea Dispensary after she noticed the cough was still persistent and her daughter had also started coughing.“We were both tested and I was found to be TB positive. My daughter was, however, okay. We were placed on six months medication,” she says.On reaching home, she found that the landlord had already kicked them out.“I had received bad news about my health. At home, we had been kicked out. Where will I start from?” she wondered.A lady friend of hers took her to her cousin’s house, where they were given a room that acted as a store to stay there until December.“January is here, I do not know what will happen to us,” she says.Several kilometres south of Mombasa, we met Zuwa Nyawa, 36, from Viburungani in Kinango, Kwale county.Nyawa says he started coughing in November 2019, while working as a butcher in Ukunda town.“However, I did not go to hospital immediately. I thought it was a normal cough that would clear within some days,” he says.In January last year, he went to hospital and a sample of sputum was taken for testing and unfortunately, it came back positive for TB.He was found positive with the Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) TB and placed on 18-month medication.Health experts say MDR TB is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs.These drugs are used to treat all patients with the normal TB. The normal TB is treated for six months and the MDR TB is treated for 18 months.“I have been taking my TB drugs from February. It is now 10 months since I started using the TB drugs and I now feel much better,” Nyawa says.The father of two had to return to his rural home in Kinango after the MDR TB diagnosis because he could no longer work.In March, Covid-19 struck and things changed from bad to worse. He could no longer provide for his family and for this reason and fear of infection, his wife and children had to leave for their maternal rural home in Kinango.However, in May, when he was about to give up, his doctor informed him of donor support from Amref Health Africa and the Kenya Aids NGOs Consortium (Kanco).“I was asked to register my details and told that every month, I would be receiving Sh6,000 for upkeep during the period I was under medication,” he says. He also gets a daily supply of medication.“I had lost weight and could not walk for long distances. Therefore, I was asked to stay at home as I got my daily supply of medication delivered at my place.” Nyawa says when Covid-19 struck, he was hell-scared and confused because TB has almost similar symptoms with those of coronavirus (lingering cough, fever, fatigue).“I was afraid my neighbour would isolate me because of the daily coughing, confusing my condition with coronavirus,” he says.Nyawa cannot explain how he got TB, but he believes that working as a butcher in Ukunda could have exposed him to the highly infectious disease. However, according to the World Health Organisation, economically poor and vulnerable groups are at greater risk of infection with tuberculosis compared with the general population because of overcrowded and substandard living or working conditions.DOUBLE TROUBLEAt Kikoneni Dispensary, deep in the border town of Lunga Lunga in Kwale, we met Pius Mbuvi and his wife Alice Mwikali. They are both TB patients.Mbuvi sat pensively under a tree, perhaps trying to figure out how he can fend for his family during this time of increased cases of Covid-19.This is the second time in two years Mbuvi is sick with TB. He was first diagnosed with the infectious disease in late 2018, and he took the TB drugs for six months before he was declared TB-free.However, in October last year, he was back to the hospital with the same infection. He has now taken the drugs for two months.“I have a challenge in taking the drugs, they affect my diet. I lose appetite. Sometimes, I’m forced to skip the drugs so I can at least have a meal,” he says.However, doctors said the TB drugs do not affect patients’ appetite. Even though Mbuvi did not mention it, doctors at Kikoneni Dispensary said he is battling with alcoholism, the reason behind his poor feeding behaviour and lack of adherence to medication.Mwikali, who in 2018 was the one taking care of her sick husband, is now also a TB patient. However, she cannot explain why her TB is different from that of her husband.She has been diagnosed with the multidrug resistant (MDR) TB. Mwikali says she first had fever symptoms that led to vomiting and coughing around March 2020, just when the first case of Covid-19 was being reported in Kenya.She was jittery that she could have been infected with the novel coronavirus.“I came to hospital and I was confirmed to be TB positive,” she says. Contact tracing was done and her husband was to be tested. Even though Mbuvi had already suffered TB in 2018, he was confirmed to be positive again.Mwikali is enrolled in the stipends programme, while her husband’s application is pending. While she gets Sh6,000 a month, they are largely depending on well-wishers and their savings to survive during this period when Covid-19 has ravaged the nation.“We can no longer go to the farm,” Mbuvi says. “Our children are at home. We largely depend on our food reserve from the previous harvest and well-wishers.”TB CHAMPIONMargaret Dama, 52, a mother of four, is a TB champion in Kwale county. She is the one who has been visiting Nyawa, Mbuvi’s family and a host of other TB patients in Kwale region, encouraging them to adhere to medication and doctors’ advice.She has been a Community Health Volunteer since 2018 and is affiliated to Kinango Subcounty Hospital.“We go round the region, collecting sputum samples from suspected TB patients and taking them for testing,” she says.She is supposed to visit at least three hospitals and have four community engagements on TB every month, according to her job description as a TB champion.Due to the risk involved in handling samples from suspected TB patients and interacting with many people, Dama has to test for TB every six months.She gets Sh4,000 stipend from Amref and Kanco to facilitate her movement in Kinango.Dr Lawrence Tanui, who is in charge of TB and Leprosy in Kwale county, says every year they register at least 1,200 TB patients in the region. However, this number went down during the Covid-19 period.“This was largely because patients were afraid of coming to hospital because of Covid-19 and the stigma around it,” Tanui says.In June and July last year, Amref Health Africa and Kanco did a survey on impact of Covid-19 on the TB epidemic in 89 countries.Rahab Mwaniki, the campaign manager at Kanco, says 50 per cent of people interviewed said they had trouble accessing medical services during Covid-19 pandemic.“Most TB patients cited difficulty finding transport to access TB care, changes in TB services, and fear of contracting Covid-19 during a healthcare visit,” Mwaniki says.People with TB also reported experiencing increased stigma due to the similar symptoms of both respiratory diseases.While most people with TB were given additional medicines to continue treatment at home, they expressed a clear and urgent need for immediate non-medical support, including nutritional, economic and psychosocial support.Most people with TB surveyed in Kenya receive treatment in public hospitals (56 per cent), followed by public clinics (28 per cent), and private hospitals (13 per cent).Only 3 per cent obtain TB care in private clinics, and 0.6 per cent sought care in an NGO or charity clinic.Edited by T Jalio"
467,Two suspects deny Sh28m Health ministry tender fraud,"A businessman and a woman were on Tuesday charged with obtaining more than Sh28 million from a supplier through a fake Ministry of Health tender.George Aketch and Mercy Waihiga Wanjiku alias Linda Masaka allegedly obtained the cash from Ibrahim Aden by pretending they could secure him a tender to supply hospital equipment. They denied the charges. The two suspects appeared before Milimani senior resident magistrate Zainab Abdul and were charged afresh with fraud and forgery on a consolidated charge sheet.At the same time, the magistrate ordered Aketch to add Sh170,000 to his previous bail of Sh30,000 pending the hearing of the case on April 12.The charge sheet says with others not before the court, Aketch and Wanjiku obtained from Aden 1,000 pieces of non-contact infrared thermometers worth Sh5.7 million through a tender and a local purchase order both purported to be from the Ministry of Health.They allegedly committed the offence on May 8, last year at Digital Marketing Ltd, located at Dunhill building in Westlands in Nairobi.The suspects also obtained from Aden 1,640 boxes of hand gloves worth Sh7,415,000 through a fake May 2020 local purchase order. The duo is further accused of forging a letter of the Ministry of Health purporting it to be a genuine notification of award for a tender.  Wanjiku is separately charged with forging a stamp in the name of Principal Secretary, Ministry of Health. Further, she is charged with obtaining from Aden Sh1 million as inducement for her to accept a consignment of below-standard hand gloves. In May last year, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe admitted the existence of criminal elements at Afya House who collude with cartels to pilfer public resources. He said the architects of the scam were using contacts at the ministry to con businessmen of cash."
468,Is your Covid-19 data safe and confidential?,"Kenyans have been asked to give their opinions on draft guidelines on access to personal data involving the Covid-19 pandemic.Privacy concerns are central.The government has called for public participation through a notice published on Tuesday on draft guidelines.“The Office of Data Protection through the Covid-19 ICT Advisory Committee has developed the Guidance Note on Personal Data Protection on Covid-19 responses, and hereby invites all stakeholders to submit inputs and comments by downloading the Draft Guidelines,” the notice reads.The expectation is that after stakeholders' consultation the public and private sector will have policy guidelines on processing personal data of individuals for information on responses and research on the pandemicThe notice said this will include data requests by innovators and researchers to give effect to the right to privacy and protection of personal information.  “Members of the public and private organisations are invited to submit substantive comments with specific proposals for amendments to the Draft Strategy within 24 working days from the date of the advert,"" it said.The Data Protection Act, 2019 was assented to in November 2019 to provide for the regulation of processing of personal data, provide for the rights of data subjects and obligations of data controllers and processors.The note makes it Covid-specific. The Act established the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to oversee the implementation and be responsible for enforcement.It is also mandated to maintain a register of data controllers including at the request of a data subject, and verify whether the processing of data is done in accordance with this Act.“The office also carries out inspections of public and private entities with a view to evaluating the processing of personal data, promotes international cooperation in matters relating to data protection and ensures country's compliance on data protection obligations under international conventions and agreements,” the Act reads.The aim is to ensure there is no significant risk or adverse effect on the privacy of individuals.(Edited by V.

469,ARA wants city trader Akinyi's two cars forfeited,"Controversial city entrepreneur Joyce Akinyi could lose two of her cars to the government if a court grants a request by the Asset Recovery Agency.The agency told a judge the vehicles were acquired through monies that are proceeds of criminal activity.ARA began investigations into how the properties were acquired by Akinyi after she was charged in court with a drug trafficking offence.Akinyi had been arrested on July 13, 2019, at Deep West Resort in Nairobi and arraigned. The agency believes that the properties it was going after were accrued to her through the trafficking of narcotics.During her arrest, the officers conducted a search and found 1,050 grams of heroin in her house.The agency told the court that it had information that Akinyi acquired massive assets and properties using the proceeds from the trade of narcotic drugs.Investigations revealed that she used her account held at Stanbic Bank as a conduit for laundering proceeds of crime.“Unless this honourable court grants the orders sought, the economic advantage derived from the commission of crimes will continue to benefit a few to the disadvantage of national security, interest, economy and general interest,” the agency said.In an affidavit in support of the application, police officer Fredrick Muriuki says the investigations against Akinyi started in 2000 when she allegedly ventured into acquisition, sale and distribution of drugs together with her estranged husband, Nigerian national Anthony Chinedu.Together, the two registered a company called Deep West Resort in 2010 to disguise the proceeds of the drug trade.On March 31, 2015, Akinyi was arrested at Dam II estate in Langata with 31.6 grams of heroin with a market value of Sh94,800 and later on charged.She was again arrested in 2019. Eight drug mules were also arrested and charged. Of the eight, four are Kenyans while the other four are from Cameroon, Congo, Nigeria and Pakistan."
470,Blow to Sonko as court refuses to stop Kananu vetting,"Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has lost a bid to stop the county assembly from vetting and approving Anne Kananu Mwenda as deputy governor.Sonko had sought the orders on grounds that he had revoked Kananu’s nomination on December 7 last year.He told Justice Anthony Mrima that the intention by the assembly to appoint Kananu as the deputy governor would, therefore, be invalid.In court documents, Sonko also claimed President Uhuru Kenyatta's sister Kristina Pratt Kenyatta had tried to influence his choice prior to the impeachment. He said Kristina sought his favour in appointing Jane Weru to the position. But Kananu through lawyer Paul Muite told the court Sonko's revocation of her nomination is useless and had no legal effect. She said Sonko had no authority to withdraw the nomination once it had been tabled before the county assembly for vetting. A contrary decision would be a threat to the doctrine of separation of powers. The court declined to issue any conservatory orders and directed parties to highlight their submissions in the case on February 4. At the same time, the court allowed the Attorney General to participate in the proceedings as an interested party. Meanwhile, two other cases filed by Habil Kongo and Okiya Omtatah touching on similar issues were consolidated.  The judge directed the assembly and other parties to file their responses in the matter ahead of hearing tomorrow at 2pm. In the cases, Kongo says he is an aspiring candidate for the Nairobi governor's seat and is opposed to the vetting of Kananu.Kongo told the court that he wishes to bring on board his choice of deputy once he makes it to the ballot. He asked the court. “If Kananu is to be vetted, what becomes of my deputy governor of choice?” He said the public is entitled to a by-election. Kongo also said that even if the nomination of Kananu was valid, Sonko’s impeachment dealt it a blow. Omtatah on the other hand told the court that under the Constitution, Kananu cannot be deputy governor and definitely not the governor, since she never assumed office when Nairobi had a county chief. “The Constitution contemplates a holder of the office of a deputy governor, who is in office when the vacancy occurs, and not any other person, to assume office where a governor ceases to hold office. Kananu was not, and is not, the holder of the office of deputy governor,” he said.It is for that reason that Omtatah said an election for both the offices of the governor and of deputy governor must be held unless the impeachment of Sonko is reversed."
471,"Call to equip, provide personnel at Naivasha child protection unit","Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara on Tuesday raised concerns over the lack of personnel and equipment at Naivasha Child Protection Unit.The unit, which has been lying idle for years, is managed by one police officer. Kihara visited the police station on a fact-finding mission following concerns over the status of the facility.She urged the national government to equip the facility as it was critical in assisting minors. She said the NG-CDF could not assist in equipping the facility as this fell squarely under the national government.“This centre that was meant to come to the rescue of minors was completed a couple of years ago but unfortunately is has remained unutilised over lack of personnel and equipment,” Kihara said.Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru termed the Child Protection Unit as very crucial to the police station.He said they had been forced to use one wing of the unit to hold minors who had been arrested for various crimes.“We have rescued dozens of minors either dumped from the streets or from troubled families and we have been forced to take them to the privately run Safe House,” he said.MP Kihara also expressed her concern over the status of the busy police station, saying the officers deserve a better working environment. “These officers are doing a gallant job in terms of security and the only way we can reward them is by offering them a conducive environment to serve wananchi,” she said.During the visit, the MP donated a laptop to the police station for record-keeping."
472,"Rains to continue seven more days, says Met","Unseasonal rains in Central and Western Kenya will continue throughout this week, the Meteorological Department has predicted.The light rains might help crops that were planted late last year during the delayed short rains. It will, however, not be enough to recharge groundwater ahead of the long dry season ahead.Met director Stella Aura said the rains will spread over the Lake Victoria basin, Rift Valley highlands, Central Kenya, including Nairobi, and the southeastern lowlands towards Tanzania.The rains appear to be spreading to Kenya from northern Tanzania, according to an image provided by the Met department.“The Coastal Strip, northeastern and northwestern Kenya are likely to be generally dry,” Aura said.Parts of Turkana and Marsabit counties will experience strong winds at high speeds, she said.In a separate forecast for the entire month of January, Aura said the rains would end after the first two weeks.“A few areas in western Kenya, especially those around the Lake Victoria basin, southern Rift Valley, the southeastern lowlands (Kajiado, Kitui, Makueni, Machakos and Taita Taveta) and parts of central are, however, likely to experience occasional rainfall,” she said.Aura said La Niña conditions, which lead to dry weather in Kenya, are still present.January is a typically dry month suitable for harvesting, drying and storage of grains in agricultural areas. However, farmers have still not harvested their crops because they were planted late.The December rains were also depressed and most meteorological stations recorded below 75 per cent of the December-long term averages.Last week, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, supported by USAID, warned of a decline in food security across Kenya.Most affected will be people in eastern and northern Kenya, who will need relief food and livestock offtake by May.The outlook said pastoral areas will be most affected because the short rains were below average and there are three dry months ahead.The early warning platform advises farmers to sell some of their livestock through offtake programmes.“The forecast below-average 2021 long rains are expected to lead to short-lived pasture and water regeneration, and gradual declines in livestock body conditions and production, limiting household access to food and income,” the FewsNet prediction said.It said urban families will also suffer food shortages due to low incomes and higher-priced commodities impacting household purchasing power.Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey recently advised pastoralists in Northeastern to start selling their livestock to avoid losing them during the looming dry season.According to the Nairobi-based Igad Climate Prediction and Application Centre, there will be hot weather in most parts of the country between now and March."
473,Thirdway Alliance files petition to stop Kananu's vetting as DG,"Thirdway Alliance party is seeking to stop the vetting of Anne Kananu for the Nairobi County Deputy Governor position.In a petition dated January 11, the party said Kananu's vetting is a back door move to prevent city residents from voting in a leader of their choice.""...That the move to proceed with the vetting of the 2nd Respondent (Kananu) as the nominee as the Deputy governor is aimed at ensuring that the by-elections scheduled for February 18 do not take place so that the second Respondent is subsequently and through the backdoor sworn in to take up the role of the Governor of Nairobi County,"" the party said in the petition seen by the Star.According to the party, which has nominated lawyer Miguna Miguna as its preferred candidate for the gubernatorial race, such a move to stop a by-election is illegal and unconstitutional hence a blatant violation of the right to vote as stipulated in the Kenyan Constitution.""The Petition challenges the unconstitutionality of the impugned vetting process and subsequent swearing in of the 2nd Respondent as the deputy Governor/governor of Nairobi County,"" the party said.In its petition, the party has accused the Nairobi County Assembly of having  ulterior motives through allegedly intending to block a democratic process.Impeached Governor Mike Sonko had nominated Kananu as his deputy last year.According to Thirdway Alliance Kenya, the move was motivated by the complexity of the situation in Nairobi and was meant to ensure continuity after he was barred from office.Sonko who is also now seeking to stop Kananu's vetting has to wait until Thursday 2pm for the judge hearing.Justuce Anthony Mrima on Tuesday declined to issue the orders sought in Sonko's application and directed parties to highlight their submissions in the case on February 4."
474,MP Wahome summoned for saying state planned Kenol chaos,"The cohesion commission has summoned Kandara MP Alice Wahome to appear before it on Thursday on charges of hate speech.The lawmaker is being sought for saying the state planned the attack on AIPCA church last October.Two youths – Peter Mbothu and Christopher Kariuki – died in the chaos that greeted DP William Ruto’s tour of the area.MP Wahome, in the statement as transcribed by the NCIC, says ""the security (team) was part of the plan to attack the AIPCA church.”The National Cohesion and Integration Commission says the words the lawmaker made in Kenol area, Murang’a county, in October last year were hateful.In the transcript attached to her summonses, the MP is quoted lamenting that it took efforts of members of the public to repulse the attackers. She also says the lot was ferried in three buses and was paid Sh1,100 transport reimbursement.MP Wahome, the NCIC notice reads, also raised concerns that police officers – who were metres away from the scene of the incident – turned a deaf ear to locals.She is quoted as calling on Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to resign ""if he insists he was not aware of the attack"".The lawmaker is further in trouble for saying government operatives and officials at the Interior ministry had prior knowledge of the violence.The NCIC, in the summons, says MP Wahome's words were calculated as hateful. It holds that the utterances are likely to affect harmonious coexistence between communities living in the Mt Kenya region.“You (MP Wahome) are hereby required to appear at the commission’s offices…on Thursday, January 14, at 10 am so as to assist the commission with the ongoing investigations,” commission secretary Skitter Mbugua said.“Take further notice that unless you appear in person at the aforementioned place, date and time, the commission shall institute contempt proceedings against you with the attendant consequences.”The NCIC transcript shows the MP accusing President Uhuru Kenyatta of turning a blind eye to people planning to ethnically mobilise Mt Kenya people, ostensibly against DP Ruto.She also took a swipe at the President for letting taxpayer’s money be used to mobilise youths along ethnic lines.MP Wahome is also quoted accusing the police of keeping off the DP’s event yet they (the police) had credible intelligence there would be chaos.NCIC quotes her pointing fingers at Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, Interior PS Karanja Kibicho, Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai, and the DCI.This followed that the officials had not issued any statement citing who was behind the October 4, 2020, chaos.""You (it is unclear who is referred to) have hopelessly tried to drag my name and the name of Nyoro (Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro) into this organised crime.“You are now organising another crime by mobilising youths using cultural rights, using cultural connotations…and I want to tell you…I want to warn you that Kenya does not operate in isolation...Kenya operates in a global economy, a global world where intolerance where democracy must be allowed to thrive.”A police intelligence report showed that the violence was planned in advance and the youths were imported.The report showed that when another group got wind of the attack of the impending attack, they planned a counter attack hence the chaos.Wahome, in the transcribed utterances, said the money be used to “build hospitals, take water to the villages, or used within a hospital in Kenol or Thika.”MP Wahome also took a swipe at the GEMA Cultural Association, in the speech NCIC wants her charged, for facilitating the mobilisation.The lawmaker said she’d write to the Interior minister Fred Matiang’i and copy Interior PS Karanja Kibicho highlighting her concerns.“I will copy that letter to the Inspector General of Police who personally is likely going forward to take responsibility of some of this crimes like disrupting people’s meeting, like over citing murder, killings of the youths, like over citing mobilisation of police to disrupt meetings with a political agenda,” the NCIC notice reads.The commission quotes the MP as having stated she’d copy the letter to Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, the Kenya Human Rights Commission, American Embassy, IPOA – for independent investigations into the Maragua Kenol incident – and the European Union.The lawmaker was not immediately available for comment.ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna and Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa recently had a date with the NCIC over hate remarks made in the recent Msambweni MP by-election. They were later let off the hook after apologising."

477,Court dismisses application seeking to bar Mwilu from acting as Chief Justice,"Justice Antony Mrima has dismissed an application by rights activist Okiya Omtatah seeking to temporarily stop Mwilu from taking over as Chief Justice position in an acting capacity.Omtatah had asked the court to stop Mwilu from being taking over the CJ position arguing that she had several pending cases in court.The activist argued that she was unfit to hold public office.However, Justice Mrima on Tuesday ruled that none of the cases before JSC had been determined and it would be unfair to remove her.The ruling comes a day after the retirement of David Maraga who handed over the instruments of power to Mwilu on his last day in office.Mwilu praised her former boss saying Maraga is leaving a proud legacy, especially on judicial independence, protecting and entrenching the rule of law.She promised to carry on from where he left off.“For whatever period it will please for me to serve as CJ, we will build on your legacy.”Earlier this month, Mwilu told the court that corruption and abuse of office complaints before the Judicial Service Commission cannot stop her from acting as Chief Justice.Mwilu told Justice Anthony Mrima that a judge’s integrity does not diminish or end nor does she stop serving on account of pending complaints on her removal.Through her lawyers Nelson Havi and Julie Soweto she said her case cannot be any different. Mwilu told the court that the JSC does not appoint an acting Chief Justice. It cannot be prohibited from undertaking a function not given to it."

480,Former Treasury PS Thugge to testify against ex-CS Rotich in dams scandal case,"The Director of Public Prosecution has withdrawn charges against Treasury former PS Kamau Thugge who will now be a key prosecution witness in the Kimwarer and Arror Dams Scandal case.Thugge will now testify against his former boss Ex-CS Henry Rotich in the multi-billion corruption case that he is facing in court.Assistant DPP Alexander Muteti on Tuesday told Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti that they were withdrawing charges against Thugge.Thugge was charged alongside Rotich but he will now be a witness alongside former Wildlife PS Susan Koech whose charges have also been dropped.Ogoti allowed the application by the prosecution and directed that Thugge and Koech’s cash bail be given back to them.Rotich last month maintained he was unlawfully charged in connection with fraud at the multibillion-shilling Arror and Kimwarer dams.Rotich was in 2019 accused of flouting procurement procedures in awarding a contract worth billions of shillings for the construction of the two dams to Italian firm CMC de Ravenna.He called for the multiple counts that include abuse of office, conspiracy to defraud the public, failure to comply with guidelines relating to procurement, and committing an offence of financial misconduct quashed.According to Rotich in court papers, the alleged procurement violations can only be committed by the accounting officer or employees in the procuring entity - the Kerio Valley Development Authority. The former CS argued the National Treasury or himself had no role to play in procurement matters of a procuring entity, otherwise, it would defeat the very purpose of securing accountability in procurement matters.The former CS claims that the prosecution documents demonstrate there was prior planning including a Cabinet directive dated August 21, 2009, for implementation of the Arror Dam. According to him, it is the duty of  KVDA and the oversight ministry to ensure that procurement procedures, which include project planning, are adhered to. Rotich said he was authorised by law to sign all financing agreements on behalf of the government of Kenya. This was done after legal clearance by the Attorney General."
481,"Kingi wants Coast party, ODM future under threat","Raila Odinga's stranglehold on the Coast faces a major threat after Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi joined the push for a regional party.For the first time, Kingi - an influential ODM stalwart - openly declared the Coast region must settle on its own political party by June this year.Kingi's move has opened a new  battlefront with his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho and sibling rivalry is likely to complicate ODM's fortunes.Joho, an ODM deputy leader, is seen as ODM's face at the Coast. The other deputy party leader is Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya.Kingi has often launched  ferocious verbal attacks on Deputy President William Ruto, claiming he is planning to divide the Coast region.“The people in the region are tired of being treated like second-class citizens during every poll and we demand to be recognised as we have more than 1.7 million registered voters,” Kingi said.The second-term governor's support for creation of a political vehicle for the region could also heighten temperatures and Raila's troops are expected to launch a counter-offensive.Kingi spoke during the burial of former Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga over the weekend.He appeared to warn the region against warming up to Ruto's United Democratic Alliance.The party symbolised by a wheelbarrow  has been associated with Ruto as part of his fall back for 2022 and reports of a scheme to sponsor small regional parties to neutralise ODM.“I thank Coastal leaders for not attending the United Democratic Alliance launch. Coast will not be used to fill the baskets of others,” Kingi said.With an aggressive onslaught from Ruto, whose allies are spearheading calls for a regional party, Raila's party is said to be facing a bleak future in the region.""It will no longer be business as usual for ODM  at the Coast,"" observed political risk analyst Dismus Mokua said.Mokua said Ruto has an elaborate plan to back regional parties and then lure them into a coalition with him ahead of 2022.""This creation of tribal parties is being advanced by Ruto's allies who fear falling by the wayside to popular parties in 2022,"" Mokua said.Kingi has previously been linked to a political plan by Ruto to firm up his grip on the Coast although he has often dismissed the claims.Some of Kingi's handlers are said to be secretly meeting Ruto in what is seen as a plan to win over the Kilifi governor as the DP rolls out a Coast takeover.However, Raila's allies have dismissed any imminent popularity threat posed by calls for the formation of a regional party, saying ODM is the party to beat.It lost badly in the Mswambeni by-election to the independent candidate backed by Ruto.“The ODM party is the most popular party at the Coast and indeed across the country. Those who are trying to divide the people of the Coast through the creation of a regional outfit will not succeed,"" Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir said.Nassir, the chairman of the National Assembly's Public Investments Committee, said no attempt by selfish politicians will diminish ODM's fortunes at the Coast.“We have an elaborate plan on how we shall strengthen the ODM party across the Coast region and completely annihilate leaders trying to dictate our political future,” he said.Joho has warned the plan to form a regional party is a scheme by Ruto to divide the region's votes and advance his 2022 presidential bid without any benefits for the Coast people.“Formation of a new political party will only divide the people further and undermine the region's unity in ODM, which has enabled them to push our agenda as a united region on the national stage,” Joho said.On Monday Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa reiterated that leaders from the  Coast must unite and form a single party that will drive the interests of the people of the region.“It is time we must come together and think of how we shall create a political party that will fight for the rights of the coastal nation,” she said, adding that having its own party will be an honour for the Coast.(Edited by V.

482,South Africa shuts land borders over Covid-19 spread,"South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that its land borders will be closed to most travelers until 15 February, in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus.In a televised address on Monday night, President Ramaphosa said the pandemic in South Africa is currently at its most devastating, with infection numbers far exceeding the peak experienced in the first wave.He said there have been nearly 190,000 reported infections since New Year’s Day, and there are currently more than 15,000 people in the hospital with Covid-19.The province of KwaZulu Natal has seen the most cases per head of population in recent weeks, but Mr Ramaphosa said infection numbers in Gauteng are growing exponentially and are expected to increase further as travelers return from their holidays.Many restrictions put in place at the end of December will be extended.The ban on alcohol sales remains in force, beaches and parks in hotpots remain shut, and social gatherings are still banned.President Ramaphosa warned that funerals continue to be super-spreader events.“Funerals have become a death trap for many of our people,” he said, as he urged people to stay at home.President Ramaphosa said the vaccine programme that South Africa plans to undertake will be the most ambitious logistical project in the country’s history.He said that 20 million doses of the vaccine had already been secured, for delivery in the coming months, and that negotiations are ongoing with a number of different manufacturers."
483,Atwoli accuses TSC of reluctance to end standoff with Knut,"Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli says the Teachers Service Commission has thwarted his efforts to end its acrimonious relationship with the Kenya National Union of Teachers.The trade unionist on Monday said the commission has refused to resolve the matter, adding that twice, he has sought an audience with the President over the issue. He was responding to a social media post by former Gichugu MP Martha Karua who accused Cotu of failing to stand in solidarity with Knut.Karua and Atwoli weighed in on the matter days after former Prime Minister Raila Odinga attacked the TSC for attempts to kill the once-giant teachers' union.In a strongly worded statement on his 76th birthday, the ODM leader said: ""Through a series of intentional actions, the TSC has disabled and is now en route to killing Knut.""""The teachers may have been subdued and gone silent as a monumental movement they built from scratch since 1957, and which they took pride in, is brought to its knees. But they are certainly not happy.""The raging labour dispute began in 2018 and has since seen the membership of the union shrink from a high of 187,000 to 23,000. The standoff was occasioned by disagreements on teacher promotions, registration regulations and appraisal.“As secretary general of the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Kenya), I thought it wise to make clarification on the issue to avoid miscommunication and misrepresentation of facts,” Atwoli's statement reads.He said they have held at least six meetings with the Labour CS to discuss the standoff, but the TSC snubbed them.Atwoli also noted that the standoff has seen Cotu push the Education committee in Parliament to open an enquiry into the matter but the directions offered were not implemented.He said that the matter has also caught the attention of international labour organisations—ILO and the Global International Trade Union Confederation.“Twice, we have convened meetings for all general secretaries of Cotu(K) affiliate unions to discuss the issue above after which, in all meetings, the general secretaries came up with resolutions to be sent to the President for consideration,” he said."
484,"Court orders compensation of 3,000 families evicted from Wilson","More than 3,000 families who were wrongfully evicted from the famous Mitumba village near Wilson Airport got relief after the Supreme Court ordered that they be compensated.In a judgment delivered via email, the apex court directed that the matter be taken back to the High Court, which will determine how much they will be paid.“These proceedings are hereby remitted to the trial court, with instructions that appropriate reliefs be crafted and granted in accordance,” the judgment reads.In the case, Mitubell Welfare Society challenged their eviction by the Kenya Airports Authority in 2011.The court noted that the eviction violated a court order. It also noted that during that eviction, residents' properties were destroyed.“This court cannot close its eyes to these uncontroverted findings on record. Actions by state organs, carried out in flagrant disregard for court orders, do undermine our constitutional order, more so if they result in the violation of citizens’ rights,” the court ruled.However, it declined to give them orders requiring the state to furnish the trial court with current state policies and programmes on provision of shelter and access to housing. The judges ruled that such orders ought not to have involved non- state actors, who were not parties to the suit.The judges were of the opinion that an illegal occupation of private land cannot create prescriptive rights over that land in favour of the occupants. However, that cannot be said to be illegal occupation of public land, they said.“To the contrary, we are of the considered opinion that where the landless occupy public land and establish homes thereon, they acquire not title to the land but a protectable right to housing over the same,” the court ruled.The judges further ruled that the right to housing over public land crystallises by virtue of a long period of occupation by people who have established homes and raised families on the land.“This right derives from the principle of equitable access to land under Article 60 (1) (a) of the Constitution. Faced with an eviction on grounds of public interest, such potential evictees have a right to petition the Court for protection,” the court held.It was their opinion that the protection need not necessarily be in the form of an order restraining the state agency from evicting the occupants, given the fact that the eviction may be entirely justifiable in the public interest.Lawyers for the victims welcomed the ruling. ""This is a big win for the right to housing and freedom from forced evictions in Kenya,"" said Ochiel Dudley, one of the advocates for Mitubell."
485,Governor Njuki's Sh34m graft case referred to High Court,"The High Court will now determine whether Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki and 20 others can be charged under the Anti-corruption Act in a Sh34 million graft case.Trial magistrate Douglas Ogoti said in a ruling that the superior court will give direction on the matter.Ogoti made the decision after defence lawyers sought clarity on which Act their clients were charged under. The charge sheet says they will be tried under the Penal Code and the Anti-corruption Act.The magistrate said that the court has no jurisdiction to make the decision as argued by the defence counsels.The court also disallowed an application by the defence lawyers seeking to refer the case to Tharaka Nithi. Ogoti said that he has no power to refer the matter to the scene where the offence occurred.The lawyers said the Director of Public Prosecution should have charged the suspects in Embu, Meru or Tharaka Nithi to cut down their expenses.They argued that the magistrate should not have allowed the suspects to plead to charges or even impose bail terms including barring the governor from his office.The decision of the court means the trial of the governor and his co-accused will have to wait until the High Court makes a determination on issues raised. Njuku and 20 others were charged with conspiracy to defraud the county government of Sh34 million through an unprocedural tendering process.The governor was also charged with another count of conflict of interest in a tender worth Sh34 million.The tender was for the supply, installation and commissioning of a solid waste incinerator."
486,93% new cases asymptomatic - Health ministry,"Ninety-three per cent of the 63 new Covid-19 cases reported on Monday were asymptomatic, meaning they are unaware and can spread the disease.The new cases were from a sample size of 2,134 tested in 24 hours, representing a positivity rate of 2.9 per cent, the Health ministry said.The new cases comprised of 37 men and 26 women aged between eight years and 73 yearsAll are Kenyans except six foreign nationals.The number of deaths continued to rise after three more patients succumbed to the virus, raising the fatalities to 1,713.“There are 687 patients admitted in various health facilities and 2,190 on home isolation and care.

487,Kenya staring at debt crisis - Controller of Budget,"The Controller of Budget has warned of a debt crisis if the National Treasury continues to borrow to meet budget deficits.Margaret Nyakang’o argues, ""Increased public borrowing may result in undesirable fiscal consequences.”Public debt sustainability indicators already demonstrate Kenya faces a high risk of debt distress.President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration only has room to borrow Sh590 billion to hit the Sh9 trillion public debt ceiling MPs set in October 2019.Next year’s budget deficit is projected to be about Sh1 trillion, opening a Sh317 billion budget hole.The latest Treasury reports show public debt stood at Sh8.41 trillion as of August 2020.Nyakang’o warns  the debts may attract high interest rates, increase inflation and overburden future generations.“The Kenya shilling may also depreciate against the world’s major currencies due to demand for foreign currency to service foreign currency-denominated debt,"" she said.The budget controller raised the concerns in the review of the national government spending for the first quarter of the financial year.The COB wants the National Treasury to “take appropriate measures to ensure public debt remains at sustainable levels.”Nyakang’o says a boost in revenue by expanding domestic tax sources to meet government obligations would suffice. “While borrowing, the government should ensure that its financing needs and payment obligations are at the lowest market cost and with prudent risk,” the COB advised.Debt repayment consumed Sh138.8 billion for the three months under review, which was 40 per cent of revenue collected during the review period.Treasury CS Ukur Yatani recently sought to allay fears Kenya would default on its loans, citing a projected repayment plan for 10 years.Apart from the debt, COB reprimanded the National Treasury over development allocations short of the required 30 per cent share of Sh2.9 trillion budget.Development projects were hit in the current financial year with the allocation of Sh633 billion.The allocation is 21.7 per cent of the budget, with the recurrent expenditure taking up Sh2.3 trillion, representing 88.3 per cent.The Public Finance Management Act, 2012, provides that a minimum of 30 per cent of the national and county government budget shall be allocated to development.“The outlined proportions are in contravention of the PFM Act, 2012. CoB advises the National Treasury to ensure that allocations towards development expenditure are within the law,” Nyakang’o said.The report further shows that state officers continued to be on a spending spree despite the call by National Treasury to focus on the Covid-19 response.Travel consumed Sh2.7 billion in the period under review,  a decline compared to the Sh3.53 billion spent in the same period last year.Local travel took up Sh2.04 billion, whereas Sh628.02 million was spent on foreign travel, a difference of about Sh800 million.Government agencies spent Sh726.9 million on hospitality – largely entertainment -  during the period under review, and Sh43.6 billion on ""other expenses"".The President’s office was the top spender on hospitality at Sh209 million,  followed by Foreign Affairs at Sh136.8 million.The Sports department followed at Sh56.3 million; National Assembly (Sh19.8 million); Judiciary (Sh19.5 million); Judicial Service Commission (Sh18.54 million) and EACC (Sh12.6 million).Training took up Sh109.24 million; motor vehicle maintenance (Sh296.5 million); maintenance of other assets (Sh99.4 million); legal fees (Sh132 million); and advertising (Sh59 million).Expenditure reports from Ifmis and those from Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) indicated that some generated and spent their income in carrying out their activitiesThe CoB report has further revealed an unprecedented increase in spending on pensions and gratuities.The amounts went up by 37 per cent to Sh119.9 billion, compared with Sh86.9 billion for the last financial year.Of these, Treasury released Sh20.4 billion, Sh5 billion higher compared to the same period last year.The budget boss has also decried slow disbursements by the National Treasury saying the situation is affecting budget implementation.Nyakang’o says the Treasury should have ordinarily released 25 per cent of the annual estimates but had only released 17.9 per cent during the period.Total exchequer issues for the period amounted to Sh494.67 billion, a decrease compared to Sh571 billion recorded in the same period of FY 2019-20. “It would be expected that by the end of the first quarter, the exchequer releases should be around 25 per cent of the annual estimates,"" the CoB said.She said that from her analysis of financial reports submitted by ministries, Treasury is to blame for the low expenditure and pending bills at the end of the year.“Delay in the disbursement of exchequers affects the implementation of programmes and plans by government entities and subsequently affects the timely delivery of services,"" Nyakang’o  said.The Budget controller thus wants the National Treasury to release funds to MDAs based on their annual work plans and cash flow projections.Even so, the Exchequer may have saved up to Sh330 million in the first three months of the financial year.The savings were attributed to a lower budget for the Auditor General and  ending benefits to former President Daniel Moi, deceased. A number of state officers, including President  Kenyatta and DP William Ruto, took pay cuts to save monies for Covid-19 response.(Edited by V.

488,Can Ruto win Mt Kenya without Uhuru blessing?,"Deputy President William Ruto appears to have given up getting the support of his boss Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022.Instead, Ruto is working on a strategy to vanquish both the President and his newfound soulmates by decisively beating Uhuru even in his own Mt Kenya backyard.UhuRuto was powered into leadership largely through the majoritarian vote basket of the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin.This means their  acrimonious divorce - a long time coming -  that clearly played out at the weekend could deal Ruto a staggering blow.On Sunday, a confident Ruto told off the President for suggesting it’s time for other tribes to lead and dared him and the handshake team to a political duel.“We are ready and we know leadership comes from God and the people. Let's meet at the ballot,” he declared.But can Mt Kenya defy Uhuru and vote for Ruto against the President’s wishes?In 2010,  powerful minister John Michuki declared Uhuru the undisputed kingpin of the Agikuyu people.He said, “Anyone who wants to talk to the Agikuyu should speak with Uhuru.”However, allies of the DP believe Ruto will successfully defy ethnic boundaries and set a historical record.They said Ruto has built a close relationship with the people and they would not abandon him.“He [Ruto] will not get the support of Mt Kenya alone but the entire country. We are moving away from tribal blocs. People want to support someone who will change their lives,” Nandi senator Samson Cherargei said.However, Kikuyu Council of Elders chairman Wachira Kiago said people from Mt Kenya region will be waiting for Uhuru’s direction on the path they should take politically.“Every region has its leader and in Mt Kenya, it is Uhuru. The silent majority are waiting for their leader to speak,” he told the Star.KCE secretary general Peter Munga said Ruto would not go anywhere in Mt Kenya region without the President.“He is about to be dismantled this year,” Munga told the StarHowever, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wah strongly disagrees.“We need to change the narrative and the conversation of our political engagement away from ethnicity and personality-based politics,” Ichung'wah said.He said Kenyans will vote for their leaders based on the pledges they make and their track records.This was also the position of Embakasi West MP George Theuri.Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa maintained Mt Kenya people will support the Deputy President because of his plans for them and not because other leaders tell them who to vote for.“Ruto has worked closely with the people from Mt Kenya region, even before the handshake. He is likeable in that region and the people there will support him in 2022,” he said.Barasa added that 70 per cent of the people in Mt Kenya will support Ruto even without Uhuru’s blessings and the number would go up drastically if the President endorses his deputy.“We will not wish Uhuru away because we still need his support,” he said.Political analyst Kariuki Ngunjiri said the Deputy President does not need any endorsements to get support from Uhuru's base, but if it came, it would perhaps influence the undecided voters.“The Deputy President has been able to create close friendship with Uhuru's political base. Over time he has built a stable grassroots organisational infrastructure that sees him as the most suitable successor to the President,” he added.Ngunjiri further added that the people of the mountain have been with Ruto for the last eight years even without the accompaniment of the President.“Ruto has sustained his bond with the people of Mt Kenya by visiting them almost on every consecutive weekend for funds drive events,” he pointed out.Political commentator Daniel Orogo also believes Ruto will get a significant amount of votes from Mt  Kenya region but the votes will not be a bloc.“Young Kikuyus who have historically been disenfranchised by the system and as result have suffered a massive unemployment believe in the hustler narrative and Ruto’s presidency to offer hope,” Orogo said.He points out, however, that it would not be an easy task for Ruto to win the hearts of Mt Kenya region.(Edited by V.

489,"‘Even amidst pandemic, diplomacy cannot stop’","Kenya and Japan have had long-standing diplomatic ties over the years.On Tuesday, Japan’s Foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi will visit Kenya to discuss, among other issues, foreign policy; the role the country will play in the next TICAD which will be held in Tunisia in 2022; and cooperation as Kenya’s membership to the UNSC begins this January.The Star interviewed Japan’s Ambassador to Kenya Ryoichi Horie on Kenya-Japan relations ahead of the visit.It has been one and a half years since your posting as Ambassador Extraordinary Plenipotentiary of Japan to Kenya. What is your experience working in Kenya, and what have been your achievements so far?It was 1982 that I started my career with Africa, working in Nigeria. I had also visited more than 10 African countries while I was working at the African Department in Tokyo. In 2012, I was appointed Ambassador of Japan to Sudan and worked there for one and a half years. In July 2019, I came back to this beautiful and promising continent as Ambassador of Japan to Kenya. The past one and a half years in Kenya have been full of excitement. Kenya is one of the most important countries for Japan in Africa. For instance, Japan has extended the largest amount of ODA [official development assistance] to Kenya among the sub-Saharan African countries. Since my posting, I signed a number of ODA projects, totalling to about Sh100 billion. Being the ambassador to such an important and vibrant country has given me great joy and pleasure.What would you say have been your most memorable events thus far?In the course of my duties, I have visited different parts of the country which I enjoyed very much. Before March 2020, I often attended various ceremonies held in different counties. One of the most memorable ones was the Ground Breaking Ceremony for the Dongo Kundu Special Economic Zone, which President Uhuru Kenyatta also attended. During the event, my wife and I sang a song to entertain the participants.Our singing was warmly welcomed and was a pleasant surprise for the audience and the President himself.Besides this kind of major event, I also attend the handing-over ceremonies of the Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects (GGP) as often as possible, as I regard the GGP projects especially important in improving the lives of the ordinary Kenyan people. GGP projects do not boast about the amount of money to be spent on the projects but instead emphasise the impact these projects will have on the lives of the people on the ground. Quintessential examples of the GGP projects include the provision of buildings for primary schools, hospitals, as well as the establishment of a vocational centre and a Fruit Value Addition Facility. Of course, we have all heard about your singing. But does it have a significance beyond the enjoyment of those who listen to the songs at the various events?Our diplomatic activities have not been spared from the restraints posed by the “new normal” since March 2020. One of the most affected areas is cultural diplomacy. I have gained the appellation of “singing ambassador”, having sung some Kiswahili songs, such as “Malaika” and “Jambo Bwana”, with my wife at the abovementioned events. I believe music is a great tool to connect people, given its universal character, which is the reason I incorporate singing into my diplomatic activity. The Covid pandemic forced me to alter my cultural activities and shift them online to fit the new circumstances. Recently I collaborated with my good friend, Eric Wainaina, singing his renowned patriotic song “Daima”, and he uploaded the video on his YouTube channel, which you can check out. What I would like to reiterate is that even amidst this global pandemic, diplomacy cannot stop. We need to move forward even in this new and unusual manner of conducting diplomacy.Kenya has been hit hard by the virus. What kind of support Japan has extended to Kenya so far? When I heard that the very first case of Covid-19 was detected in Kenya on March 12, 2020, I imagined the worst-case scenario from the viewpoint of risk management. There were possibilities that food and other essentials would disappear from the shops, as witnessed in some other countries, and some social unrest would occur. However, the Kenyan people startled me with their high morale and discipline. The government intervened at an early stage and the people diligently followed the guidelines, such as wearing masks and sanitising their hands. Shops operated in an orderly manner without any scarcity of essentials and shoppers demonstrated mutual respect. However, given the impact of the rampant deadly virus in other parts of the world, we cannot ignore the fact that there is lack of necessary equipment in this country to thoroughly fight against the deadly virus. Thus, we decided to support Kenya’s fight in various ways. What concrete steps did you take in this regard?First, we provided PCR testing kits with the capacity of 50,000 tests to Kemri, the very institution we supported since its inception, which has now become the frontrunner for Kenya’s fight against Covid-19. In addition, I signed four Exchange of Notes to increase Kenya’s capacity to counter the virus, including the procurement of medical equipment and the provision of grant aid for the development of electronic power distribution system. The amount of Covid-related aid Japan has provided to Kenya so far has added up to more than Sh10 billion. I understand that Kenya has dealt with this pandemic fairly well and these days, the positivity rate is below 5 per cent, the criteria specified by WHO. I am proud of this country that it has decided to live with the virus and not completely lock down the cities and restrict peoples’ activities, and still manage to control the spread of the virus. Observing the Kenyan people’s arduous efforts, I am determined to support the brave decision of the Government of Kenya and work closely with the people to come out of this global menace in a more robust shape. Therefore, Japan will continuously pump up its support to Kenya, especially in economic areas.What brings the Japanese Foreign Minister to Kenya at this time of pandemic, when there is little international travel? The Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr [Toshimitsu] Motegi, is visiting Nairobi from 12th to 13th. The physical presence of the minister amidst the global pandemic acutely reflects the significance of Kenya for Japanese diplomacy, as well as Japan’s high expectation for Kenya in its economic robustness and global leadership at this difficult time. There are mainly three objectives for the Foreign Minister’s visit. First, Japan would like to work closely with Kenya in Japan’s key foreign policy, ‘Free and Open Indo-Pacific (Foip)’. Second, Japan expects Kenya to play a leading role in the next Ticad (Tokyo International Conference on African Development), which will be held in Tunisia in 2022. Last but not least, Japan wants to strengthen the cooperation with Kenya on global issues upon the commencement of Kenya’s membership to the UNSC this January. These three agendas were significant enough to drive the minister to visit Kenya, despite the risks from the virus. Minister Motegi is scheduled to pay a courtesy call on President Kenyatta and to have bilateral meetings with some Cabinet Secretaries to further deepen our partnerships. Tell us more about these objectives, beginning with Foip (Free and Open Indo–Pacific) and what it hopes to achieve?‘Foip’ is a concept that was first announced in Nairobi in 2016 at the occasion of Ticad 6, the first Ticad to be held outside Japan. In this strategy, Japan aims to promote stability and prosperity of the international community by improving the connectivity of Asia and Africa through free and open Indian and Pacific Ocean. This strategy shares an identical goal with the Kenyan Blue Economy Strategy, in which Kenya aims to promote sustainability and prosperity through oceans. Japan, very much resonating this auspicious strategy, has been standing side by side with the Kenyan government and promoting this strategy by co-hosting the first Blue Economy Conference in 2018, and providing various support for the newly established Kenya Coast Guard, which is expected to play a pivotal role in promoting maritime security in the region. What can you point to in terms of actual projects or programmes which ordinary Kenyans can look forward to as benefits arising from all this?One of the key projects in Foip is the development of the Mombasa port and the Dongo Kundu Special Economic Zone (SEZ), which is adjacent to the port. Mombasa port is a lifeline not only for Kenya but also for countries neighbouring her. The development of the port contributes to the prosperity of the region, overarching East Africa to Middle East. Furthermore, the development of the port, combined with the SEZ, is the biggest source of employment in the area. Our investment not only targets immovable infrastructure but also human capital as well. We are seeking to nurture a future generation who will be the foundation of the stability and prosperity in this region and for the international community.Turning to the Ticad, you said Ticad 8 will be held in Tunisia in 2022. What should Kenya expect at this conference?Ticad has been an advancing essence of Japan’s commitments in Africa. It moved from Japan for the first time in 2016, when Kenya hosted the conference here in Nairobi.It will again come back to this continent, this time in Tunisia in 2022. The main focus will be on global health, the vulnerability of which was grossly revealed in the global pandemic. We expect Kenya to play a leading role in this prominent conference as a previous host of the conference and a great contributor in Yokohama in Ticad 7. The summer Olympics are now scheduled to be held in Tokyo in 2021, after postponement in 2020 due to the pandemic. What can you tell us about this? Last year, people all over the world were forced to live in a dimmer world not only because of demises of loved ones but also the suspension of people’s hope: the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Games have been a great hope for human beings for centuries. It is the first time in history that this world athletic event was postponed, although there were five of them that were cancelled due to wars. The suspension of the Games devastated athletes who had devoted their time and energy to advancing their skills for the past four years. Some of them may lose their dreams to become Olympians due to this drastic pause. We won’t repeat this tragedy again this year. The Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Suga Yoshihide, in his first press conference of this year, reaffirmed that Japan is determined to host the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2021 against the tireless rampage of the virus. The Prime Minster projected that he shall deliver this dream and hope to the world through the games and would advance preparations thoroughly to carry out games that are safe and secure. Probably the appearance of the games will be totally different from what we know, with unusually less crowded venues, less cheering while wearing face masks and sanitising of hands. However, the core concepts that are the foundation of the Games will remain intact, shining the zenith of human being’s ability and delivering hope all over the world. Edited by T Jalio"
490,"Do not let politicians ruin Kenya, Maraga urges judges","Retired Chief Justice David Kenani Maraga on Monday challenged judges to stand firm and not let the political class plunge the country into chaos.“You live in this country, and you have seen the drums of political war beaten already. If you waver and do the wrong thing and this country descends into chaos, God will never forgive you,” he said.Maraga reminded them that they have been given the power to be guardians of the Constitution, and they should not let Kenyans down by bending to political whims.“I have heard sometimes politicians say they are better off because they are elected. I want to tell you that according to constitutional architecture they have no better power than what you have. I want to urge that you don’t let the people of Kenya down.”In a statement seen to encourage the judges, the retired CJ said that as long as they stand firm and do the right thing, God and the people of Kenya will defend them the same way they defended him in the last four years.At exactly 10.44am Monday, Maraga handed over instruments of power to acting CJ Philomena Mwilu. Mwilu will now act as CJ until the Judiciary hires a new one.At 11.01am Maraga removed his rob and wore his suit to show that he is now a civilian. He acknowledged greetings from Judiciary staff as he headed to his car.He handed over government stores to Chief Registrar of Judiciary Anne Amadi. This included an official car, a national flag and a number plate CJ1 to symbolise official handing over of power. He drove off in his private car.Maraga under whose term the Judiciary faced controversies, will be remembered for among many things nullifying the presidential election in 2017. The move set the Judiciary on a collision course with the Executive.Consequently, President Uhuru Kenyatta called Supreme Court justices 'wakora' and promised to revisit the troublesome Judiciary. He was re-elected in a no-contest rerun.In 2020, Maraga rubbed top leaders and politicians the wrong way when he condemned what he called persistent interference with the independence of the Judiciary. Though he didn’t enjoy the best of relationships with the Executive, the retired CJ on Monday thanked the Executive and the Legislature for the work they have been able to accomplish as co-equal arms of government in the service of the Kenyan public.“I urge you to continue living by the constitutional edict of robust independence and constructive interdependence, which the Judiciary has embraced as a key philosophical and operational principle,” he said.He called on development partners and Kenyans to stand with the Judiciary for the stability of the nation.“I urge you all to continue giving them your unwavering support, and to keep praying for them so that justice and the rule of law can continue flourishing in our beloved country. ““We must continue to invest in a strong, independent, fair, and effective Judiciary bearing in mind that sustained economic prosperity and the long-term political stability of this nation can only be guaranteed if the rule of law reigns.”Maraga thanked God for allowing him to serve in the Judiciary for 18 years in different capacities.“I want to start by thanking God almighty for the opportunity to serve the people of Kenya and the guidance he gave,” he said.Maraga recounted how he chose his faith over the job of CJ.“In my interview for the position of Chief Justice, given the fact that the Supreme Court must hear and determine presidential election petitions within 14 days, I was asked whether I would sit on a Saturday, my Sabbath day. I understood the question to require of me to make a choice between getting the job of Chief Justice and living out my faith.”“I determined to live out my faith and said I would not sit on Saturday. God gave me the job and fought all my battles throughout the term I served as CJ. I don’t know how to thank him for considering me worthy of his grace.”He thanked his family for their support. “Throughout you [wife, children] bore the brunt of the attacks and threats against me. I sincerely thank you and will not take that for granted,” Maraga said.He also thanked Kenyans for their unwavering support.“Your solidarity in moments of great adversity and peril, and your steadfast defence in moments of trials and tribulations, only strengthened my resolve and enabled me to serve you,” he said.During the four years he served as CJ, Maraga appointed 94 judicial staff and processed 172 cases on complaints on judicial officers.He opened 22 court buildings, most of which were supported by World Bank, and he chaired 93 JSC meetings. He also recommended the appointment of 69 judges, recruited 111 magistrates, appointed 94 judicial staff and processed and concluded cases against 172 judicial officers.Mwilu praised her former boss for exemplary leadership.“Yours has been a life of service, a professional and personal example characterised by integrity, fidelity to the rule of law and most importantly obedience to God,” she said as she bid him goodbye. “I have gained immensely from working with you. Encouragement in moments of weakness. As president of our court, you led us with knowledge.”Mwilu said Maraga is leaving a proud legacy, especially on judicial independence, protecting and entrenching the rule of law. She promised to carry on from where he left off.“For whatever period it will please God for me to serve as CJ, we will build on your legacy.”"
491,I'm not in fight with Uhuru over my BBI letter — Kang'ata,"Embattled Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata has stuck to his guns that the BBI is unpopular in Mt Kenya and insinuated that he is ready to pay the price for his views.Addressing journalists at Parliament Buildings on Monday, Kang'ata said the BBI is facing ""systematic political problems"" that need to be addressed to save the government from ""embarrassment"".“I respect the presidency. I will continue being loyal to the party but notwithstanding that, I think I still have an obligation to talk the truth… the truth is there is a systemic political problem that needs some intervention in our county of Murang’a and in the larger Mt Kenya,” Kang'ata said.And in what could worsen his woes in Jubilee and widen rift with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Kang'ata has sided with Deputy President William Ruto’s call for a multiple-choice referendum to save the BBI from total rejection.Late last month, he penned a radical letter to Uhuru saying that only two in every 10 people in the President’s backyard support the BBI. He urged the President to personally take charge of popularising the document in the region, lest he be left with egg on the face.The senator said he was ready to leave his current position of Majority Whip if the party decides to de-whip him on the basis of the letter.“If for any reason that [removal] was to occur, there is nothing I can do. I just thank the party for that period I have served them as their leader and I will remain respectful to my superiors and authorities,” he said.""I cannot enter an arena of fighting with my boss but I only strongly believe it is important as political leaders to say the truth, to report the truth and to be honest and candid in our endeavour when it comes to matters like this one, which has the potentiality to embarrass the government.”He evaded question on whether he was planning to ditch the President's faction for Ruto's, saying he is a whip for Jubilee Party and does not believe in 'factional' leadership.“As to whether I am shifting my political allegiance, let me tell Kenyans, myself as a whip, I believe in a one united Jubilee. I work for the Jubilee Party. I work without considering those factions. I don’t believe in hatred. I believe in peace and harmony.”The Murang’a senator, however, said he wrote the letter in good faith and reiterated his loyalty to the President despite Uhuru’s outburst last week about the letter. He said he will continue supporting the Jubilee administration.Kang'ata said the perception that the BBI was being pushed by a faction of Jubilee Party and use of provincial administration to advance it has made the drive unmarketable in the region.“I got the perception that the BBI is a project of a faction of Jubilee. The impression I got is that the people want the agenda to be pushed by a one, united Jubilee and not weaponised for politics. They want a BBI that is non-politicised,” he said.He insisted that he made the observation after meeting residents, opinion leaders and professionals from Murang'a who expressed their reservations about the BBI.He said he has the obligation to tell the government the truth and hit out at National Assembly Majority leader Amos Kimunya for attacking him and not telling the President the truth.“My survey was limited to Murang’a but I did what we call triangulation and I realised that what happens in Murang’a appears to echo in the other counties in the region,” he said."
492,"Ex-DCI boss Muhoro had no interest in disputed Sh20m property, court told","Former DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro did not influence the arrest of George Jonathan Maara and Peter John Kamau Ruhangi over a property dispute in Kiambu county, a court has heard. An officer investing malicious damage to the Sh20 million property belonging to Isaac Maina said all suspects were charged after clearance by the public prosecutor. Joseph Mucheru, a detective from the Directorate of the Criminal Investigation's office, made the remarks during cross-examination by defence lawyer Kiraithe Wandungi.Muhoro was in April 2017 replaced by George Kinoti before he was nominated Kenya’s ambassador to Malaysia on July 24, 2018.In the case, the politicians are charged with malicious damage to the property alongside Stephen Muiruri Ngatho, John Maina Waithera and James Githere Mburu. They have denied committing the offence on March 13, 2016 at WonderJoy Party World in Ridgeways in Kiambu.Maara is separately accused of misuse of his licensed firearm. He allegedly used his Ceska pistol to threaten guards Rimon Lientikiei and Richard Mutisya.Mucheru told the court that he took over the investigation file from his colleague following his transfer to another station.  Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku adjourned the case after prosecution witness Isaac Nyoike, a chief valuer with Nairobi county, concluded his evidence-in-chief.Witness Isaac Nyoike, another chief valuer with Nairobi county, told the court that the land on which the property was destroyed belonged to WanderJoy Party World. The defunct City Council of Nairobi gave the company temporary use of the property. Nyoike said Wanderjoy received a Temporary Occupation License of the two acres of land block 27/326 in 2011 for a leasehold of 25 years.He told the court the General Purpose Committee met on April 14, 2011 to issue the lease. The committee was chaired by Simba Arati, currently Dagoretti North MP.The court heard that Wanderjoy reclaimed the swampy parcel over four years. Nyoike said the lease was to take effect on January 1, 2008, and the property be used for recreational purposes, wedding and conferences. The company could only construct car sheds to shield vehicles from harsh weather conditions.  The complainant was also required to pay Sh38,000 annual rent.WanderJoy proprietor Maina owns two-and-half acres adjacent to the place his damaged installation partially occupies. The land is not developed and is only used as a parking lot.According to CCTV footage being reviewed by CID sleuths, the demolition targeted the wall and liquified gas installation in the premises. Security agents fear the commotion could have triggered a potentially devastating explosion.The case will be mentioned on February 18 to confirm whether parties have filed and exchanged written submissions.  (edited by o. owino)"
493,"Two dead, two injured in Baringo road accident","Two people died and two others were injured in a black spot road crash in Baringo along Kabarnet-Iten road on Sunday night.“The vehicle overturned and rolled several times before plunging down the steep cliff,"" Baringo Central deputy OCPD Chrispinius Ogutu said on Monday.Mathew Malakwen, 30, the driver of the Subaru Impreza, died on the spot. Passenger Jonah Malakwen, 26, died while being rushed to Baringo County Referral Hospital in Kabernet.“We could not tell where the victims were coming from but they were heading to Elgeyo-Marakwet county. Their names suggest they could be relatives,” the deputy OCPD Chrispinius Ogutu said.Ogutu said the car could have been speeding along the meandering road.The accident occurred near Kiboino trading centre, a black spot located along the deep meandering terrain across the Kerio Valley around 8.30pm.Ogutu said the other two passengers  - Mathew Kipchumba, 33, and Gideon Kemboi, 27 - survived and were were rescued by good Samaritans who took them to hospital. They were treated and discharged.There were no other passengers. The bodies were taken to Kabarnet hospital mortuary for postmortem.Ogutu warned motorists to be extra careful along sharp, winding roads, saying they can easily cause accidents.He recommended 40 to 60kph along the dangerous Baringo roads.Ten people have died in road accidents in Baringo since 2017.Four people -two children and two adults - were killed and several others injured after the driver of a Toyota Land Cruiser lost control along Airstrip Road near Kabarnet town on October 9.On October 5, popular Kalenjin musician Rhino Kaboom Amon Kipkirui, 27, died after his motorbike collided with a Probox along the Emining-Eldama-Ravine road.The driver of the Probox  and his wife escaped unhurt.In June 2017, three students of Lokichar Boys’ High school in Turkana county died on the spot after the driver of their 52-seater bus lost control and rolled off  Kapkokorwo cliff near Kabarnet town.(Edited by V.

494,Clinical officers turn to streets to push for deal signing,"Clinical officers on Monday held street demonstrations to have their return-to-work formula signed.They staged a peaceful procession from Uhuru Park to the Council of Governors offices in Westlands, Nairobi. This came after the governors’ body failed to sign the agreement reached on January 1.The clinicians accused the CoG of resorting to intimidation and hostility meted out to their striking members, adding that grievances cannot be solved through such tactics.The council has been reluctant to sign a return-to-work agreement for both the clinicians and nurses, with the documents lying at the Labour ministry as Kenyans continue to bear the brunt of the strike that entered its second month last week.Governor claim they were not consulted before the agreements were reached, a position the unions have dismissed.“On January 1 this year, we came out together with the CS of Health out of goodwill. After a lot of compromise, both sides were in agreement that we go back with a framework of how to address the serious grievances that concerned the working environment, which was not safe for ourselves and for the patients that we see,” KUCO chairman Peterson Wachira said.The union said Labour CS Simon Chelugui wrote a letter to all the organs and institutions that constituted the multi-agency committee directing them to send representatives who had the mandate to make decisions.They included officials from the Treasury, the SRC, the CoG, the Public Service Commission, the Health Ministry and the the Ministry of Public Service and Gender.“We sat with CoG representatives and agreed on the return-to-work formula and later they decided to go back on the same. We gave them 48 hours to resolve and sign but they refused. As if that was not enough, they decided to dismiss our members and to subject them to unfair labour practices in form of dismissals and show cause,” Wachira said. “There is no institution that is ultimately responsible for the health sector in this country. We want a framework where we know where the buck stops, having one centre where healthcare workers can take their grievances and be addressed to conclusion.”The clinical officers had called off their strike on January 1 but stayed away from work after the CoG failed to sign the document.The nurses, on the other hand, have been on strike since December 7, with talks between the various parties having been concluded last week. But the document remains unsigned as the two levels of government continues to huff and puff at the situation.According to KUCO secretary general George Gibore, the health services in the country lack coordinated leadership.“That is something that should be addressed in urgency so that we can have healthcare workers who are motivated, are happier to offer services because since devolution we have had numerous strikes amounting to 103,” Gibore said.Lab technologists joined in the strike last week, making an already bad situation even worse. The healthcare workers are demanding for quality personal protective equipment, risk allowance for frontline workers, comprehensive medical insurance cover and payment of members employed under the UHC programme, among other grievances.The CoG has maintained that the issues raised in the return-to-work formula have huge monetary implication that have neither been factored in the current budget nor the forthcoming financial year, hence will require a special conditional grant for each county to implement."
495,NCPB assures farmers of payment 24 hours after delivery,"The National Cereals and Produce Board has assured maize farmers of payment within 24 hours of delivery this year. NCPB managing director Joseph Kimote said on Monday all farmers who deliver grain that meets the required quality standards would be paid promptly.This is after reports that farmers have been shying away from selling maize to the board for fear of delayed payment.“Payment will be done within 24 hours upon delivery. We are therefore encouraging farmers to bring their maize to NCPB and get value for their crop,” he said in a statement.Kimote said the process of buying maize from farmers has been slow, largely because of the festivities, but hoped the pace will pick up as farmers start preparing land for the long rains planting season.NCPB is targeting to buy one million bags at a cost of Sh2,500 per 90 kg bag. Currently, millers and traders are buying maize at an average cost of Sh2,600 per bag.   Kimote said the board will also be paying pending bills for the 2017-18 maize deliveries. Eighty-nine farmers who were cleared by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission will be paid.""NCPB has received Sh147 million from the government to pay farmers for pending payments for the 2017-18 maize deliveries,"" he said. Kimote said the Sh147 million will be used to pay 68 farmers who have been cleared by the EACC but have not been paid for what they delivered to the board.  The board is expecting a further Sh384 million to pay the remaining 21 farmers.“We are working on the modalities on how to disburse the money to the farmers and the payment exercise will start as soon as possible,” he said.Kenya Farmers Association chairman Kipkorir Menjo said reforms at the board had helped stabilise maize prices in the market at the benefit of farmers.“By this time of the year, brokers would normally have brought a lot of maize into the country which would depress prices of local maize. But the new reforms have locked out unscrupulous traders, and they have not been bringing any maize during the harvesting season,” he said.Kimote said besides buying maize, NCPB is offering grain post-harvest services including drying, warehouse receipt system, weighing, aflatoxin testing and fumigation.All of these services are offered at affordable rates. For instance, drying a unit drop of moisture content costs Sh20 and aflatoxin testing charges at Sh1,500 per sample."
496,Senate Bill caps local borrowing by state at 30 per cent,"The government would be forced to rely on international lenders under a proposed Senate Bill capping local borrowing at 30 per cent.The draft Public Finance Management (Amendment) Bill compels the government to borrow only as much as 30 per cent of its intended amount from the local market, with 70 per cent coming from outside.Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura, who has sponsored the Bill, says local businesses and investors have been hit hard financially as they have been denied loans by local financial institutions in favour of the government.“This Bill basically seeks to cap domestic borrowing by government. The government is borrowing all the money [from the local market] to pay salaries and do all kinds of mundane things,” Mwaura said in his justification for the Bill.“We are coming up with a formula in law that says when the government needs Sh1 trillion, we can only borrow up to 30 per cent of that money locally,” he said.The Bill, which is currently in the pre-publication stage, is currently being scrutinised by Parliament legal experts before it is published and introduced in the Senate for first reading,“Government is now borrowing from all the banks and it is crowding out local investors. So anybody who has an idea - say they want to create a small cottage industry, build flats or any other economic idea that can generate income to the same government - they can no longer get money,”  Mwaura said.He added the government has been in competition with local investors for loans from banks and other financial institutions, thus stifling growth of businesses.As such, local industries, including manufacturing, have suffered. The situation, he said, has been exploited by informal lenders, otherwise known as shylocks, leading to exploitation of the borrowers.“Take the SGR for example. The Chinese have sold over Sh400 billion over the last year and the same moved through SGR but most of those containers are going back empty. It is essentially because we have nothing to sell to them,” he said.He added, “The government is borrowing money to do infrastructure but those roads are not benefitting the local manufacturer. They are not stimulating growth in terms of actual development other than opening up pathways for foreign goods to come to the market.”The situation, the legislator noted, has been aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic that has forced banks to deny individuals and businesses loans in favour of the government.(Edited by V.

497,Water firm denies claims it pollutes Lake Naivasha,"The Naivasha Water, Sewerage and Sanitation Company has denied claims that it is contributing to the pollution of Lake Naivasha.This comes after the company's sewer plant was identified as the main polluter of the lake, with studies indicating that it could not adequately treat human waste from the surrounding estates in the town.Studies indicate that the plant has been overwhelmed by the high population in Naivasha leading to the waste flowing into the lake.But the management of the Naivasha Water, Sewerage and Sanitation Company has dismissed the reports, terming its plant operational and very effective.Company CEO Nahashon Wahome said they had met the set parameters while treating the waste.Wahome however admitted that the sewer system in the town was overwhelmed due to the rise in population but maintained that the company's plant was fully operational.“The main pollutants of the lake are well-known as the water discharged into the lake from our plant is fully treated and not contaminated as alleged,” he said.Wahome said most of the faecal waste in the sewer plant was collected by a private institution that uses it to produce charcoal bricks for domestic use.But Lake Naivasha Water Resources User Association chairman Enock Kiminta said on Monday the plant could no longer handle high solid and water waste.He said studies indicated that there were high levels of coli and faecal in the water around the sewer plant.“We collected samples from various points around the lake and the results indicate that water flowing into the lake from the sewerage plant is highly contaminated,” he said.Kiminta said they had engaged the county government to upgrade the sewer plant that was constructed in the early 1980s.“The current sewer system was meant to serve around 50,000 people but this has increased tenfold and the waste is not fully treated, hence the current crisis,” he said.Earlier, Water Resources Authority subregional manager Jeremiah Nyaga said over 99 per cent of hotels and flower farms had adhered to the water treatment regulations.“The Water Resources Authority is impressed by the manner in which these flower farms are treating their solid and water waste which is in conformity with the law,” he said."
498,Why debt ceiling must cross Sh9 trillion,"Lawmakers have no alternative but to grant the National Treasury its wish to cross the Sh9 trillion public debt ceiling, the Parliamentary Budget Office has said.The budget office posits that with loan commitments disbursed and undisbursed standing above Sh8 trillion, there would be no further room for borrowing.“This means we are likely to take more than 90 per cent of the statutory ceiling of Sh9 trillion,” PBO said in an advisory to National Assembly’s Budget committee obtained by the Star.President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration has only Sh590 billion left to hit the Sh9 trillion debt ceiling approved by MPs in October 2019.The government is likely to lack legal space to fund up to Sh317 billion of next financial year’s budget owing to the current ceiling.PBO blamed the situation on serious credibility concerns of the National Treasury in fiscal management.It said the ceiling is likely to be breached by June 2021, setting the stage for a budget crisis in the financial year 2021-22.Among the concerns PBO raised with MPs was the government seeking T-bills redemption yet it has a huge overdraft of Sh51.2 billion against a ceiling of Sh68 billion.There are also legal issues surrounding the overdraft facility which is in form of borrowing and that the government still holds huge deposits of Sh320 billion.“Why not utilise the funds in the budget? Why hasn’t the government taken advantage of this?” PBO asked.It further argued that some loans are in dispute but commitment fees are still being paid. This has fiscal consequences in the future.Treasury suffered Sh186.3 billion revenue shortfall last fiscal year following the reliefs to cushion taxpayers from adverse effects of Covid-19.The revenue shortfall is anticipated to persist this year in the face of countries considering lockdowns and restrictions of movement to contain Covid-19.PBO further holds that the National Treasury is in breach of PFM law for not establishing a sinking fund.“This could help in the cash management of the debt portfolio. Ideally, the National Treasury should channel funds to sinking fund and then the Controller of Budget approval sought as and when required to pay out of the fund,” the team advised.At the moment, the National Treasury seeks direct authority from the Controller of the Budget without going through the sinking fund.“This ends up creating a mismatch between what is CoB approved and what is eventually paid out,” PBO said.The team is also advising against prior spending by the government saying it will hamper fiscal consolidation efforts and cause a crisis in budget financing.PBO argues that with revenue projected to underperform, there would be limited options for the Treasury to escape a higher ceiling.It cited a significant reduction of economic activity following the Covid-19 crisis dealing a blow to accommodation and food services; education; taxes on the product, transport, and warehousing.PBO holds that income tax revenue is expected to underperform due to subdued economic growth.Other aspects, the experts said, are job losses by workers in both the formal and informal sector due to the pandemic. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
499,Landowners block Ketraco contractor over payout dispute,"Landowners along the new Ol’Lessos-Kisumu electricity power line have protested against Ketraco's failure to compensate them for the wayleave.They said Ketraco wanted to construct the power line without valuing their properties among them commercial buildings and tea bushes.The power company is constructing a 400KV power line to increase power supply to Kisumu from the Ol’essos national grid power station under World Bank and EU credit facilities.The line has however been dogged by delays due to the controversy surrounding compensation and valuation of properties.Property owners within Ol’Lessos said Ketraco compensated people who have no land along the proposed line but was now arm-twisting those with genuine claims. They spoke during a confrontation with a Chinese contractor implementing the project on Monday.The farmers called for an audit of the project funds, saying the harassment being meted on them was a precursor of corruption.""We are not against government project, but we need our share of compensation. Ketraco has not approached us, yet the land is ours. Let them take the line to the people they paid,"" John Lagat said.Mzee Kurgat Agui said they never signed any agreement with Ketraco and have yet to meet for valuation be carried out. About 36 landowners at Kapkoros village within Ol’Lessos have had their properties marked for demolition. They said the state power firm compensated “ghost” landowners and asked EACC, DCI and the Presidential Delivery Unit to investigate the matter. Spokesperson Jonathan Bungei said under the Compulsory Acquisition Act, the land acquiring body has an obligation to value it agree with the owners on compensation. Senior officials of the power firm were not telling the government the right position of the problems at Ol’Lessos, Bungei said.Already, Ketraco has issued notices to landowners for the intended eviction to pave way for the construction of the line. The power-line was scheduled to be completed in 2017.“This is a freehold land; we have reasons to believe that something unlawful took place that’s why they want to evict people to cover up the fraud on the government money,” Bungei added.Ruth Mutai, 44, and Solomon Rono, 48, are among those whose houses Ketraco has earmarked for demolition.“We have nowhere to go. These are our houses and homes. How can a government agency displace us from our homes?” Mutai asked."
500,Schools warned against handpicking uniform suppliers,"The Competition Authority has put on notice public and private schools who have been recommending specific outlets for parents to buy school uniform from.In a notice to the public, the authority director general said on Monday that some schools specify in their admission letters, and school joining instructions where parents can purchase uniforms without any explicit benefit to the consumers.The director general has cautioned the school principals and administrators from the criticised conduct, saying parents are free to buy uniforms from their preferred outlets.“Parents should be free to buy uniforms from their preferred shops/outlets as long as school uniform bought meets the colour, shade, thread count and design as prescribed by the respective schools,” the CAK DG said. Members of the public affected by the conduct have been asked to contact the authority through [email protected].Section 7 of the authority’s Act, No. 12 of 2010 (The Act) enables the authority to enhance the welfare of Kenyans, promote and protect effective competition, and prevent misleading market conduct.Last year, leaders drawn from Makueni and Machakos counties urged the Ministry of Education to bar school principals from forcing students to buy uniform at the school to join Form 1.The leaders said the trend was deterring 100 per cent transition to secondary school.Uniform from the schools were more expensive with someone benefitting from the difference, parents noted."
501,"[PHOTOS] Kiambaa murders: Most passion exercised killing man, son - Autopsy","Nicholas Warunge, his wife, son, nephew and their construction worker were killed with clinical precision, their bodies bearing wounds that were similar in measurements and depth, an autopsy report has shown.The autopsy conducted on Monday showed that the stab wounds on the  bodies measured between three and four millimeters.State pathologist Johansen Oduor said the similarity of the wound patterns suggested that their killer was the same or “if they were different, then they used one murder weapon.”Warunge’s first born son Lawrence Simon Warunge confessed to the murders.The autopsy report showed the killer reserved the most intense anger for the father and son as their bodies bore the highest number of wounds.“The body of the elder male had the highest number of stab wounds as well as that of the son. Both of them had their heads severed from the body,” he said.“The wounds in the body of the father and the son suggest that the assailant may have been passionate or angry as he committed the crime,” Oduor added.It is the mother and the little brother who put up some form of defence during the attack, he explained. They both had broken hands also bearing stab wounds, suggesting they were lifting their hands to shield themselves from being hit by a blunt weapon and a sharp object.The bodies also had blunt trauma effect, suggesting they were also hit by blunt weapons., the results showed.Further, the autopsy results also showed that the body of the construction worker had blunt object trauma besides the stab wounds.“It appears the assailant found the victim unaware while he could have been asleep. He did not put up much fight in self defence,” the chief pathologist added.Lawrence, 23, was produced in a Kiambu court on Monday for a hearing of an application by the prosecutors to have him and his girlfriend detained for another 14 days.The court allowed the application to enable the detectives carry out conclusive investigation, including DNA testing and matching as well as mental assessment of the suspect.When the prosecution read the charges that it would press against him when he formally takes plea, the emotionless and calm the young man responded: ""no objection.""At the same time, Warunge's relatives have said they want Lawrence to ""rot in jail.""Dan Njeru, the brother of Warunge's wife told the Star the family hopes the  man is convicted ""as quickly as he committed the crimes and consigned to his rightful place in jail"".""I don't think it will take much to have him fixed. He is the one who led the investigators to Mai Mahiu and showed the murder weapons. I'm sure his DNA will match with those collected on the weapons and also correlated with the deadly wounds,"" he said.""That alone should have him placed at the center of the crime,"" he added.The fact that the suspect has voluntarily confessed to the crimes does not help his case, he added.The four family members will be buried on Saturday at their home where they were killed in Karura village in Kiambaa.Meanwhile, the family of Kinyanjui Wambaa, the construction worker also killed in the murders has plead  for help by well-wishers to foot mortuary bills.Wambaa, to be buried on Wednesday at Gathiga cemetery is a father of two and was 38 years old."
502,"Governors threaten legal action, shutdown over delayed county cash disbursements","The Council of Governors (COG) has threatened legal action to compel the National Treasury to release Sh94.7 billion meant for counties.In the letter to Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani, CoG chair Wycliffe Oparanya has also threatened shut down of county services to alleviate county employees who have not been paid for months from suffering.“Please note that if the disbursement is not made forthwith, the county governments will have no option other than seek legal redress while closing down to minimize further damage and suffering to employees,”  Oparanya lamented that counties have not received disbursements from the Treasury for four months, with some devolved units starved for five months now.“We note with utmost concern that County Governments have not received disbursements for October, November, December 2020 and January, 2021,” reads the letter dated January the letter, dated January.The Kakamega senator copied the letter to Controller of Budget (CoB) Margaret Nyakango, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and his senate counterpart Kenneth Lusaka.“Some of the Counties have not even received the September disbursement bringing the total balance to sh.94.7 Billion,” it adds.Oparanya reiterated that the delayed disbursement has hindered service delivery during the wake of Covid-19 pandemic; when the County Governments are the expected to be at the frontline in offering health services.In addition, County Government Civil Servants have not been paid salaries for the three months unlike their National Government counterparts who have been paid all their dues and statutory deductions made.Article 219 of the Constitution as read together with section 17(6) of the Public Finance Management Act provide for the timely disbursement of the equitable share of revenue.Notwithstanding the above, the Council notes that National Treasury has failed to disburse the same despite the stringent timelines set out in law.“The delay in disbursement of these funds has negatively affected lives of County Government Civil Servants and service delivery in the following aspects; failure of payment to contractors, and failure of development budget implementation and failure of submission of statutory deduction,” he said.This is so despite the fact that the Civil servants and Public Officers at National Government continue to receive their salaries in good time, Oparanya’s letter states.“The purpose of this letter is to ask your office to urgently expedite disbursement of equitable share to County Governments to ensure uninterrupted service delivery,” he held.This is not the first time the governors are threatening to shutdown services for delayed disbursement of cash by the Treasury.In September last year, the county bosses shutdown crucial services over prolonged delays to receive the cash.The Treasury has often blamed cash flow challenges to under collection of revenue by the taxman, a situation that has been worsened by the Covid 19 pandemic that has nearly hit all sectors of the economy."
503,Matiang’i reshuffles Kericho security teams in war on illicit brew,"Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has announced a reorganisation of security teams in Kericho county in the war on illicit brew.He said the move comes following the rise in the production, sale, and consumption of illicit brew in the area.The CS made the announcement in Kericho on Monday during a security tour.Bureti is among the sub-counties most affected by the illicit brew menace, buhowever other trouble areas are Kericho East and West, Sigowet, Kipkelion West and East.Matiang’i said some locals, including religious leaders had raised concerns regarding the involvement of some administrators and police in the running and/or protection of illegitimate businesses.He announced that the officers who, either through negligence or obstinacy, have been derelict in the performance of their duties will face disciplinary action.“Effective tomorrow, we will begin an operation to clean up areas of this county where consumption of illicit alcohol is high,” Matiang’i said.Matiang’i highlighted the impact of the enforcement gaps on illegal and unregulated gaming and gambling, which he said is fueling various social evils in the region.He added the government’s stance on cleaning up the sector has not changed and called upon Kenyans to support the government’s efforts in this endeavour.The CS directed the Department of Immigration Services to begin a progressive audit of all foreign investors in the county with a view to winnowing out those engaged in illegitimate activities.“If there are any foreigners who may be engaging in these illegal businesses, we will apprehend them and deport them – because that is what the law says.”Matiang’i was accompanied by the Energy CS Charles Keter, Trade CS Betty Maina, Vocational Training PS Alfred Cheruiyot, and Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya among other government officers."

510,"Avoid alcohol-based sanitisers, Education PS tells teachers","Schools have been encouraged to use soap and water more in handwashing, rather than sanitisers to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Education PS Belio Kipsang said this was to avoid abuse of the alcohol-based sanitisers. Kipsang said unlike use of soap and water, sanitisers can easily be abused because it is 70 per cent alcohol and is highly inflammable.He did not, however, discourage the school heads from purchasing the disinfectants.“We know the effects of this substance that is why we want to be more cautious about it,” he said.Speaking during his tour of schools in Bomet on Friday, the principal secretary urged learners to use face masks properly as required and wash hands regularly.“When we have our children strictly adhering to the laid down procedures by maintaining social distance and regularly washing hands there shall be no need of using the sanitisers anymore, we shall maintain their safety,” he stated.Kipsang visited Moi University campus in Bomet, St Mary’s Boarding, Kaplong Girls’, Tenwek and Mulot high schools.He also toured Jua Kali artisan shades at Boito and Mogogosiek in Konoin where the desks for schools are being made.The PS said at least 10, 000 learners have been affected since the resumption of learning across the country as a result of closure of private schools.He said while they are yet to complete statistics on what may have occasioned the closures, the number of pupils moving from one school to the other had risen.He, however, assured that learners set to sit the national examinations have not been interrupted in any way adding that the situation was not dire as has been thought of.He said the ministry will on Tuesday release a list of all private schools that closed."

The clip over the nose is also plastic,"" she said.This means that single use masks are emerging as new source of microplastic fibers.This means they can break down into small pieces of particles under 5 mm known as microplastics.The microplastics get into water ways, adding to the vast plastic and plastic particle waste in the environment.Kuchta's concerns is corroborated by other studies that have been carried out.A study titled 'Covid-19 face masks: A potential source of microplastic fibers in the environment', corroborates her views.The study, which was published in US National Library of Medicine June 16, 2020, was supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.""This new emergence of face masks as environmental litter both in the terrestrial and aquatic environment is a piece of evidence that the global pandemic has not in any way reduced the challenge of increasing plastic pollution in the environment,"" part of the study warns.""Disposable face masks (single use) that get to the environment (disposal in landfill, dumpsites, freshwater, oceans or littering at public spaces) could be emerging new source of microplastic fibers, as they can degrade/fragment or break down into smaller size/pieces of particles under 5 mm known as microplastics under environmental conditions.""Following the outbreak of the pandemic in the country March last year, the National Environment Management Authority developed guidelines for the management of waste.According to Nema guidelines, it is inappropriate to mix contaminated masks/gloves with household waste.However, some households are still mixing them due to the fact that municipal waste or garbage segregation is non -existent.Environment ministry has however drafted new National Sustainable Waste Management Bill, 2018, that aims at cutting down waste by 95 per cent. Under the new policy, which is at the National Assembly, waste will be segregated at source before service providers move them to materials recovery facilities where sorting, selling and treatment are done.Five per cent of the waste will be incinerated, 30 per cent recycled, while 60 per cent will be turned into manure. Only five per cent will go to landfills. The move will create jobs along the waste management chain. Currently, waste generated goes directly to the dumpsite, a move created massive dumpsite across the country. ""The mixture of contaminated waste and recyclable waste may cause a potential danger to waste collectors when they scavenge the waste bins to collect recyclable items. In worse case scenario, if someone just throws a used mask on the street, someone might pick it up, or worse try to collect them to sell as second-hand,"" Nema says in the guidelines.The authority says that for safety of others and themselves, the public have to take care of their used masks.It says disinfecting them will help ensure the used masks do not become a second source of the coronavirus infection.The guidelines emphasise the need to compel the public to ensure the used masks, and gloves are treated as contaminated items and must be disposed as infectious waste.Nema says special bins shall be set up in communities as centralised disposal points for the used masks and shall be supervised by the public health officers or their agents.""In gated community, apartments, residential areas, factories, institutions, office blocks, the management or the owner of such facilities will provide medical waste pedal bins that will have biohazard bin liners,"" it says.The authority says the management/owners will engage a licensed hazardous waste handler to collect and transport the infectious waste for a final disposal in accordance with Waste Management) Regulations of 2006.Nema says in the rural and small urban centres at the ward level, the county governments shall provide the same waste bins that will be placed either at the chiefs camps, ward offices, or health clinics and any other appropriate designated places that will be communicated to the public.""Collection of such hazardous waste from such designated places shall be done through a licensed infectious waste handler,"" Nema says.In public places including markets, bus/ matatu terminals, the county government shall provide to the general public Covid-19 related medical waste pedal receptacles that will have biohazard bin liners installed strategically in the public places and well secured and labelled infectious waste.Each County government will engage a NEMA Licensed infectious /biomedical waste handler as required by EMC (Waste Management) Regulations of 2006."
512,Mt Kenya leaders vow to aggressively lobby for BBI,"MPs from the Mt Kenya region have vowed to aggressively lobby for the Constitution of Kenya Amendment Bill in the region.The leaders, who met in a hotel in Murang’a County on Saturday, said they will immediately embark on civic education and active mobilisation.In a statement read by Kirinyaga Senator Charles Kibiru, the leaders lauded locals for demonstrating their support for the region by appending their signatures in support of the bill and endorsing the proposed political reforms enshrined in the document.They noted that only 15 elected Members of Parliament out of 91 are against the BBI report and that the remaining 60 continue to steer the country to a progressive path being charted by the President.“Let it be noted that we have gathered here as the silent majority of leaders in the region in contrast to the few who dominate the headlines,” they said.They said as leaders from a community that has always borne the brunt of political violence, they understand the value of peace and stability that were not evident before the handshake between the President and ODM leader Raila Odinga.They said BBI is the only way for the Mt. Kenya region to realise the promises of democracy, fairness, equity and equality of all citizens that are enshrined in the constitution.It will also best the route to lasting peace and the region’s political and economic future. The BBI will strengthen the fight against graft by limiting the amount of time corruption and other economic crimes take in court.“There has been a massive disinformation campaign and deliberate efforts to delegitimise the BBI process in the region and make it appear unpopular by elements that do not have our interests at heart,” they further noted.“We are compelled to remind our people that failure to pass the document would portend a bleak future for the region as it would result in the continuation of an unjust status quo and also aggravate economic and development deprivation in the region,” they said.The MPs said they are counting on the pragmatism of the locals to help them rally behind what advances their interests noting that there are some political leaders out to neutralise the unity of the region.They extended an olive branch to those yet to support the BBI who they said ‘keep telling us that BBI is good but they are afraid to antagonise their masters’.On Thursday, the council of eminent persons of Murang’a summoned senator Irungu Kang'ata over his letter to the President on BBI seeking to establish the authenticity of the letter.Chairman Joe Kibe confirmed that they met the senator but declined to divulge more information.The letter that hit the headlines early last week has drawn strong support from leaders affiliated to the Deputy President and admonishment from those lobbying for the BBI.On Saturday, the President addressed Kang’ata saying he believes in democracy but added that he is in charge of the government and its operations.“I do not need to be lectured. I know where I am and am very clear of where I am going,” he said."
513,"If Biden got elected, I too can be Kitui Governor - David Musila","Veteran politician David Musila will seek to unseat Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu in the 2022 polls.Musila lost to Ngilu for the same position in 2017.Musila said on Saturday he has sought divine intervention to beat the governor. He called on religious leaders to earnestly pray for him in his journey to dethrone Ngilu.Musila and former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe lost to Ngilu during the last general election, when she garnered 162,768 votes while Musila got 108,635 with Malombe trailing with about 73,000 votes.He spoke at the funeral service for the late Migwani Sub County Crop Officer Patrice Mung'eli, at Kea Primary School in Mwingi West, Kitui County.“I am asking for collective prayers from men of God so that God with help me dethrone this woman for our people to get better service,” Musila told the mourners. He asked the mourners if they supported his quest to send Ngilu home to which they roared back in the affirmative.“I am telling you that I have always executed all my duties through God’s graceful empowerment. It is only God who will help us. I am asking the men of God to pray for me,” said Musila. He lashed out at Governor Ngilu and others who claimed that he was too old to become governor.“Americans elected (Joe) Biden who at 79 years is my senior by four years their president the other day. Those claiming that I am 90 years old are mistaken; did they give birth to me?  They should come for my birth certificate too ascertain my age,” said the former Kitui senator.Biden is 78 years, he was born on November 20, 1942. “I am in the race in response to Kitui peoples’ incessant pressure to seek to become governor so that I can bail them out of the myriad problems dogging them in health sector as well as water scarcity and other under current administration,” said Musila.Besides Musila, others who have expresed interest in the Kitui governorship in 2022 polls are Malombe,  former Nairobi deputy governor Jonathan Mueke and Kenya's high commissioner to Uganda Kiema Kilonzo."
514,Baringo residents defaecate in basins for fear of elephants,"Residents of Kerio Valley are defaecating in basins at night for fear of being attacked by stray elephants should they dare walk to their latrines.More than 30 elephants have escaped from the Rimoi and Lake Kamnarok game reserves located at the border of Baringo and Elgeyo-Marakwet counties.“Our families, including men, no longer come out to use the toilets at night. Instead, people prefer using basins for fear for their lives,” Dorothy Kiprotich said on Thursday. She is a resident of Ayatya village.She said the jumbos are so wild and “they can easily attack and kill.” The residents said the animals have camped in the area since December. They said they have reported to Kenya Wildlife Service but the agency is yet to take action.In 2019, an elephant attacked and killed primary school teacher Jackson Chepyegon at Sessunin village in Barwessa ward.The residents said the memories still linger and that they can't take chances with their lives.Kiprotich said they have stopped their children from going to school in the morning. Learners are only allowed to leave home after 10am when the animals will have disappeared to the nearby bushes.Farmer David Chepkong’a said the jumbos have caused massive destruction in farms. More than 200 households have been affected.“They have cut down my barbed wire fence, eaten and destroyed my banana, mangoes and peas. They have also eaten the pasture I had preserved for my cattle,” Chepkong’a said.Farmers Stephen Chelal, Collins Masaria, Andrew Paliat, Paul Chesang and Joseph Makilap said they had suffered similar losses.The affected villages include Cheptargok, Koitum, Chemale Chesawany, Chepkorony, Koiser, Seron and Ayatya in Barwessa ward, Baringo North constituency.Residents said elephant invasion has been a recurrent problem and asked the government to provide a lasting solution or they kill the beasts.Baringo county senior KWS warden Peter Lekeren said they had already deployed officers to drive away the stray elephants.He attributed the upsurge of human-wildlife conflict along the Kerio Valley to encroachment onto the protected Kamnarok Game Reserve.“Due to scarce water this dry season, it has forced the elephants to break and walk kilometers away to the seasonal water points near people's homesteads,” Lekeren said.He said only fencing off the game reserve would provide a lasting solution.""We fully support that as KWS,"" Lewkeren said.The warden warned locals against taking the law into their hands to harass or threaten to kill the animals saying they are so fierce and dangerous.He urged the residents to make reports in good time to KWS and also follow the right procedures for compensation in case of attacks, death, injures or losses due invasion into farms.Edited by P.O"
515,Japanese Foreign Affairs minister concludes African tour in Kenya,"Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu will on Tuesday arrive in Kenya for a two-day visit to bolster the countries' relations.The visit will mark the end of Motegi's tour of Africa that began last month.In a press statement, the Japanese embassy on Friday said the visit aims at enhancing diplomatic ties and cooperation of the two countries.The countries will discuss Japan’s key foreign strategy — Free and Open Indo-Pacific, the Tokyo International Conference of African Development 8 — and mutual global interests. TICAD 8 will be held in Tunisia next year. Kenya is now a UNSC non-permanent member for 2021-22 period. TICAD was launched in 1993 by Japan to promote Africa's development, peace and security through the strengthening of multilateral cooperation and partnerships.The Foreign Minister has so far visited six African countries in two months and will arrive in Nairobi from Dakar.  “This will be my second visit to Africa as a Japanese Foreign Minister since the global spread of the novel coronavirus. Together with strengthening bilateral relations with all of the countries and confirming cooperation on the Free and Open Indo-Pacific, I will promote diplomacy with both tolerance and strength,” Motegi said when he announced his Africa visit in January.In his first visit in December last year, he toured Tunisia, Mozambique, South Africa and Mauritius.He said he would promote cooperation with the various countries regarding development towards TICAD 8, business relations and regional peace and stability based on the results of his first visit to Africa.Upon arrival on Tuesday, Minister Motegi is expected to hold talks with his Kenyan counterpart Raychelle Omamo on Wednesday morning. He will later proceed to State House, Nairobi, for talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta.In the afternoon, the minister will meet Sports and Culture CS Amina Mohamed before departing that evening. While the meeting will centre on Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Amina is highly regarded by the Japanese government. She was honoured by Emperor Akihito in 2017 with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, the highest honour conferred on foreign nationals.Japan and Kenya have enjoyed close ties, especially during the tenure of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.For instance, Kenya secured financial support for key infrastructure projects from Japan including several roads such as Ngong Road, renewable energy projects, water and the ongoing Special Economic Zone in Dongo Kundu in Mombasa county, among other developments.CHINA-JAPAN RIVALRY? Motegi’s visit to Africa coincides with that of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's. Wang wrapped up his five-nation diplomatic tour of Africa with a one-day visit to Seychelles on January 9.Minister Wang started his visit in Africa on Monday, shuttling through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Botswana, Tanzania and Seychelles.Since 1991, Chinese foreign ministers have chosen Africa for their first overseas visit.""China and Africa's friendship had withstood the pandemic and risen to a new height in 2020. The Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity against Covid-19 jointly held by President Xi Jinping and the African leaders (in June) has set the example for global anti-epidemic cooperation. 2020 marked the 20th anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, "" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in an earlier statement.Top on China's agenda in Africa are economic recovery, co-building the Belt and Road Initiative and joint efforts in fighting Covid-19."
516,Accident victims overwhelm Naivasha hopsital,"The Naivasha sub-county hospital is overwhelmed by a steadily rising number of accident victims. Majority are motorcycle operators and pedestrians.The hospital superintendent Dr Angeline Ithondeka said services at the trauma and emergency centre in the facility were stretched to the limit.She noted that the hospital, which serves over 600 patients daily, was serving victims of accidents along the Nairobi-Nakuru and the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu roads.“We have seen an increase in the number of accidents involving pedestrians and motorcycles mainly around December after the government relaxed the travel regulations,” she said.She spoke when Stima Sacco handed over the female ward, renovated at Sh400,000, to the hospital management.While thanking Stima Sacco, Ithondeka added that they were working with other stakeholders including traffic police to train the motorcycle operators on road safety so as to reduce the accidents.The CEO of the Sacco, Dr Gamaliel Hassan, said they were keen to support the hospital due to the high number of patients and accident victims who benefitted from it.Hassan noted that due to its location, the hospital was suited to serve tens of accident victims and hence the need to expand its trauma centre and equip it.“We are planning to use Sh1 million every year on this hospital, which serves the community and comes to the rescue of tens of accident victims,” he said.The hospital chairman, Dr Simon Kanyingi, said that works on a new HDU and ICU were at an advanced stage.He noted that the hospital served the nearby counties of Nyandarua, Kiambu, Kajiado, and the two highways, hence the need to increase its bed capacity.“We are seeking donors to support in the construction of an oxygen plan and to acquire an incinerator as part of improving our services,” he said.Viwandani MCA Eric Gichuki added that the Sh300 million outpatient wing under construction by Kengen would be complete by April.“The ultra modern wing is 80 per cent done and once complete it will greatly improve health services in this region,” he said."
517,Uhuru inspects Jomo Kenyatta Stadium in Kisumu,"President Uhuru on Sunday inspected construction of Sh1.4 billion Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Kisumu, to be launched in mid-April.The President had spent the night at the Kisumu State Lodge after attending the funeral of ANC leader  Musalia Mudavadi's mother.He met ODM Leader Raila Odinga and Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o before proceeding to the grounds.He arrived at Mamboleo accompanied by three Air Force choppers, one of them carrying Raila.Both the President and Raila were impressed with the works done within two months, saying the stadium will be launched in April.The 30,000-capacity stadium will have facilities for football, rugby, tennis, hockey among other sports.The President is expected to launch the Jomo Kenyatta Stadium alongside the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Sports Complex within the town, Kisumu port, Uhuru Business Complex, Marine School and a passenger railways terminus within the city.The construction of the railways is to begin soon after the Railways Cooperation on Friday demolished illegal structures on the railway line at Obunga in Kisumu.The demolition will pave the way for the ongoing Sh3.8 billion rehabilitation of the 217km Nakuru-Kisumu tracks.The President was last in the lakeside city in October where he inspected the various development projects and launched the construction of the stadium.The stadium was supposed to be constructed within the city centre, but there was not enough space.In December, Raila visited the site where he called for structural adjustments. He said he would ask President Uhuru for additional funding.Raila said the project was relocated from the centre of the city which was not spacious enough to accommodate many people for a major sporting event. He said it was one of many projects across the country.  He said the projects will provide employment opportunities to the youths and not tokenism, which is not an answer to unemployment.The ODM boss said the country needs sports groups to cultivate talent.He deplored the low representation of Kenyan professional players in other global leagues, saying Kenyan talent is untapped.Earlier, President Uhuru directed Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to ensure that the 63km Kisumu-Mamboleo-Chemelil road was done before the stadium is opened.""We are constructing an international stadium here in Mamboleo and this type of road should not be leading to such a stadium,"" he said.""I will be coming here in April next year and this should be completed by then.""Four months ago, the government approved Sh4.9 billion for the construction of the road after two decades of neglect.The road links Kisumu to neighbouring counties.Leaders and residents have for more than 20 years been demanding that the road be repaired.The road is filled with potholes and motorists have been incurring losses in repairing their damaged vehicles.(Edited by V.

519,"Keep off our election, Knut tells TSC","Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) has asked the government not to interfere with its upcoming national election.Members who spoke in Bomet on Saturday told the government to allow the union conduct its poll freely without interference of any sort.Union’s assistant secretary general Clement Gitau said they are aware of the government’s plan to kill the union as evidenced by the withholding of register of its members and failing to failing to deduct and remit dues from members to the union.Gitau said the war the union has with TSC was an indicator of 'ill plans' the government has against them but noted such should not be allowed to spill into the election.“We are asking the government to allow teachers to exercise their rights and elect their preferred officials to head the union…we do not want to see some individuals being imposed on them,” he said.The union at the weekend continued to defy odds and conduct elections across its branches in the country.A total of 16 branches from Rift Valley, Nyanza and Eastern held the election on Friday and Saturday. The elections are held ahead of the upcoming national poll set for March this year.There have been rumors that the election might not be held due to lack of funds.Union officials who attended the Bomet branch election on Saturday disclosed that they had to reach out to sponsors and well-wishers to conduct the election while in some areas teachers conducted fundraising to support the exercise.But, giving a clearest indication that not even the financial crisis will weaken the union, members from across the country converged at various branches and elected new office holders.Bomet branch executive secretary Malel Langat, who was reelected to the seat, maintained they will not allow the union to die.“If we fail to conduct the election as required by our constitution we shall have broken the law and that means we have allowed union to die that is why we have maintained that whether we have money or not we are going to conduct the poll in all our branches,” said Malel.Malel trounced his close rival Desmond Langat after garnering 391 votes against 147."

521,"Find missing children, Matiang'i tells chiefs","Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has said the government will support schools in ensuring smooth operations during the pandemic.The CS spoke on Saturday at Nyambaria School in Nyamira County where he assessed the learning process at the institution.He was with Health PS Susan Mochache, Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose, Woman representative Jerusha Momanyi, Principal Boaz Owino and county commissioner Amos Mariba.“The government is willing to ensure learning is smooth even after some days of interruptions over this corona virus disease. We are calling upon all the stakeholders to come in and help our institutions so that or children are not affected in any way,” Matiang’i said.Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose said they will help in enhancing better infrastructure in schools by using the NG CDF kitty in promoting infrastructural development so that students can have a good learning environment.“We are ready to assist in developing our learning institutions so that learners can have humble time for their studies and that we promise as leaders and we must fulfill,” said Mose.Matiang’i noted that some school heads are sending children home for school fees saying the government has already taken care of the same and the only remaining part is the learners to be in school.“No parent should have a child at home over school fees, let the children be at school first and the government will take care of the rest,” he said.Matiang’i also directed security officials to ensure every child is in school by looking for those who have not reported back, establish reasons why they have not reported back and have them back to school.“It is not a matter of debate that we need children in school. All the children must be in school because the government requires them to be in school.

522,"Governors, state meet Monday to expedite deal with nurses","National and county government representatives will meet Monday to hasten the signing of a deal to reimburse nurses medical expense bills and granting them a minimum Sh15,000 in allowances. The return-to-work formula agreed with striking nurses also provides for compensation of dependants of those who die from Covid-19 while on duty. To date, 34 nurses have died while serving coronavirus patients. The nurses’ strike commenced on December 7 and enters its 35th day today. Should the agreement be signed, all striking nurses will be back to work within 24 hours.The two levels of government and the union had reached consensus on the items contained in the draft agreement but the Council of Governors has yet to sign it. The CoG says it was not consulted.The consultations were completed last week but the document has been lying at the Labour ministry pending the signatures. A multi-agency standing committee at the ministry led the negotiations. Kenya National Union of Nurses' secretary-general Seth Panyako has asked all striking nurses to stay put until the agreement is signed by all parties.Panyako said the two levels of government agreed on all items as contained in the draft agreement.“This view that is held by the CoG we want to say it is incorrect. During the negotiations, the secretariat of the CoG was always present and we believe that they came there with all the authorities and the mandate to represent the CoG so they can't come around again and say they were not involved,” Panyako said.He said they have information that consultation by phone and video conferences did happen between the national government and CoG.“It is, therefore, not right for the CoG to try to run away from the process they know and a process which they are not being asked to generate any income,” he added.Nurses have been on strike to push for among other issues a risk allowance, adequate personal protective equipment, comprehensive medical insurance cover and delayed salaries.In the return-to-work deal, the employer also agreed to provide adequate and quality personal protective equipment to all nurses and release of all withheld salaries arising from the strikeAll nurses employed on contracts, including on UHC shall be paid salary and allowances in accordance with the law. It was also agreed that the national government releases the stipend for BSC intern nurses within two weeks.“The negotiations are over. The consultations which are going on is between government and government. It is not between the union and the government. Once they agree we will go sign the RTWF and ask our people to go back to work,” Panyako said.In addition, it was agreed that no member will be victimised or be subjected to arbitrary redeployments. All show-cause, suspension and dismissal letters issued during the strike period will be withdrawn. Acting KNUN national chairman Joseph Ngwasi said they had done their part and the government should fulfil their end of the bargain.  “Until now the government is still dragging and pushing so it is clear that we the nurses have been neglected by the government and we are not taken with the seriousness that we deserve,” Ngwasi said. Parties also agreed to follow laid down dispute resolution mechanisms in dealing with future disputes.The union has accused the governors of taking over the functions of the County Public Service Boards.

523,"Search for 450,000 missing learners begins","The government has begun the search for learners who are yet to report back to school a week after reopening.The country has 15 million learners and the Education ministry last week announced that at least 97 per cent of them have reported back to school.This means the number of those yet to report back is about 450,000.The said causes of absenteeism are flooding in various parts of the Rift Valley, early pregnancies and marriages, and child labour among others.The search for the missing learners will be spearheaded by administrative officers; chiefs and assistant chiefs.On Saturday, Basic Education PS Belio Kipsang said the ministry is taking stock of every learner who was in school prior to the closure of schools in March last year.They will also seek to establish the number of girls who might have conceived during the period.Other details to be sought will be their respective schools, classes, and level of pregnancy to help them to resume learning with minimal challenges.Kipsang said this after visiting St. Mary’s Complex Boarding Primary Schools, Kaplong Girls High School, Tenwek Boys High School and Korara Secondary School in Bomet County.The PS said the government not only wants 100 per cent enrollment in primary school but full transition to secondary school.School infrastructureKipsang said the Ministry of Education had reserved about Sh30 billion towards development of infrastructure in public primary and secondary schools.He said the ministry had allocated Sh2.4 billion towards infrastructure for secondary schools and Sh240 million towards primary schools.“Low cost boarding primary schools in Asal areas have been allocated Sh300 million,” Kipsang added, saying the government has reserved Sh15 billion from the Free Day Secondary Education kitty for school improvement and maintenance, all of which go into infrastructure development.The PS said additional cumulative sum of Sh2 bilion is hived off from the fees parents in boarding schools pay towards school infrastructure.Kipsang said that Sh8.2 billion has been set aside for school infrastructure in 110 educationally and economically disadvantaged sub-counties in 30 counties.The funds are part of Sh20 billion that the government in conjunction with the World Bank earmarked to finance the improvement of retention of learners in primary education as well as transition to Secondary education in poor areas of the country.School infrastructure includes classrooms, laboratories for science practicals, dormitories, sanitation facilities, and halls among others.Kipsang said the government spent this money on construction of classrooms alone, to the exclusion of other infrastructural needs."
524,"Don’t send learners home for school fees, Nanok warns","Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok has warned school heads not to send learners home for lack of school fees.Governor Nanok decried that schools heads in Turkana have disobeyed the order from the Ministry of Education that requires students to be in schools.Governor Nanok spoke during the launch of youth and women fund over the weekend at Lodwar town.“I’m told many learners have been sent home for school fees. When schools reopened we all heard a warning the Cabinet Secretary of Education George Magoha that no student is supposed to be send home for lack of school fees. What is happening in Turkana? School heads don’t have ears? Learners are being send home for fees and we are wondering who holds a big position between the CS Magoha and school heads?” he posed.Last week, Turkana schools experienced low turnout of learners and schools were tasked to work closely with chiefs and other stakeholders to bring learners back, including pregnant girls.“There is a slow return of learners in Turkana. We are working with all stakeholders to ensure each child gets back to school, including victims of early pregnancies,” Education CAS Mumina Bunayo said last week while she was touring schools to assess their preparedness for reopening.The CAS said the national government will provide sanitisers for water-scarce schools so students can wash their hands and curb the spread of Covid-19.The reopening of schools has faced challenges of water shortage, lack of face masks and an acute shortage of classrooms to enable learners adhere to social distancing.“We understand not all schools have running water, but the ministry has tried our best to put washing points in schools where there is water shortage,"" Bunayo said.""And we will provide sanitiser where water is scarce; it will be under the control of teachers,"" she said.Bunayo also said government will provide face masks for children whose families cannot afford them."
525,Jubilee picks candidate for Naivasha seat,"The ruling Jubilee Party has settled for Virgnia Wamaitha as its candidate for the coming Hells Gate Ward by-election in Naivasha, following its Sunday nominations.The former nominated MCA beat three other candidates for the nominations that were marred by poor turn-out, with 1,633 of the over 24,000 registered voters in the ward turning up for the exercise.The seat fell vacant in November last year following the death of area MCA John Njuguna Wassusy following a short illness.Earlier, officials of the Jubilee party bowed to public pressure and agreed to hold nominations for the vacant seat.This is after the party lost the Lakeview ward seat in Naivasha in the by-elections held in December after imposing a candidate on the electorate.In the Hells Gate nominations, Wamaitha garnered 560 votes followed closely by Kiguru Kimani (480) while Felister Cheptum, the wife of the late MCA, got 194 votes.Wamaitha will battle it out with over five other aspirants in the by-election slated for March 4, with UDA candidate and former area MCA Jonathan Warothe among the top-contenders.While thanking the electorate, Wamaitha said the party was keen to rediscover its lost glory in the coming by-election.She said the real campaign had kicked off, adding that she was ready to face-off with other candidates for the vast ward.“I thank all who turned up despite the low numbers and its time that we supported the ruling party so that it can regain this seat,” she said.Speaking earlier, Naivasha MP Jane Kihara said that Jubilee party was tainted and no one wanted to be associated with it following the controversial by-elections in Lakeview.“We have for years supported Jubilee but we were kicked out unceremoniously and our positions handed over to ODM and the Lakeview loss was a major win for us,” she said.Kihara, who celebrated the party’s loss, termed Jubilee as a ‘dead-party’ led by dictators who would not reason or listen to other leaders.“Very few people want to be associated with Jubilee as voters in Hellsgate ward head to the by elections and this says a lot about the crumbling party,” she said."
526,KNUT treasurer Matiang'i slams TSC for curtailing freedom of worship,"Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) National treasurer John Matiang’i has slammed the teachers’ employer for curtailing freedom of worship.Matiang’i, who spoke at Gusii Stadium on Sunday when he presided over branch elections noted, that the Teachers Service Commission’s move to ban teachers from attending trainings, elections and other activities on weekdays is illegal.He petitioned the clergy and MPs to speak out against the move saying it was unconstitutional.“Church leaders and politicians should not be mute leaving their members at the mercy of employees busy in defying the Constitution,” he noted.“Teachers are denied an opportunity to worship on their preferred days because they must attend trainings on weekends. Like now, we have been forced to do elections on Saturday and Sunday when we are supposed to be in church. We cannot accept to work on weekends,” Matiang’i said.He added: “TSC has now become a rogue commission that is implementing illegal policies and intimidating teachers. We are warning the commission that teachers will reject any form of intimidation.”He said actions by TSC were affecting the morale of teachers.“Teachers are low in morale and feel threatened. Warning letters are becoming the norm of the day. You can take a cow to the river but you can’t force it into drinking water,” he further added.Matiang’i further warned that TSC was out to kill the giant union.“We had more than 100,000 members but the numbers have gone down due to intimidation by our employer. KNUT will not die and I want to ask President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene,” he told jubilant members.Last week, ODM party leader Raila Odinga asked the Teachers Service Commission and the teacher’s umbrella Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) to find the solution to their stalemate.“As of today, membership of Knut has shrunk from a high of 187,000 to 23,000. Its income has dwindled from Sh144 million to Sh15 million against a salary portfolio of Sh80 million for over 600 workers spread across the country,” Raila said.He said that teachers are not happy with the current threats from their employer, who is about to bring to its knees the movement built from the scratch since 1957.Siaya Senator James Orengo also weighed in on the issue and warned against efforts to kill the KNUT.Speaking in Vihiga during the burial of Mama Hannah Mudavadi said, “We fought for TSC to defend and fight for teachers. The TSC is killing KNUT instead of defending it. Mr President save the teachers from TSC.”"

528,Retract statement over tribal leadership - Murkomen urges Uhuru,"Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen now wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to withdraw his statement over communities in leadership in the country.The president on Saturday signalled that maybe the time has come for other communities to lead the nation.Uhuru said that Kenya has been led by only two communities since independence and that it might be the time for other communities that have not tasted leadership to take over.""Ata mimi naweza simama hapa na niseme kuna jamii tu mbili za Kenya ambazo zimetawala. Labda ni nafasi ya jamii nyengine pia kutawala. Jamii za Kenya ni mingi,"" Uhuru said.During a Church service on Sunday at House of Hope Church, Kayole, Murkomen said Uhuru should take back his comments during his next presidential State of the Nation address.The former Majority leader claimed the president is being wrongfully advised and his sentiments could leave people feeling sidelined.""In the next State of the Nation address, I want to request the president to correct the things he said yesterday in Vihiga and restate the true position of the country where we will organize ourselves not based on tribes but as a united country,""Murkomen said.""There is no other president who has ever said something like that in this Republic since 1963. Any statement by the president is a national policy.""He needs to correct that position so that our country can come back to that sense. Otherwise, in part of the country, people will be feeling disenfranchised,"" Murkomen added."
529,Why Igathe’s way of resignation is a non-issue to IEBC,"As the race to find Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s successor intensify’s, queries have been raised regarding the resignation of Polycarp Igathe as the Deputy Governor back in 2018.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) said it had no obligation to gazette the exit of former Nairobi Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe.On January 12, 2018, Igathe announced his surprising resignation via Twitter on grounds that he failed to earn the trust of Sonko to enable him to work at the County.“Dear Nairobians, it is with a heavy heart that I resign my seat as elected Deputy Governor of Nairobi City County effective 1 pm on 31st Jan 2018...I regret I have failed to earn the trust of the Governor to enable me to drive Admin & Management of the county. Without fear, favour or ill will I step down to avoid abusing or betraying my oath of office to Kenyans, Nairobians and my family. Thank you for the encouraging support given to me so far,” he said.Igathe tendered his resignation in a letter that was addressed to Sonko and copied to former County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi who confirmed to have received the letter the following day.Since then the county has never had a Deputy Governor and the former county boss enjoyed his reign, running county affairs as a one-man show.In December 2019, Sonko was barred from office after being charged with misappropriation of Sh357 million.In a letter dated December 18, 2020, Elachi and the clerk had written to IEBC through Lawyer John Diro seeking advice on governance following Sonko’s arrest.IEBC while responding to the letter said it had never received a formal communication regarding Igathe's resignation.""On the vacancy in the office of the Deputy Governor, Nairobi County, the commission has not received any formal communication as to the alleged vacancy other than the information in the media,” reads the letter from IEBC.The letter was dated January 9, 2020, and signed by IEBC director of legal and public affairs Michael Goa, who responded on behalf of Acting IEBC Chief Executive Officer Marjan Hussein.However, a day later IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati in a letter clarified that if Igathe exited for whatever reason, the commission had no obligation to gazette his exit.""The commission has no legal obligation to gazette the resignation of an outgoing holder of elective office, but rather it has an obligation to gazette a new holder of an elective office,” he said.The Chairman said Igathe's exit became apparent on January 22, 2020, after former Nairobi Governor Sonko communicated to them on naming a nominee.Chebukati highlighted that he received a letter from Sonko nominating a deputy governor indicating there was a vacancy, in compliance with Article 180 (5) of the Constitution 2010."
530,Open letter to Nairobi governor by-election candidates,"The Nairobi by-election may be delayed – pending court decisions. Maybe it won’t happen at all. If it does: these questions would be relevant.Dear candidates, you are asking us, the voters of Nairobi, to turn out to vote for you despite the risks associated with crowded places because of the virus. Some of us may feel reluctant to run the risk. Your answers may help us decide.Why do you want to be Governor?This is a bit of a puzzle. If you win you will get to serve for fewer than 18 months. Why bother?If you want the basis for this statement, please go to Article 182(6) of the Constitution. Anyone who assumes the office of governor under Article 182 holds office until the newly elected Governor takes over following the next election under Article 180(1).The election for which you are now standing or proposing to stand does come under Article 182 (clause 5). And the election under Article 180(1) is to be on the second Tuesday in August, in 2022, same as for MPs.What is more, it seems that since, if you win, you would be assuming the office of Governor, albeit for a short time, that would count as the first of your two maximum terms as governor. The only exception to this rule is for a Deputy Governor who takes over when a governor dies or is removed.To Ferdinand Waititu: At this point we can pass over the issue of whether you are disqualified from standing. It will very likely be resolved in court.Even if that issue does not debar you, another interesting question would arise: You assumed office as governor in Kiambu in 2017 and thus are deemed to have (it means treated as having) served a full term (Article 180(8)).You can only hold office 'as a county governor' for two terms. Does this mean any county governor, or governor for a particular county? The courts may have to decide. One asks you again – Why do you want it?To return to all the candidates.Will you be a complete governor or a hamstrung one?Another reason for wondering why anyone wants to be governor of our county is Article 187, Major General Mohammed Badi and the national government have taken over many of the county’s important functions.The Office of the President said that the functions taken over are health, transport public works, utilities and auxiliary services and planning and development.Interestingly, the media have suggested that the reason the BBI final Bill says nothing about Nairobi is that the current national leadership does not feel strongly about the general issue; it’s just about Mike Sonko and his incapacities.We voters would like to know first what is your considered opinion about this takeover? Is it valid? Is it your intention to reverse this action?Do you have the power to do so? Do you have some understanding of how the current national government would respond if you asked for your powers back? Could you do it by August 2022?What do you make of Article 187(2)(b)? This says that even if powers are transferred “constitutional responsibility for the performance of the function or exercise of the power shall remain with the government to which it is assigned by the Fourth Schedule.""Can you please tell us what powers of real importance to Nairobians you would retain if the takeover remains?And if it does remain, what shall we be paying you for?TRUNCATED POWERSLet’s first consider powers that currently remain county functions. Agriculture is one.Are you aware of the steps that Nairobi county has taken to encourage urban agriculture? What should be done – what would you do – to implement these measures and strengthen them?What is the state of pre-primary education in Nairobi? If you don’t know, what would you plan to do to find out? What is your vision of a good pre-primary education system for the city?How about pollution in Nairobi? Pollution remains a county function. Do you know the figures for the extent of air pollution?What would you propose to do to improve it? And, by the way, if a significant source is commercial vehicles, including buses, how will you deal with it if you don’t have control over county transport?Can you explain why there are places in this city – even in the CDB - where rubbish sits in rotting and smelling heaps? And why for some places there is simply no service to dispose of rubbish? And what is your plan?What is the scope for improving local tourism in the city? How would you go about it?If you are able to take back powers from the Major General, what is your plan for health services in the city? What do you know about how the facilities have been – or not been – able to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic? What does this mean for the future of health services in Nairobi?You must be aware that at least half (some say 60 per cent) of the people of Nairobi live in informal settlements. These occupy, however, only about five per cent of the land in the city. One of the most important questions must be, how will you make their lives better?How will you do so if the Major General is still responsible for water (it falls under public works), health services, refuse (it comes under health services), local roads (they come under county transport) and housing (comes under county planning and development)? Can you do anything to curb police excesses? Be honest – what use can you be?And, if you have full powers – how will you use them to benefit those 60 per cent?HOW ABOUT THE MONEY?Though Nairobi does better than other counties in local revenue collection, it does not manage to collect what it plans. Last financial year it fell 55 per cent below target. And you would come into office, if elected, a year after the disastrous pandemic began.What is your strategy for improving county revenue? Indeed, how will you help Nairobi and Nairobians recover generally from the impacts of this last year?First about you: Tell how you satisfy Chapter Six on Integrity. By the way, can you please analyse the shortcomings of the previous governor, and how you intend to be different?More than four million people live here. Nairobi contributes 22 per cent of our GDP, though its economic growth rate is only average.What is your vision? How will you make Nairobi a beautiful, dynamic, smoothly functioning and just city, worthy to be our nations’ capital? And how does that vision (if you have one) connect to that for the lives of ordinary Nairobians?GIVE US BENCHMARKSMany bodies (other than politicians) are required to produce strategic plans. They include not only their visions and their objectives but timelines and benchmarks.By such and such a date they will have achieved certain stages in their plans. They have to identify indicators – measures that enable us to see whether they are going in the right direction.So tell us, please, what you intend to achieve by, say, the end of the financial year 2021-22? How will you know whether you have achieved anything? And how shall we know?Or is it that you are planning on having a honeymoon period in which a lot of talk, and maybe some new broom action, will endear us to you, and which will last for 15 months, so we shall re-elect you?This is our city and we care about it and the lives of the people who live here. Do you? Do you even live here?A final question: would you dream of participating in an election that defies court orders?If you were being interviewed for this job, and could not answer these questions satisfactorily, we would not appoint you. Why should we vote for you if you cannot?"
531,Kenyans must reject populist conmanship,"Populism is the belief in the power of ordinary people to have control over their government as a right and not having a small group of political insiders or a 'wealthy elite' hog the power.The existence or rise of populism is not a partisan issue, but it is can spring up on either side of the political divide.Regardless of whether it springs up from the right or left, a common denominator in all populist insurgencies is having a leader who holds himself out '.Another common denominator is that these “common people” feel and loudly proclaim that they have been alienated, disenfranchised, and forgotten by other politicians.The reasons given for their struggles are “political elite” tipping the scales in their favour at the expense of these common people and through political schemes, while ignoring the constituents they were elected to represent.Populism comes in different flavours, with the most common being where the leader of the populist movement (and there is always one who emerges from among a pack) pits the 'common man and woman'” against the despised elite.In Kenya, a common reference to this common man or woman is 'Wanjiku,', though Moraa or Akinyi can do fine as an alternate reference.Populism is nothing new or recent in politics as it has its historical origins going back to the early 19th Century.However, scholars agree modern populism is a different breed from its earlier version. The modern version is more widespread owing largely to technological advancement in social media that reaches far and wide.Much of the transformation of European politics in the 1990s happened largely as result of spontaneous grassroots political movements.The Arab Spring that transformed — or at least tried to transform much of the Arab world in the 2010s — too was the product of social media-based populism.Perhaps there will never be a more vivid example of the power of combining populism with social media than what happened in the US in 2016.When then businessman Donald Trump descended an escalator to announce he would run for president, he did so by simply going into a tirade attacking immigrants, specifically Mexicans, who he said were murders and rapists.It was a shocking racist charge for most Americans, but they were not the target of the vile message.Rather, the target was racists, nativists and others who would rather keep America white and the horde bought the attack on immigrants, hook, line  and sinker.The horde was ready to devour the racists attacks because Trump had served an appetizer in his racist badmouthing of then President Barack Obama, about whom Trump thuggishly lied that he was born in Kenya and therefore not eligible to be US president.This was demagoguery unlike anything America had seen before, and in hindsight worse than Europe and America combined had witnessed.So much such that when Trump combined this racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric with anti-establishment rhetoric and projected himself as an outsider who would “drain the swamp” in Washington as president, he found the winning formula that propelled him to the White House as president to the shock of the nation and the whole world.As a befitting a book's ending, Trump was trounced at the polls in November before he could damage America any more.Despite his riding into power as a populist to save the hoi polloi, he only used the office to enrich himself and reward his cronies.That is what lies ahead if Kenyans make a mistake and allow themselves  to be fooled by our version of Trump trying to ride on the populism based on hatred of Raila Odinga in certain parts of the country - and giving false promises of being the deliverer of Wanjiku from her misery. He will not do such. And I do not wish to be here telling you I told you so.Samuel Omwenga is a legal and political analyst"
532,Justice Njoki Ndungu car still missing after being stolen in Nairobi,"Police are still looking for one of the missing official cars belonging to Supreme Court judge justice Njoki Ndungu.A driver attached to the judge was Friday night attacked and robbed of the car in Githurai Mwihoko area, Nairobi.Justice Ndungu was not on board at the time of the incident.The driver identified as Stephen Thuku was not injured in the drama.He had apparently dropped the judge at her home several kilometres away and was alone at the time of the incident.He told police he was driving the Toyota Landcruiser Prado at about 7.30 pm when he was blocked by another car whose registration numbers he did not take.Three gunmen who had pistols jumped into the four-wheel-drive car belonging to the judge and bundled the driver to the back seat.The driver said the gunmen took control of the car and drove around the city including up to Kayole before they abandoned him in Kibiku area, Ngong.He said he lost Sh110,000 to the gang.The gang also took with them two sets of number plates that were in the car.Police believe the gang was interested in the car.A search for it is ongoing, police said Sunday.Police said the car had registration number KCN 117M on it at the time of the incident.The spare numbers that were inside are KBX 495M and GKB 020V.Police have asked the public who may spot it to report to them."
533,"Indonesia Boeing 737 passenger plane crash site found, navy says","Indonesian authorities say they have found the location where they believe a Boeing 737 passenger plane crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from the country's capital Jakarta on Saturday.The Sriwijaya Air jet was carrying 62 people when it disappeared from radar four minutes into its journey to Pontianak in West Kalimantan province.On Sunday, signals thought to be from the jet's flight recorder were traced.More than 10 ships have now been deployed to the site with navy divers.""We have detected signals in two points, this could be the black box,"" the chief of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, Bagus Puruhito, said.Investigators are also analysing items they believe to be wreckage from the aircraft, including a wheel and what they say could be part of the plane's fuselage.A spokesman for the Jakarta police, Yusri Yunus, said two bags had been received from the search and rescue agency.""The first bag contained passengers' properties, another bag contained body parts,"" he told reporters, adding: ""We are still identifying these findings.""Search and rescue efforts were suspended overnight but resumed early on Sunday. Four planes have also been deployed to help with the search.The missing aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes.What happened to the aircraft?The Sriwijaya Air passenger plane departed Jakarta airport at 14:36 local time (07:36 GMT) on Saturday.Minutes later, at 14:40, the last contact with the plane was recorded, with the call sign SJY182, according to the transport ministry.The usual flight time to Pontianak, in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes.The aircraft did not send a distress signal, according to the head of national search and rescue agency Air Marshal Bagus Puruhito.It is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com.Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosiFisherman Solihin, who goes by one name, told the BBC Indonesian service he had witnessed a crash and his captain decided to return to land.""The plane fell like lightning into the sea and exploded in the water,"" he said. ""It was pretty close to us, the shards of a kind of plywood almost hit my ship.""A number of residents of an island near where the plane disappeared told the BBC they had found objects they thought were from the plane.Who was on board the flight?There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say.Relatives of the passengers have been waiting anxiously at the airport in Pontianak, as well as at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.""I have four family members on the flight - my wife and my three children,"" Yaman Zai told reporters through tears.""[My wife] sent me a picture of the baby today... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?""What do we know about the plane?According to registration details, the plane was a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500.It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said.Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-East Asian destinations.The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018.A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city.That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots.It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service.

534,Murder weapon recovered as son confesses to killing family members in Kiambu incident,"A son to a couple which was killed in cold blood together with three others in Karura area, Kiambu county has confessed he committed the cold blood incident.The 23-year-old university IT student was Friday arrested as a prime suspect into the incident after a three-day manhunt.Police said they arrested the son identified as Lawrence Simon Warunge after he went missing since Tuesday when his parents, two brothers and a worker were brutally murdered at their home in Kiambaa Constituency, Kiambu county.After he was arrested, he later confessed to the incident and led police to a residence in Mai Mahiu area on Saturday where they recovered the killer weapon- a kitchen knife-, clothes, shoes and a piece of paper.He had thrown the exhibits to a pit latrine. Police dug the wall of the latrine and used ropes to recover the exhibits from the 20-feet deep pit.He also took police to an open field in the same area where he said he burnt some of the evidence.Lawrence claims he killed the five alone, police said.But police said they are open to a possibility there were other players.The most chilling part is where Lawrence said he caught up with his father-Nicholas Njenga Warunge-as he escaped from him after he broke one of his legs after jumping off a balcony.“He says the father was hit by an electric cable as he ran away and jumped off the balcony and was indisposed further after he fractured a leg.This gave him time to catch up with him and killed him like a snake,” said an officer who had heard the confession.The father’s body had 34 stab wounds.Lawrence’s girlfriend who lived in the house in Mai Mahiu is also being held for interrogation.Lawrence said after he murdered the five using a kitchen knife at about 8 pm he jumped onto a motorcycle and rode up to the nearby Wangige shopping centre where he took a public service vehicle to Mai Mahiu while carrying the killer weapon and other recovered evidence.The bodaboda rider is yet to be found for questioning.In his chilling confession, he said on arrival at Mai Mahiu, he went to an open field in the area where he burnt some of them on Tuesday, January 5 at about 11 pm.Detectives from the Homicide Unit visited the site and collected the debris for analysis.The officers and the suspect donned white surgery clothes as they visited the scenes where he disposed of the exhibits.Lawrence told police that his parents were “satanic and killers” hence deserved to die.Lawrence is a university student in the city and was initially thought to have gone to school.His mobile phone signal was traced to Mai Mahiu, Naivasha.It was later traced to Thika and later to Kabete area on Friday.Police said the suspect went to a relative’s home in Ngongoro area to seek refuge there before they were alerted Friday night.He was later arrested when he told police his parents were “satanic and cruel”.Police had thought at least five people were involved in the murder of Nicholas Njoroge Warunge, his wife Annie, sons Christian and Maxwell and a construction worker James Kinyanjui.Their badly mutilated bodies were found in their Kiambaa home on Tuesday and Wednesday.It is believed a dispute over property was the motive of the murder.The bodies were moved to the mortuary where a post-mortem is expected on Monday.Nothing was stolen from the compound during the incident.Warunge had arrived in Kenya from the USA where he worked as a nurse for Christmas holidays about 11 days before his murder.His two elder daughters survived the cold blood murder because they had the previous day gone to school.Neighbours said they are in secondary school.Annie who worked with Kiambu County Government as a psychologist nurse and two of their children were found murdered and the bodies lying in the compound.Lawrence told police he first killed the mason in his house that is few meters away from the main house by slitting his throat.He then made his way into the house through the rear door, where he found his mother Annie, and hacked her to death before slitting her throat.The commotion in the kitchen drew the attention of the second victim, his cousin Maxwell Njenga, Warunge’s 13-year-old who was confronted along the corridor and cut in the head and throat.His blood brother Christian Njenga who detectives say was killed and his throat slit on his bed had just turned 13 on December 26, 2020.Lawrence claims he killed them all. He claimed his father Warunge was in the master bedroom upstairs at the time of the attack.He rushed to the balcony on sensing danger and jumped down where he broke his leg but was caught up and stabbed him several times and left for the dead.He has 34 stab wounds and a slit throat. Kiambu police boss Ali Nuno said they will also revisit past unsolved murder incidents that happened in the family and are probably related to the latest murder.Last Tuesday’s incident was the fifth in the family according to Nuno.He said the first victim was killed in 2016 when one Allan Warunge, a brother to Njoroge was a victim twice.He was shot for the first time and confined on a wheelchair before his assailants pursued him later.“There was an incident which involved Alan Njire Waruinge in 2016 who was a victim after being shot twice after being confined on a wheelchair. And there was Kenneth Mungai Waruinge who was assassinated alongside with his niece thereafter,” said Nuno.“Kinyanjui Kamau, a family member was also killed in unclear circumstances.”"
535,Sonko to take a 10-year break from politics,"Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has declared a 10-year break from politics.This comes as he also announced that he will withdraw a case he filed stopping Nairobi’s next month gubernatorial by-election to allow those seeking the position to battle it out.“I will stay away from politics for 10 years since people say God’s time is the best. Even when Uhuru failed in 2002 he waited until 2013. Nairobi is bigger than anyone,"" Sonko said on Saturday.""Because Nairobi is big and it needs a leader, I’m ready to withdraw the case for people to elect their own chosen Governor.”Speaking in Makueni on Saturday during the burial ceremony of James Ngui Ndambuki, uncle to Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr in Makueni County, Sonko warned against political machinations aimed at circumventing the by-election and vet deputy governor nominee Anne Mwenda Kananu.The former governor maintained that he withdrew Kananu’s name for deputy governor nominee as well as the by-election to allow those seeking the position to battle it out.“It is a must for Nairobi residents to get the Governor they want. Not to bring in someone who was elected which is not lawful. They need to go for a by-election and elect the person whom they love through the ballot,” he added.On January 9, 2020, Sonko nominated Kananu to deputize him in a letter addressed to former assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi saying the decision was in line with article 180(5) of the Constitution and the Supreme Court Advisory of March 9, 2018.The move came after Polycarp Igathe resigned from the Deputy Governor's position in January 2018.The County  Assembly has set next week Friday to have Kananu vetted by the Appointments Committee.After vetting, the appointment committee will proceed to report writing and table it before the assembly for the MCAs to either reject or approve.On January 22, 2020, the High Court declined to issue orders stopping the county assembly from vetting Kananu for the DG’s position.It was the same day her name was tabled in the assembly and committed to the appointment committee.At this point, IEBC Nairobi County returning Officer Joseph Eroo had cleared and handed over the clearance certificate to Kananu paving way for her vetting as per the guidelines, paving the way from her vetting.He also revealed that Acting Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu had confirmed that Kananu was a member of the Jubilee Party and the sequence of clearance was not a worrying issue.""Ours is to confirm that the nominee belongs to the same party and the Registrar of Political Parties can confirm, which was done that Kananu belongs to Jubilee Party,' Eroo said."
536,"Baba Yao: An opportunist, a strategist or both?","The announcement by former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu that he would run for Nairobi governor may not have come as a surprise to many.It wouldn't be the first time Waititu grabbed an opportunity that has presented itself to seek an elective seat.Waititu or Baba Yao — a moniker that was added to his official title — has run for two parliamentary seats that fell vacant and won both times.When Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was impeached by the Senate on December 18, 2020, another opportunity presented itself and Waititu wasted no time in declaring his interest in standing in the ensuing by-election.The Senate voted overwhelmingly to uphold four charges brought against Sonko by MCAs, which included gross violation of the Constitution, abuse of office, misconduct and crimes against national law.Waititu was also impeached in the same manner. The Senate voted for his removal  on January 29, 2020 after finding him guilty of three charges by the  Kiambu County Assembly.Waititu became the first governor to be found guilty by the Senate. The three main charges were gross misconduct, abuse of office and engaging in corruption. (Embu Governor Martin Wambora's impeachment was overturned by the courts)The former Kiambu governor has touted himself as the best person to take over the leadership of Nairobi county.“I am offering myself to serve the people of Nairobi on an independent ticket,” Waititu said when he announced his candidature.Political analyst Daniel Orogo said Waititu's declaration should not be considered a mere joke.“Touted as a ghetto politician, he could appeal to many Nairobi residents come voting day. His instant justice gratifies many, especially hawkers, mkokoteni pushers and largely hustlers who might want a defender against city askaris,” he said.He said Waititu has been a beneficiary of tragedies adding that his ascent to political positions has been amazing.“Baba Yao is a canny politician with a mastery of jungle law and a beneficiary of political tragedies,” Orogo said.Political commentator Joseph Mutua said, however, Waititu is seeking the attention of Deputy President William Ruto in his quest to become governor for Nairobi.“We know before Kiambu MCAs impeached him, he was wielding a lot of power in pushing Deputy President William Ruto's agenda. He has since lost that influence. It is even said that the DP and his allies deleted his contacts,” he added.Mutua said Waititu, by declaring interest to run for the governor seat, wants to show the DP and his allies that it was too early to write him off.The Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu has already cleared Waititu for the race and stated that her role was to ensure that the former Kiambu governor had resigned from a political party within the stipulated period. Waititu will be run as an independent candidate.Leaders and legal experts have given varied opinions, some saying Waititu and Sonko are barred by law from contesting any seat unless the courts quash their impeachments by the Senate.Some have said said a judicial interpretation was required as Kenyans might not comprehend the complex legal questions arising from Waititu’s candidature.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on Wednesday published Waititu's name among 12 independent candidates seeking the City Hall throne.Waititu had earlier accused the IEBC and the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission of engaging in a smear campaign against him.He explained that though he faces a corruption case, he has not been convicted of any offence —innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.Born on January 1, 1962, Waititu was a humble sand seller in Njiru, Nairobi, before trying his hands at politics.His political career began in 2002 when he was elected to City Hall as a councillor for Njiru ward on a Kanu ticket. He was the only Kanu councillor at City Hall.He then became deputy mayor, after about four years. While at City Hall, he became a fierce rival of then Embakasi MP David Mwenje, now deceased. The two were engaged in numerous confrontations but Mwenje did not seek re-election in the 2007 General Election.Waititu contested the seat on PNU but lost narrowly to Mugabe Were (ODM), who was killed in unclear circumstances after assuming office.The vacancy prompted a by-election, which Waititu won after trouncing ODM’s Esther Passaris.When Parliament was dissolved ahead of the 2013 General Election, Waititu declared interest in the Nairobi governor’s seat.Many dismissed him as a joker, owing to his frequent clashes with the police. He was once captured on television cameras hurling stones at police and slapping an alleged land grabber. He lost the seat to Evans Kidero but garnered 617,839 votes against Kidero’s 692,483.Another opportunity to seek an elective position presented itself in 2015 following the fatal shooting of Kabete MP George Muchai.Waititu vied for the seat and won, then announced that his intention was to send Kiambu Governor William Kabogo packing.He trounced Kabogo in Jubilee nominations garnering 353,600 votes against Kabogo’s 69,916.He was known for giving handouts and casual jobs to young recovering alcoholics, a controversial policy. He also led the charge against illicit liquor in Kiambu, smashing legitimate businesses, as well as others When he was impeached, Kiambu Deputy Governor James Nyoro then assumed office as stipulated by the law."
537,Children not yet back to school should report - Matiang'i,"Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has called upon security officials to get children who are not yet back to school and have them in school.The CS spoke at Nyambaria Boys School where he was assessing the state of school a few days after reopening.Matiang'i was with Health PS Susan Mochache, County Commissioner Amos Mariba, Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose, Principal Boaz Owino, and Nyamira Woman representative Jerusha Momanyi.Matiang'i insisted that all children must be in school without any hindrance, and cautioned any school head against sending students home for school fees.""Let the children be in school first and as government we will handle the rest. Let us give peace of mind to our children to study,"" the security boss said.Matiang'i however noted with a lot of concern, the missing 61 student from the school (Nyambaria) where he called the school principal and the county security team to ensure the missing student are back with immediate effect.""It is worrying that in a school with more than 2000 students, we can have some students absent, but I am calling upon security officials to ensure they come back to school because they are required to be in school,"" the CS said."

539,Indonesian passenger plane missing after take-off,"A passenger plane with more than 50 people on board has gone missing shortly after take-off from the Indonesian capital Jakarta.The Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737 lost contact en route to Pontianak in West Kalimantan province, officials said.Flight tracking website Flightradar24.com said the aircraft had lost more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in altitude in less than a minute.Pictures of what seemed to be aircraft debris appeared on TV and social media.A number of residents of Lancang island, near where the plane disappeared, told the BBC Indonesian service they had found objects they thought were from the plane.The transport ministry said search and rescue efforts were under way.It said last contact with the plane, with the call sign SJY182, was made at 14:40 local time (07:40 GMT).According to registration details, the plane is a 27-year-old Boeing 737-500.Sriwijaya Air, a local carrier, said it was still gathering information about the flight.The plane is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model involved in two major crashes in recent years.The first of those, in October 2018, involved an Indonesian Lion Air flight which plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta killing 189 people.Transport including aviation accidents are relatively common in Indonesia, because of overcrowding, aging infrastructure and lax safety standards."

541,"Vandals steal Sh500,000 road signs, lights, railings","Criminals increasingly are destroying and stealing road 'furniture' - signs, railings and lights - for scrap metal.In the last few days, the Kenya Urban Roads Authority has lost Sh500,000 such equipment, endangering safety along new roads.“Police have arrested two people destroying and stealing the median metal grills along newly dualled Ngong Road in Nairobi,” Kura’s director general Eng Silas Kinoti said in a statement.Michael Maina, 35, and Joseph Lokenyi, 30, were arraigned before the Kilimani law court on Monday for destroying and vandalising road furniture. Accomplices were on the run.Kura said another vandal was sentenced by a Madaraka court to two and half years in jail for vandalising the Outering Road.“I urge motorist to drive carefully and I warn vandals the law will sooner rather than later catch up with them. They should prepare for the dire consequences of destroying public property,” Kinoti said.He urged the members of the public to report vandalism immediately to authorities through online platforms.Destruction of road utilities is a serious economic crime and undermines road safety.Each year billions of shillings are lost through destruction and theft of street poles and lights, traffic lights, guard rails, road signs and drainage covers and slabs through vandalism and reckless driving.“While the authority has put up stringent measures to mitigate this situation, it is disheartening for any sensible person to destroy what is meant to serve all, thus endangering  the lives of others,” Kinoti added.Fixtures are taken to scrap metal dealers and sold for cheap prices.The government invests more than Sh300 billion each year on road infrastructure for Vision 2030 and the Big 4 agenda to make Kenya a medium-level economy in 10 years.(Edited by V.

542,From shooting to strangling: New trend in killings linked to police,"Ramadhan Bakari, a 17-year-old Form 2 student from Balozi High School, was strangled to death in a suspected extrajudicial killing. Prior to that, he was severely tortured as his body bore injury marks on the head, arms and legs. The injuries to his head were also serious enough to have led to his death as they had caused bleeding in the brain. Blunt trauma, which is mainly associated with being beaten by a blunt object, is the most likely form of violence that led to the injuries visible on his body. These were the findings of an autopsy December 29, 2020, by two senior pathologists at the City Mortuary. Bakari and a friend were allegedly arrested by police officers on December 10 at their home in Eastleigh Section 1 in broad daylight — around 4pm. Witnesses even said they knew the officers as they operate in the area and are known to them.Although the friend was released a few hours later after his family followed up, Bakari was taken away. His family was informed much later about the arrest and also made a follow up at Pangani police station. Officers at the station denied arresting him. So the frantic search for Bakari began. For the next few days, the family followed up with various police stations in the area including Muthaiga, Kamukunji and Central. In all the police stations, they denied holding such a person. About two weeks later, a friend of a friend of the family who works at the city mortuary saw Bakari’s story on television, including his picture. He advised the family to visit the morgue to check there. On Christmas Day, the family visited the morgue and alas! The body was there! He was no more. His body had visible injuries, including marks around his neck.HAKI Africa had been working with the family for days before the discovery of the body and assisted to have the autopsy performed. Besides the government pathologist, HAKI Africa also got a private pathologist to be present and represent the organisation and the family at the autopsy. The police and Ippoa were also present. It was at the autopsy that the revelation of strangulation was made. There was a clear mark around the entire neck and on checking the inside part, the pathologists confirmed the mark was a sign of force exerted around the neck either by a rope or wire.The horror is that this was not such first incident with strangulation marks. On following up, HAKI Africa confirmed that before Bakari’s case, there were at least two other recent cases of individuals found dead with similar strangulation marks after allegedly being picked by persons believed to be police officers. Could it be that those involved in the killings are resorting to new ways of murdering their victims? Shooting is traceable as the bullet remains, if found, could be linked to a gun and subsequently, the shooter allocated the gun. However, strangulation only points to a killing but leaves nothing to trace the killer. Bakari’s case is now with Ipoa. The autopsy report is a major part of the evidence and will inform the next steps in seeking justice for the family. However, we must interrogate the new trend that is now being used in cases linked to police. In the case of Bakari, besides strangulation, there were other clear injuries inflicted on him. There’s a possibility his murderers first beat him up to weaken him before finally choking him to death with a rope or wire. Whatever the sequence of the injuries, the clear fact is that it should not be happening in our country. It is a despicable crime.The authorities must move swiftly to end this emerging trend in the New Year. Since the officers who arrested Bakari are known, they must be investigated to ascertain the role they played, if any, in his death. Killing, whether by strangulation or otherwise, must be stopped and those responsible put behind bars for life."
543,Son arrested in probe on Kiambu murder mystery of five family members,"A son to a couple which was killed in cold blood together with three others in Karura area, Kiambu county was on Friday arrested as a suspect into the incident.Police said they arrested the son identified as Lawrence Warunge after he went missing since Tuesday when his parents, two brothers and a worker were brutally murdered at their home.Lawrence, a university student in the city, was initially thought to have gone to school but it was established he was not there.His mobile phone signal was traced to Naivasha and it is not clear how and why.It was later traced to Thika and later to Kabete area.Police said the suspect went to a relative’s home in Ngongoro area to seek refuge there before they were alerted Friday night.And when he was arrested, he told police his parents were “satanic and cruel” to him.He had in December 2020 gone to a chief’s office in their home and claimed his parents wanted to bewitch him.According to police, his mother who is also dead came and picked him saying he had mental issues.“The matter was never recorded because the mother came for him saying he was unwell,” said an officer aware of the probe.It is believed at least five people were involved in the murder of Nicholas Njoroge Warunge, his wife Annie, sons Christian and Maxwell and a construction worker James Kinyanjui.Their badly mutilated bodies were found in their Kiambaa home on Tuesday and Wednesday.It is believed a dispute over property was the motive of the murder.According to the investigators, the absence of any form of forced entry or exit in the razor wire that surrounds the compound shows the killers were well known to the family.It is believed that they made their way into the house through the rear door, where they found Annie, the wife of slain businessman and USA based nurse Waruinge, and hacked her to death before slitting her throat.The commotion in the kitchen drew the attention of the second victim, Maxwell Njenga, Warunge’s 13-year-old nephew, who was confronted along the corridor and cut in the head and throat.Christian Njenga who detectives say was killed and his throat slit on his bed had just turned 13 on December 26, 2020.Police believe Waruinge was in the master bedroom upstairs at the time of the attack.He rushed to the balcony on sensing danger and jumped down where the killers caught up with him and stabbed him several times and left him for the dead.He has 34 stab wounds and a slit throat.The bodies were moved to the mortuary where a post-mortem is expected Monday.Nothing was stolen from the compound during the incident.Kiambu police boss Ali Nuno said they will also revisit past unsolved murder incidents that happened in the family and are probably related to the latest murder.“The killers seem to have been on an elimination mission. Some of the victims may have been subdued to a level they could not raise alarm for help,” said Nuno.Tuesday’s incident was the fifth in the family according to Nuno.He said the first victim was killed in 2016 when one Allan Warunge, a brother to Njoroge was a victim twice.He was shot for the first time and confined on a wheelchair before his assailants pursued him later.“There has been an incident which involved Alan Njire Waruinge in 2016 who was a victim after being shot twice after being confined on a wheelchair. And there was Kenneth Mungai Warunge who was assassinated alongside with his niece thereafter.”“Kinyanjui Kamau, a family member was also killed in unclear circumstances,” said Nuno.He said these incidents point to something wrong in the family or an interested party.The first victim to be found dead at the scene was Kinyanjui, who had been brought to the site for construction by Njoroge’s brother-in-law to construct a house.Warunge had arrived in Kenya from the USA where he worked as a nurse for Christmas holidays about 11 days ago.His two elder daughters survived the cold blood murder because they had the previous day gone to school. Neighbours said they are in secondary school.Annie who worked with Kiambu County Government as a psychologist nurse and two of their children were found murdered and the bodies lying in the compound."
544,Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account,"US President Donald Trump has been permanently suspended from Twitter ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence"", the company says.Twitter said the decision was made ""after close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account"".It comes amid a Big Tech purge of the online platforms used by Mr Trump and his supporters.Some lawmakers and celebrities have been calling for years on Twitter to ban Mr Trump altogether. Former First Lady Michelle Obama tweeted on Thursday that the Silicon Valley giants should stop enabling Mr Trump's ""monstrous behaviour"" and permanently expel him.Why was Trump banned?Mr Trump was locked out of his account for 12 hours on Wednesday after he called the people who stormed the US Capitol ""patriots"".Hundreds of his supporters entered the complex as the US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election. The ensuing violence led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer.Twitter warned then that it would ban Mr Trump ""permanently"" if he breached the platform's rules again.After being allowed back on Twitter, Mr Trump posted two tweets on Friday that the company cited as the finals straws.In one, he wrote: ""The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!""Twitter said this tweet ""is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition'"".In the next, the president tweeted: ""To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.""Twitter said this was ""being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate"".Twitter said both of these tweets were ""in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy""."

546,Did Kang'ata colour outside the lines or was it an Overton Window reality?,"Quid est Veritas? What is the truth?This was the most germane question asked by Pontius Pilate.He is best known for being the Roman official who presided over the trial of Jesus and later ordered his crucifixion, but not before wavering, and even exonerating Jesus before bending to the will of the crowd, and condemning him to death.The Roman soldiers and Pharisees had arrested Jesus and presented him to Pontius Pilate. Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus responded. “You say that I am a King. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.”“Quid est Veritas? What is truth?” retorted Pilate.This week, we have been pondering over our own truth. This search for the truth was triggered by Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata.Kang'ata, who also doubles up as the Senate Majority Chief Whip, wrote a candid letter to his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta.Kang’ata said he was reliably informed by research findings that the BBI was not popular in Mt Kenya region.Although he admitted that his poll was not scientific, he advised the President that it was extremely worrying to note that only 20 per cent support BBI in Mt Kenya. \Kang'ata further advised that the rejection of BBI in the region could be a harbinger of the upcoming Nairobi gubernatorial race, were Jubilee to field a candidate.Following swiftly, a group of 10 governors and MPs from Central castigated Kang'ata for breaching protocol and addressing the President through a letter and leaking it to the mainstream and social media.They asserted that it was premature for Kang'ata to judge BBI’s popularity in Mt Kenya given the bill had just been published and public participation and grassroots awareness was yet to be conducted.They claimed that it was preposterous and a serious misrepresentation of facts and reality in Mt Kenya to allege that the region is opposed to BBI.Begs the question, Quid est Veritas? What is the truth? Who between the governors and Kang'ata is telling the truth?And by leaking the letter to the media, did Kang'ata colour outside the lines, is he a marionette par excellence, or he was simply operating within the Overton Window?Often times we mistakenly believe that the truth is synonymous with opinion. And particularly within the context of politics and faith, we think that the more people that hold a certain opinion, or the more powerful the opinion holder is, or the bigger the following the opinion holder commands, then their opinion must be the truth.But the reality is that the truth cannot be affirmed on the basis of blind faith or allegiance. Something is not true simply because you believe it; neither is it untrue simply because you don’t believe it. Truth simply is. Whether you like it or not, believe it or not, or know it or not. It simply is.Truth invites questions because it is not a question that should only be asked, but rather one that must also be answered because it is verifiable and testable, based on credible information and sufficient evidence. Truth is the yardstick by which opinion should be tested. And if opinion fails the test of truth, then that opinion should be abandoned.I submit that Kang'ata was operating within the boundaries of the Overton Window, which is a model for understanding how ideas in society change over time and influence politics.The Overton Window is a non-physical space where the ideas inside that space are politically safe and the public is willing to accept them.Any idea that falls outside that space is perceived as too radical for the public to accept. Any politician that supports ideas outside the Overton Window risks getting defeated in the next election.This is premised on the reality that politicians are limited in what political ideas they can support.They do not support whatever political idea they choose to, or are asked by the powers that be, to champion.Politicos only pursue political ideas that are widely accepted by their electorate at a given time because they do not want to hurt their electoral chances.The biggest mistake that politicos suffering from hubris syndrome make is that they have the power to expand or shrink the Overton Window without unduly risking their electoral support.But the reality is that the window shifts through a slow evolution of societal values and norms, and not control from on high.And this is what Kang'ata was attempting to communicate to the President by advising him to cease and desist from using hard power of the provincial administration and adopt the soft power of persuasion to popularise the BBI in Mt Kenya.Kang'ata is an ambitious man, and from all indications, it is highly likely that he is eyeing the Murang’a governor position in 2022.Astute ambitious politicians are alive to the fact that their business is not in shifting the Overton Window, but in detecting where the window is, and then moving to be in accordance with it.And this is what Kang'ata has done. His non-scientific research has informed him that the BBI is not within the Overton Window in Mt Kenya.He has not coloured outside the lines and disrespected the President. Rather he has located the Overton Window and its contents. He has done what any ambitious politician would have done.Finally, my unsolicited advice is to Uhuru is that effective political tactics are like good underwear; they provide the perfect firm support, but should never be publicly seen. Likewise, either your political moves have become too obvious, or your operators have become too unconvincing.In a room where people unanimously maintain a conspiracy of silence, one word of truth sounds like a pistol shot - Czesław Miłosz"
547,Ruto signals Jubilee departure as allies embrace UDA party,"Deputy President William may as well have dumped Jubilee after a host of his close allies embraced the United Democratic Alliance and launched the Hustler Centre office.The UDA outfit has been formerly registered by the registrar of political parties after a successful name change from PDR.Friday's launch of the UDA headquarters and the unveiling of party candidates for the upcoming by-elections left no doubt the DP has technically quit Jubilee.Ruto's Tangatanga allies wore UDA caps as they announced they had finally landed home after what they termed as humiliation at Jubilee headquarters.Falling short of calling it quits from Jubilee the DP's troops dared the ruling party for a duel in the forthcoming by-elections.The DP confidants who included Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali said they will work with UDA.They said, UDA being a Jubilee affiliate, they risk no sanction as they had merely restated their cooperation with the rebranded outfit.“We all know that in the Jubilee coalition there are so many rooms, there is a Jubilee party room and a UDA one. The Jubilee room has been locked but we want to find a place to sleep in the UDA room because the door is open,” Murkomen said at the new UDA offices.The offices are located along Makindi Road, off Riara Road, and has been refurbished and repainted the wheelbarrow party seen as the DP's 2022 political vehicle.Murkomen said that the Tangatanga team was only cooperating with a political party that already has a working agreement with the mother Jubilee party and therefore would not be intimidated.“These members here, we are working with a party that signed a pre-election coalition agreement before the last election as PDR but has now been renamed UDA,' Murkomen.The Hustler Centre appears to be a reincarnation of the Jubilee Asili Centre which was opened by the DP's allies mid last year after Ruto's allies were axed from plum party posts.The DP's Tangatanga team came under heavy criticism for operating a parallel office to the Jubilee one with President Uhuru Kenyatta's allies challenging Ruto to quit over the move.The office was later closed down with Ruto's allies insisting that the landlord had been intimidated by the state machinery to evict them from the building.However, Friday's move by the DP's allies to openly embrace the UDA party whose slogan is the Wheelbarrow-Ruto's Hustler National campaign slogan-left no doubt of a decision to quit Jubilee.“We have been in a party in which we have been warned not to even set foot at the headquarters, UDA being an affiliate Jubilee party we are ready to come here and work with it,” said Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wa.The Ruto ally tore into Jubilee officials including Secretary general Raphael Tuju who last year, in a public statement, declared that Ruto was not welcome to do his 2022 politics .“Those who chased us and declared us personal non grata at the the Jubilee headquarters, we now have a Jubilee affiliate party that has hospitable headquarters,” he said in a scathing attack.Lifting the lid on the real motive, Ichungwa said the Wheelbarrow is what makes all Kenyans equal, referring to the UDA symbol which is also Ruto's signature slogan.“Under the wheelbarrow and the hustler nation movement, we shall rescue the economy of this country from sinking at a time when the leadership is focusing on sharing positions,” Ichung'wa declared.Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali insisted that the hustler nation will work closely with UDA because it is the “place to be.”""UDA is just one of the rooms of Jubilee and we are not ashamed to join it, we shall continue to support UDA,"" said Washiali.The UDA party unveiled bishop Margret Wanjiru as its flagbearer for the February 18 Nairobi by-election.This opened a new battlefront with President Uhuru who us expected to back another candidate in a partnership with the ODM boss Raila Odinga.Matungu poll will be held on March 4.Alex Lanya flying the party flag in Matungu poll.Former senator Johnson Muthama who is the UDA chairman also unveiled ex-Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Muia Kiala as the party's candidate for Machakos Senate race on March 18.Evans Kaikai Masinde has been handed the certificate of the party as the Kabuchai constituency aspirant for the by-election that will be held the same day."

552,We can impeach Trump in a week - congressman,"Democratic Congressman James Clyburn has said that impeachment proceedings could go ahead soon if Vice-President Mike Pence and the cabinet do not remove Donald Trump from office via the 25th Amendment.Speaking on CNN, he said: “I believe in the next six to seven days we can impeach but not remove.”The reason he said that is because while the Democrats can impeach Trump in the House of Representatives when things move to the Senate they get more complicated for the Democrats in two key ways:There's not much time to hold a Senate trial before he leaves office anywayIt will be difficult for them to muster the two-thirds vote required to actually remove him from the presidencyHowever there are signs that some Republicans could support the move.Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska said earlier he would consider articles of impeachment because Trump had ""disregarded his oath of office""."
553,"Scientists surprised to discover two dwarf giraffes in Namibia, Uganda","Being tall is the giraffe's competitive advantage, giving it the pick of leaves from the tallest trees, so scientists were stunned to find two giraffe dwarves on different sides of Africa.""It's fascinating what our researchers out in the field found,"" Julian Fennessy, co-founder of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, told Reuters in a video call on Friday. ""We were very surprised.""Most giraffes grow to 15 - 20 feet (4.5 - 6 metres), but in 2018, scientists working with the foundation discovered an 8 1/2-foot (2.6 metre) giraffe in Namibia.Three years earlier, they had also found a 9-foot 3-inch (2.8 metre) giraffe in a Ugandan wildlife park.They published their findings in the British Medical Journal at the end of last month.In both cases, the giraffes had the standard long necks but short, stumpy legs, the paper said.Skeletal dysplasia, the medical name for the condition, affects humans and domesticated animals, but the paper said it was rare to see in wild animals.Footage taken by the foundation showed the Ugandan giraffe standing on thick, muscled legs in the dry savanna of Murchison Falls national park in northern Uganda, while a taller animal with the usual long, stick-like legs walked behind it.""Unfortunately there's probably no benefit at all. Giraffes have grown taller to reach the taller trees,"" Fennessy said. He added that it would most likely be physically impossible for them to breed with their normal-sized counterparts.The numbers of the world's tallest mammal have declined by some 40% over the past 30 years to around 111,000, so all four species are classified by conservationists as 'vulnerable'.""It's because of mostly habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, growing human populations, more land being cultivated,"" Fennessy said. ""Combined with a little bit of poaching, climate change"".But conservation efforts have helped numbers start to recover in the past decade, he added."
554,"KDF hails government's affordable housing, targets 62,000 units","Kenya Defense Forces -KDF has hailed the government's plan to incorporates its servicemen and women in the affordable housing project.This comes after the department secured at least 57 units in the recently allocated Park road project.On Friday, the soldiers were taken through a tour of the housing units at Park Road, Nairobi in order to have a feel of what awaits them.Speaking during the tour Colonel Lobaly who is the chairman of KDF's  Affordable Housing Allocation Committee, hailed the project saying that the houses are being sold at highly subsidised rates and paid on an installment basis.The Col said the allocation was successful after KDF signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Housing Corporation under the State Department of Housing and Planning.“We are very pleased to have been considered and allocated some units as pioneer beneficiaries in this flagship project. This shall go a long way in solving housing needs among officers and also give them an opportunity to own assets in the city even when they exit the service,” he said.He added, “We are pleased that our officers will live with their families in more decent houses which are near their places of work. This shall further boost their morale to work due to the good environment they will be living in,” he added.Lobaly said although the houses could not be enough for all officers who applied for allocation, they are confident to get at least 62,000 units when the entire project of 621,523 units is complete.The houses range from one bed-roomed to three bed-roomed houses costing between one million and four million respectively.Boniface Ngochi, the Deputy Director State Department of Housing and Planning said the government provided the 7.9 acres parcel of land where 1,370 units were constructed at Park Road.Ngochi said the payment period is estimated to be at most 20 years or until one retires from civil service, whichever comes first.“It is the government’s plan to ensure all public lands are put into better use as the construction of such affordable houses. The prices are far below the prices one incurs if he buys through a private company.” He added.Sergeant (Sgt) Lucy Wanja who is one of the beneficiaries could not hide her joy after she was shortlisted for a three bed-roomed house for Sh3.5 million.Sgt Wanja who is deployed at the Defence Headquarters Communication Center said she has a reason to smile after 31 years of being in the service.“I am very happy that my application sailed through. I shall now settle with my family and own a luxurious house within the city which shall save much of the rent and transport money I have been incurring over the years. This is indeed a great legacy by His Excellency the President,” said Ms. Wanja who was recruited in 1991.Senior Sergeant Wycliffe Mureka also thanked the president for having such a project.“I traveled all the way from Mombasa to come to view my house. Many a time we are forced to move with our families when a transfer comes but now my family will comfortably settle in Nairobi and I am very pleased with this,” he said.He urged his colleagues to wait for more units to be complete to see whether they will be considered in the next roll-out exercise."
555,Former Othaya MP Mary Wambui lands a new state job,"Labour CS Simon Chelugui has made changes to the chair of trustees of the Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund.The changes were announced in a Gazette Notice on Friday 8, January 2021.Wambui has been appointed as the chairperson of the trustees of the Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund, taking over from Linah Jebii Kilimo (former Marakwet East MP). The CS said that Wambui's term of three years started on January 1, 2021.At the same time, the CS has appointed Prof. Grace Jerotich Cheserek to be the chairperson of the National Employment Authority (NEA) for a period of three years.Hence, the earlier appointment of Mary Wambui as NEA chair has been revoked.Wambui's appointment was temporarily suspended by the Employment and Labour Relations Court in October 2019.Justice Hellen Wasilwa ordered the suspension of the Gazette notice appointing Wambui pending hearing and determination of the petition.The petitioner, Kenya Young Parliamentarians Association, through their lawyers Mwenje & Karanja Co. Advocates, argued that Wambui is not qualified for appointment as Chairperson as per provisions of Section 10 (2) of the National Employment Authority Act.The said section is one of a mandatory nature and not discretionary to entitle the CS to derogate therefrom.""Wambui should not assume office as the Chairperson of the National Employment Authority, as she is a person not qualified under the law to be the Chairperson of the National Employment Authority"" they argued.Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja had also opposed Wambui's appointment, threatening to file a petition seeking to cancel her appointment.Sakaja had said that the appointment goes against Section 10(2) of the National Employment Authority Act as well as the vision of the institution."
556,"Al Shabaab wreaks havoc in Mandera, governor calls for help","Mandera Governor Ali Roba has raised an alarm over the resurgence of the Somalia terror-based group al Shabaab.Roba on Friday said he has been forced to go public about the deteriorating security situation in North Eastern Kenya and particularly Mandera County because people are now living in fear after a return of the Al Shabaab terror group who have occupied strategic locations in the county and the region.He said the group is getting bolder and more aggressive by the day.According to Roba, a serious security crisis is unfolding within Mandera County caused by undeterred movements of terror cells within the county.He said the situation has been developing over the last three months but has reached unprecedented levels now.""The terrorists are collecting livestock by force from helpless pastoralists in the name of Zakkat (offering). This requires a radical approach to manage the trend otherwise we will soon be under terror rule,"" he said.Roba said currently the terrorist group manages more than 60 per cent of Mandera with the will of public suppressed by terror.""They roam freely and the public has kept on reporting these movements (actionable intelligence) but unfortunately the situation has kept on growing from bad to worse,"" he said.He added, ""The terrorists boldly video record their actions and the purpose of the footage remains unclear what the intention is"".The militia group recently attacked an ambulance evacuating an expectant mother to the hospital, killed her husband and injured the driver and a nurse as the mother escaped to a nearby bush.They later torched the ambulance owned by the County Government.in another incident, a vocal assistant chief against the group was abducted on December 18 and beheaded in the cruellest manner in Wajir County along the border with Mandera before his head was thrown in the bush.A police post was attacked and a new building flattened by explosives and mobile phone transmission stations are regularly attacked and masts felled leaving residents cut-off from communication.Roba said highways in Mandera are now controlled by the group that harasses travellers and target civil servants on the roads.""If our public does not stand up and take on Al Shabab with everything they have got in order to get rid of the terror group despite the risks, we are doomed to produce hundreds of thousands of youth every year failing to get access to education and joining the idling lot in our population,"" he said.Roba added, ""The resultant impact will be increased drug abuse, petty crimes like prostitution among other vices of society"".The governor said the government has totally failed to protect Northern Kenya from Al Shabab hence public must fight for their dear lives with everything they have without depending or waiting for anyone.""As it stands, the ugly truth is that Al Shabab has taken control of over 50 per cent of the landmass of Northern Kenya. We have been left with no choice but to liberate ourselves from terror rule that growing stronger by the day. Otherwise, we close the schools because there is no schooling without teachers,"" he said.The governor said there is an urgent need for a radical review and redesign of the security program as it relates to fighting terror because evidently, it is failing miserably.""Buildings mean nothing without teachers. I take this opportunity to plead with my colleagues the leaders of Northern Kenya to prepare our public for an uprising against Al Shabab. It is better we lose thousands of lives fighting terrorists but remain free in our country,"" he said.Roba said though President Uhuru Kenyatta has given them all the support they need in terms of personnel, weapons and every support literally required to fight terror, the onus is upon the security managers to put the security resources to optimal and effective use which is not the case.""Sadly, the security personnel could not even protect themselves forget about protecting the public. We cannot accept to have continuous generational failures of our population,"" he said.He added, ""It is better to die than accept our sovereignty and freedoms to be threatened by terror. This is unacceptable we must rise up as northern Kenya population and its leaders against Al-Shabab with everything we have including our lives. We refuse to be ruled in independent Kenya by the Al Shabab militia""."
557,Omtatah seeks to block Kananu vetting set for Friday next week,"Activist Okiya Omtatah has sued to block the vetting and appointment of Anne Kananu as the deputy governor of Nairobi.If approved to take up the role, Kananu could potentially fill the post of governor left by Mike Sonko who was impeached in December last year.Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura is the current Nairobi governor in an acting capacity.Kananu is set to be vetted by the assembly’s Appointment committee on January 15 after a case challenging her nomination was withdrawn on Thursday.In a public notice, clerk Edward Gichana said Kananu will be vetted in the plenary chamber from 9am. The committee is chaired by the speaker and deputised by the Majority leader Abdi Hassan alias Guyo.In his suit papers, Omtatah says Sonko revoked Kananu’s nomination on December 7 last year. She cannot, therefore, be vetted for appointment as deputy governor.  “Under the Constitution, Kananu cannot be DG and definitely not the Governor since she never assumed office when Nairobi had a Governor,” Omtatah says.Omtatah says that the Constitution contemplates that only a serving deputy governor can assume the office of governor if a vacancy arises.“Kananu was not, and is not, the holder of the office of a Deputy Governor. Hence, an election for both the offices of the Governor and of Deputy Governor must be held unless the impeachment of Sonko is reversed by a Court of competent jurisdiction,” Omtatah says.He has asked the court to declare that Kananu is ineligible to be vetted, appointed, or sworn into office as deputy governor and, subsequently, Nairobi governor.The activist wants the IEBC compelled to announce a vacancy in the office of the deputy governor of Nairobi and prepare for their election alongside that of governor.“Unless the Court intervenes immediately, Kananu who is not lawfully nominated to be vetted as a Deputy Governor because her nomination by Sonko was revoked on 7th December, 2020 will be unlawfully vetted by the County Assembly on 15th January, 2021,” Omtatah says. (edited by o. owino)"
558,Tangatanga MPs vow to rally behind Margaret Wanjiru,"Deputy President William Ruto's allies have vowed to rally their full support behind Margaret Wanjiru's candidacy for Nairobi Governor.This is despite the fact that the Jubilee party will also field its candidate.The party will formally announce its candidate after their nominations set to be conducted on Jan 9.Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said they are still members of the Jubilee Party which has been stormed by cartels and political brokers.""We are still in Jubilee but we are on standby. We have good relations because UDA is an affiliate member,"" he said.He said those associating with the new UDA party face no legal danger.“For now UDA is a Jubilee Coalition member with the highest office holder in Parliament being the Senate Deputy Majority Leader. If there is any disciplinary action it should be directed to those who supported ODM which is our competitor,” Murkomen said.""We have been locked out of Jubilee but we want to remind them that we wrote a coalition agreement. Being our father's party, there are many rooms and UDA is one of the rooms which is ready to accommodate those who feel left out,"" he added.He said their support for Wanjiru, therefore, is in order because she belongs to a party that is an affiliate of Jubilee.""We want the playing field to be open and fair to all players. The shenanigans we are witnessing currently in Nairobi are so pedestrian, unconstitutional and do not make sense on all standards,"" he said.The legislator said the plot to ensure Anne Kananu becomes the deputy governor and take over from impeached Sonko is a violation of the Constitution.""We have already allowed the speaker to be sworn in as the acting governor meaning we started a constitutional process, how can it then be that someone else will be vetted to take over the same process,"" he posed.""This is why we are ready to ready to rally behind Wanjiru and ready to join UDA. We want to tell all our supporters that in your father's house there are many rooms and UDA is just one of them.""On Friday the UDA party announced that Wanjiru will fly its ticket in the Nairobi gubernatorial by-election.The announcement came after the party which is associated with Deputy President William Ruto was launched.The registration of the party is the clearest indication that Ruto's hustler movement is determined to dump the ruling Jubilee Party ahead of next year's general election.The Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu confirmed the successful name change and registration UDA, formerly Party of Development and Reform (PDR).  “The registrar of political parties takes note of the decision taken by your party and the changes effected on January 7, 2021, upon the expiry of the statutory period in line with Section 20(3A) of the PPA,” Nderitu said.With the registrar's green-light, the UDA started an aggressive rebranding campaign including acquiring a spacious office at Kilimani's Makindi Road called Hustler's Centre.Wanjiru, a Bishop at Jesus is Alive Ministries (JIAM) will now battle it out with the likes of Ferdinand Waititu, Mike Sonko among others.Wanjiru has been a member of the Jubilee Party after she dumped ODM.She has previously served as Starehe Constituency MP since 2007.In 2010, Wanjiru risked losing her seat after a vote recount indicated that her opponent Maina Kamanda on a PNU ticket had won the election with a clear margin.She, however, survived after beating Kamanda in a  by-election held on September 20, 2010."
559,Nurses who succumb to Covid to receive compensation,"Nurses who have or may succumb to Covid-19 and other illnesses shall receive compensation should the return to work formula agreed upon by the union and the government is signed.During the negotiations between the parties which commenced under the multi-agency standing committee at the Labour ministry, it was also agreed that the risk allowance for nurses is reviewed to a minimum of Sh15,000.It was further agreed that all nurses who have been hospitalized and have paid their own bills due to the absence of comprehensive medical insurance cover shall be refunded the funds they spent on treatment by employers within the two levels of government.The Kenya National Union of Nurses Secretary General Seth Panyako has asked all striking nurses to stay put until the agreed Return To Work Formula before Labour CS Simon Chelugui is signed by all parties.Speaking in Nairobi on Friday, Panyako said the two levels of government agreed on all items as contained in the draft agreement.He said that despite the national government pledging to fund the RTWF agreed upon, the CoG has refused to sign it arguing that they were not consulted.""The union is waiting for the meeting of the two levels of government on Monday in order to hasten the signing of the RTWF,"" Panyako said.""The CoG has refused to sign the RTWF arguing that they were not consulted during the negotiations which we differ because the CoG secretariat has always attended the meetings.""Nurses have been on strike since December 7 to push for among other issues a risk allowance, adequate personal protective equipment, comprehensive medical insurance cover and delayed salaries.To date, 34 nurses have succumbed to Covid-19 while on duty.Patients in the country have continued to feel the heat of the strike as lab technologists and clinical officers also joined in the strike this week.The clinicians went back on strike after failing to reach an agreement with the CoG on their return to work agreement signing."

We are urging him to come to our rescue,” Mose said.He also said there’s a massive desk shortage at the school.West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi promised to ensure the school gets support from the CDF kitty.He told the Star his office has received information about the challenges facing schools in the area.  “We will have them addressed as soon as possible so that the learners in those institutions can continue learning like others in other schools now that schools have reopened in the midst of coronavirus disease,” Kemosi said."
561,Judge defers cop's murder plea,"The high court has deferred the plea taking of police officer who shot and killed his friend last week in Nyari estate to Tuesday next week.Edgar Mokamba was expected to plead to the murder of Zachary Simwa but the prosecution told the court that the mental examination report was not ready.The prosecution told Justice Hedwig Ong’udi that Mathare Hospital has been closed for a while and will be opened on Monday.They asked the court to defer the plea to allow them to take Mokamba for examination before he is formally charged.However, Mokamba’s  Lawyer Danstan Omari asked the court to allow his client to take a plea without the mental exam.In her ruling, Justice Ong’udi said Mokamba cannot take a plea without a mental exam from the hospital.The judge directed the state to present Mokamba to Mathare Hospital at the earliest date and appear before her on Tuesday next week for mention.Mokamba was also informed of the charge he is facing where it is alleged that he killed Simwa by shooting him.On Thursday lawyer Omari said they intend to write to the DPP to reduce the charge from murder to manslaughter.“We will be imploring the DPP if he finds our story is correct were request to enter into plea bargaining with a view of reducing the charge to manslaughter and he pleads guilty,” Omari said.Mokamba was arrested on December 30 after he shot and killed his close friend Simwa at the Nyari estate where he was on patrol.It is alleged that on December 29 Simwa went to visit Mokamba and they were chewing Miraa together but later he fired 10 bullets that led to the death of the deceased.Mokamba claims that he never meant to shoot his late friend and says he is very remorseful.Speaking to journalists, Omari said that his client and Simwa were seating in the car when they saw a suspicious woman who looked to be of Somali origin.Omari says Mokamba asked the lady to identify herself because she looks suspicious thereafter he allegedly called his boss who came and apprehended the woman.“As he was returning back to the car because he feared the lady might have been a terrorist he accidentally touched the trigger,” Omari said.According to Mokamba, it’s that point that the bullets hit the ground and accidentally hit the deceased in the carOmari said his client is apologizing to the citizens for mishandling his gun saying the deceased was his personal friend for many years and he had no intention of killing him. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
562,Uhuru bastions weak-link in BBI referendum push - poll,"Not even half of President Uhuru Kenyatta's supporters will vote 'YES' in the BBI referendum if the vote was held today.A new poll has revealed that only 36 per cent of Uhuru's supporters will approve the amendments to the 2010 Constitution in a public vote.According to a survey by polling firm Tifa, 24 per cent of Uhuru's backers will vote 'NO' in the referendum while 22 per cent of them will keep off the vote.There have been concerns that Uhuru's base of Mt Kenya is not in support of the Building Bridges Initiative push to amend the supreme law of the land.In contrast, 66 per cent of ODM leader Raila Odinga's supporters will vote 'YES' in the referendum.Only 12 per cent of them will not vote at all.This means that the BBI referendum has the highest approval ratings in Raila's support bastions compared to Uhuru's bases.In terms of the timing of the referendum, 76 per cent of Raila's supporters want it before the next general election while 15 per cent want it after the 2022 polls.The survey shows that only four per cent of the former prime minister's supporters want the referendum held alongside the 2022 elections.Only last week, Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata revealed that his own opinion poll he conducted in Mt Kenya, showed that the referendum will be lost in the region.Conversely, 50 per cent of the supporters of Deputy President William Ruto will vote to reject the BBI referendum, 30 per cent of them will stay away while 13 per cent will vote 'YES'.According to the poll, at least 31 per cent of Ruto's supporters want the referendum before the next general election, 19 per cent same day while 41 per cent want it after the next general election.The poll was conducted with a sample size of 1,550 respondents with a margin of error of +/- 2 per cent.The data was collected between December 8-19, 2020 nationally."
563,Wangari Maathai's Greenbelt gets new bosses,"The Green Belt Movement is beginning the year with two new bosses. GBM has appointed development specialist Nyaguthii Chege as its  new executive director and communications specialist Jane Gitau as chairpersonThe two were appointed late last year but have effectively began work this month in the conservation organisation founded by Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai. ""Chege brings to the position extensive experience and a wealth of knowledge in sustainable development, public sector governance, and human resource development in the non-profit and higher education sectors, and international financial institutions,"" the organisation said. Chege first worked with Wangari Maathai at the GBM as the internal liaison officer, during the organisation's early days.Most recently, she served as careers' director of human rights and international law and lecturer-in-law at Columbia University School of Law in New York.Previously, she worked at Peking University School of Transnational Law in Shenzhen, China, as a staff attorney at the International Program of the Natural Resources Defense Council, as a consultant at the World Bank in Washington DC, and as a legal associate with Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett, a Wall Street law firm.“I am delighted to be back at the Movement. It is an honor to be leading this work at a time when the world needs great models to address some of the most challenging issues of our time,” Chege said.Gitau succeeded Marion Kamau who served as chairperson from June 2017.She is currently the head of communication at Kenya Seed Company and has more than 20 years of experience in strategic leadership in both corporate and international communications.""Her professional experiences span across the fields of gender and development, media, and academia touching lives across the globe to raise critical issues for policy and public information,"" Greenbelt said.Gitau is the president emeritus and fellow of the Public Relations Society of Kenya, and a fellow and secretary-general of the African Public Relations Association.Previously, she has served as a board member to other organisations such as Global Alliance for PR & Communication Management (Portugal), and Trans World Radio (TWR).“The urgency for Kenya, and Africa, to bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic is undeniable. The world needs sound models for how communities can simultaneously build physical and economic resilience, protect biodiversity, and address climate change,"" she said.""By engaging in solutions such as community-led tree planting and household level food security, the GBM experience and approach remains one of the best models out there,” Gitau said.(edited by o. owino)"
564,"Expect more hungry people in towns, Kenya told","Kenyans in towns will not be spared by food shortage in the coming months,  according to a prediction on Kenya’s food security.However, most affected will be people in eastern and northern Kenya, who will need relief food and livestock offtake by May.The outlook says pastoral areas will be most affected because the short rains were below average and there are three dry months ahead.The Famine Early Warning Systems Network, supported by Usaid, also predicts a  gradual decline in livestock body conditions.The early warning platform advises farmers to sell some of their livestock through offtake programmes.Recently, the National Drought and Management Authority also issued an alert over the deterioration in livestock body condition and milk production compared to July and August.“The forecast below-average 2021 long rains are expected to lead to short-lived pasture and water regeneration, and gradual declines in livestock body conditions and production, limiting household access to food and income,” the FewsNet prediction says.It also notes urban families will suffer food shortage due to low income and higher-priced commodities impacting household purchasing power.Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chairman Dubat Amey also recently advised pastoralists in Northeastern to start selling their livestock to avoid losing them during the looming dry season.Amey urged counties to set aside funds to tackle drought. Already, Wajir has this financial year allocated Sh150 million to tackle drought.According to the Nairobi-based Igad Climate Prediction and Application Centre,  there will be hot weather in most parts of the country between now and March.ICPAC last week also issued a mixed outlook for March-May rainfall. The World Meteorological Organization was, however, cautious.“Interested parties should continue to check updates for the latest information,” WMO said in a statement.WMO said La Niña is currently peaking but it will not necessarily lead to drought in East Africa like it did in 2010.WMO said La Niña is just one of the many climatic drivers that affect weather.Nairobi-based non-profit Oxfam also predicted the number of hungry people will rise.Lydia Zigomo, Oxfam Horn, East and Central Africa regional director, said: “The forecasted dry season will be the last straw for many, devastating their remaining crops and cutting their lifeline of food and income.”Farmers, who make up almost 80 per cent of the Horn of Africa’s population, have already been hit hard by severe floods and the biggest desert locust invasion in 70 years.Since January, locusts have damaged crops on 70,000 hectares (172,973.8 acres)  in Kenya.Zigomo added: “Urgent action is needed to provide the assistance desperately needed by millions of hungry people.” (edited by o. owino)"
565,BBI referendum will flop if held today - Tifa poll,"The Building Bridges Initiative referendum would flop if the vote was held today, a new poll has shown.A survey by polling firm Tifa shows that 32 per cent of Kenyans would vote 'NO' to shoot down the vote.The poll shows that only 29 per cent of registered voters will vote 'YES' in support of the BBI referendum.Another 26 per cent of voters said they will not participate in the BBI referendum with 16 per cent of Kenyans unsure if they will vote or not.In voting 'YES', 19 per cent said they will approve the referendum because of more money to counties while 15 per cent agreed with the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister posts for more inclusivity.At least five per cent will do so because of the benefits to youth, another five per cent because of the position of Official Leader of Opposition for runners-up in the polls while 40 per cent had no specific reason given.Of those who would vote 'NO', 32 per cent said they will vote that way because they lack enough information on the BBI proposals.Twenty percent believe it is the wrong priority amidst other challenges the country is facing while 9 percent cited increased political tension and divisions.Six per cent said BBI is increasing political power for Presidency which is a threat to democracy.The poll was conducted with a sample size of 1,550 respondents  with a margin of error of +/- 2 per cent.The results pose a major setback for the BBI proponents lead by President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga who are pushing for constitutional changes.The poll outcome would embolden Deputy President William Ruto's hustler nation brigade which has been rallying Kenyans to reject the proposed law review.Notably, a combination of those who would not vote and the unsure group represents 42 per cent of Kenyans.""This means that there is still a considerable work that needs to be done by champions of both of yes or no campaigns to win over Kenyans to their side,” the survey concludes.The survey established that 68 per cent of those who will not vote either way will do so because of lack information on the BBI proposals.Interestingly, at least 10 per cent of Kenyans believe it will be rigged to ensure its passage by those pushing for constitutional changes.The data was collected between December 8-19, 2020, almost two weeks before Muranga Senator Irungu Kangata wrote a damning letter to Uhuru, warning that BBI could flop in the Mt Kenya region."
566,Nairobi MCAs to vet Sonko nominee for deputy governor next Friday,"The Nairobi assembly has scheduled the vetting of former Governor Mike Sonko's nominee for the deputy position on Friday next week.If approved, Anne Kananu could potentially take over from Acting Governor Benson Mutura as the substantive Nairobi county chief.Assembly clerk Edward Gichana cited the withdrawal of orders suspending Anne Kananu’s vetting by a court on Thursday to proceed with the plan.Nairobi voter Peter Agoro had blocked Kananu’s vetting by the assembly on February 17 last year through a court order. He withdrew the case on Thursday.In a public notice issued in the local dailies Friday, Gichana said Kananu will be vetted by the Appointment committee in the plenary chamber from 9am. The team is chaired by the speaker and deputised by the Majority leader Abdi Hassan alias Guyo.The public can attend the vetting and or submit information on Kananu’s suitability for office.“The submissions may be sent or hand-delivered to the Clerk of the Nairobi City County Assembly by January 14, 2021, at 5.00 pm,” reads the notice.Guyo told the Star that the committee set the date after Thursday’s court ruling.  He said Kananu's name had already been committed to the assembly last year, so the committee can proceed with the vetting.Sonko nominated Kananu on January 6, last year through a letter to former assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi.Guyo said the MCAs will strictly follow due procedure in the exercise.""We shall be looking at the qualification as per Chapter Six of the Constitution and all that the Vetting Act entails,"" he said.After vetting Kananu, the Appointment committee will prepare a report to be adopted by the assembly. (edited by o. owino)"
567,"Killers used white car, two bikes to butcher Kiambaa family","Nicholas Waruinge’s two daughters and his son are perhaps only alive because they had reported to school.On Tuesday, Waruinge, his wife, son, nephew and farmhand were murdered in cold blood at their family home.Earlier, he and his wife Anne Njenga, a nurse at Wangige Level 4 Hospital had taken their daughter Grace Karagi to Ngiriambu Girls in Kirinyaga county and her sister Joyce Njeri to St Angela Secondary School in Karura. Their eldest son had left for Mount Kenya University.Detectives told the Star the assailants trooped into Waruinge’s home that evening in a white Nissan Sunny saloon car and two motorbikes. Some of them were known to the family.The officers say the fact that they knew some of the visitors may have made Waruinge let his guard down, allowing them into their two gates.The home has a high perimeter wall, reinforced with razor wire and electric fencing.  The family had planned to install CCTV cameras on Wednesday.Once in the house, the assailants divided themselves, each group tackling a member of the family.Some stormed into Waruinge's bedroom upstairs as the others went to the kitchen where his wife and the boys were.Blood patterns in the compound show that though he had been attacked and bleeding, Waruinge ran from his bed to his elevated first-floor balcony and jumped.Forensic material collected suggests that at the fall, he injured his legs. He still tried to run to safety.""They caught up with him, overpowering him and dismembering his body at the gate,"" a detective said. Blood is splashed on the gate and at the place where the body was collected, with marks of struggle all too clear.Detectives told the Star that each of the family members was killed in the same exact way: throats slit, arms were broken and multiple stabbings.The wife's body had 16 stab wounds on the front and eight at the back. Waruinge's body bore 34 deep stab wounds.Dan Njeru, Waruinge's brother-in-law who was among those who identified the bodies, told the Star that the family is terrified.""We have cried till all our tears are exhausted,"" he said.Only two weeks ago, he said, Waruinge had hosted a large family gathering in Naivasha, bringing together almost 40 people.The home is now under tight security and homicide investigators spent the whole of Thursday combing the house for forensic evidence.Kiambu police boss Ali Nuno said they had crucial leads and ""in three days, I'll tell you who committed this heinous crime"".Waruinge worked in the United States as a nurse and returned home twice a year. He jetted into the country on December 4 to be with his family and took them to Naivasha for Christmas.Njeru said that his family hopes the police find the perpetrators ""because they appear to be people who are known"".The two sides of the family are meeting to discuss the way forward, and planning for the burial. (edited by o. owino)"
568,"Mt Kenya leaders alarmed by BBI cracks, want unity talks","President Uhuru Kenyatta's allies from Mt Kenya are strategising how to seal the widening cracks in the region and reverse apparent dwindling support for BBI.The President's confidants want all elected leaders in the region to meet and address fears that BBI isn't popular with mwananchi and could fail spectacularly without urgent intervention.It is the first time Uhuru's foot soldiers admitted there's a political problem in the President's backyard that must be fixed to foster BBI.There are reports of a major split among the handshake proponents over who should spearhead BBI campaigns in the region.Governors, said to have been tasked by the President to lead the popularisation campaign, are locked in supremacy battles with some MPs.The 2022 political interests running at cross purposes with the BBI spirit risk ruining the constitutional amendment support in Mt Kenya.On Thursday, nominated MP Maina Kamanda told the Star elected leaders from Mt Kenya are working on a strategy to build bridges and unify the region ahead of the BBI referendum.“The Mt Kenya region is united behind President Uhuru Kenyatta and will follow the direction he will show us, we want to call a meeting soon of all elected leaders to declare a common stand,” Kamanda said.The nominated MP said some leaders already have been tasked to spearhead talks among politicians pulling in opposing directions to ramp up BBI support.“Efforts are underway and soon we will bring our leaders together so we do not antagonise one another in the BBI process,” he said.Igembe North MP Maoka Maore said Mt Kenya leaders will soon address some concerns to ""build synergy.“For sure Mt Kenya supports the BBI process but some politicians' 2022 aspirations are running at cross-purposes with the BBI spirit and that shall be addressed soon,” he said.The Presidents' backyard has recently witnessed heightened opposition to the BBI process. Deputy President William Ruto's  allies claim BBI is unpopular in the region.A recent explosive letter by Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata threw a spanner in the works after he claimed BBI will suffer ""spectacular"" defeat in Mt Kenya.The claims electrified the Tangatanga brigade that has sustained an assault on the BBI process, arguing it is a Uhuru-Raila Odinga project and not a national programme to unite the country.Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange, a key BBI proponent, told the Star leaders from across region who support BBI will soon hold talks to consolidate support.""Our interest is to gather all and scatter none, we will launch a programme for leaders to talk to each other especially those supporting BBI so  we remain focused,” he said.He admitted there has been uncoordinated approach in the BBI campaigns because some politicians have been antagonising others for political reasons.“Mt Kenya people support BBI but we need to deal with BBI supporters fighting each other for political reasons,"" he said.(Edited by V.

569,Is Anne Kananu Nairobi's future governor?,"Anne Mwenda Kananu, nominated as deputy governor by Mike Sonko, just might take centre stage and avoid a polarising by-election.Kananu is the current chief officer for disaster management – fitting – and acting chief officer for water. She's an expert in criminology and forensics.Sonko nominated her as his deputy last year in January, two years after Polycarp Igathe resigned. Sonko has since been impeached and there's no deputy in place, someone who could become acting governor .Kananu, 40, was among the original chief officers who were vetted and approved by the assembly in April 2018.She has survived the constant reshuffles until November 2019, when she was named acting chief officer for water.Kananu was born in Embu county and attended St Michael Primary School in the same county from Standard 1–8. She describes her childhood as humble; she is the lastborn child.Her favourite subjects were Mathematics and Science. She once said her favourite teacher was a strict disciplinarian who taught her to do things the right way.After doing her KCPE exam, she joined Our Lady of Mercy Girls, Nagundu.In high school, her favourite subject were the sciences, especially Biology, as she enjoyed getting out in nature. Kiswahili was also a favourite. She joined the music club and played handball.After completing her secondary education, Kananu joined the University of Nairobi for a certificate in Public Relations and Human Resources.She later joined St Paul’s University for a diploma course in criminology.Kananu attended Dedan Kimathi University for a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminology and Security Management.

570,Sonko signals he could run in Nairobi by-election,"Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has sought clearance from state agencies, triggering speculations he could run in the upcoming  by-election.The High Court issued a temporary injunction barring the electoral Commission from conducting the February 18 by-election.Sonko has applied for clearance certificates from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation, the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission and the Kenya Revenue Authority. He has also sought clearance from the Higher Education Loans Board.According to documents obtained by the Star, DCI George Kinoti has, however, imposed a disclaimer on Sonko's clearance certificate, throwing his hopes into disarray.In the certificate signed by P.M Onyango for the DCI boss, Sonko has corruption and abuse of office outstanding offences.The remarks on the ex-governor's record could complicate his bid for clearance when he will present his nomination papers to the IEBC next week.Sonko is also seeking clearance from the EACC, which took him to court in a Sh357 million graft case. He has filed a personal declaration form with the commission dated December 24, 2020, as part of the requirements to get clearance from the anti-graft body.Sonko attached a tax compliance certificate from the Kenya Revenue Authority dated January 15, 2020, and which is valid until January 14, 2021.The law requires that candidates seeking election must be cleared by the EACC, the DCI, KRA, Helb and other state agencies before the IEBC accepts nomination papers.The IEBC has gazetted independent candidates and aspirants seeking party tickets for the high-stakes by-election even as a litany of legal hurdles pose a challenge for the by-election.In a fresh twist to the political crisis in Nairobi, Sonko yesterday sought to block Kananu from being vetted and approved as the deputy governor by the county assembly.However, his petition was time-barred after the court withdrew a petition by a Nairobi voter Peter Agoro challenging the nomination of Kananu.Mike sonko represented by lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui had opposed the withdrawal of the case and filed a cross-petition.Justice Hedwig Ong'undi declined to admit the petition and challenged dissatisfied parties to file an appeal.This means that Kananu's path to the county's top job is clear after Agoro's petition was withdrawn.In the petition, the ex-governor had averred that he withdrew Kananu's nomination following what he termed as “pressure from the first family”.Sonko had attached audio clips and transcripts of his conversation with a member of the first family whom he argues had proposed a different nominee.According to the documents the alleged member of the first family had suggested the name of Jane Weru instead of Kananu's as the county's deputy governor.In the new case, the former governor through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui has listed Weru and a member of the first family as interested parties. Kananu, Mutura and clerk of the assembly are listed as respondents.Following the alleged intervention, Sonko says he on December 7, 2020, before his impeachment by Senate, cancelled Kananu's nomination in a letter to speaker Benson Mutura.The assembly impeached him on December 3, 2020, while the Senate upheld his dismissal on December 17.“It's for these reasons that I formally withdraw the nomination of Ms Anne Kananu Mwenda pending the determination of the said matter and to enable me to consult Jubilee leadership and Nairobi county Assembly for a suitable replacement,” Sonko's letter received on the same date states.Sonko has also attached another conversation with Kananu where he allegedly informed her of the decision to withdraw her nomination.The former county chief has already obtained temporary orders stopping the February 18th by-election, pending the hearing and determination of a case challenging his impeachment. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
571,Why Raila faces tough options for 2022,"ODM leader Raila Odinga is walking a tightrope between tough political options ahead of next year's presidential duel.President Uhuru Kenyatta's reluctance to declare his game plan and empower the ODM leader through the complicated succession battle has further boxed Raila into a corner.An aggressive resurgence by Deputy President William Ruto and lack of a solid strategy by Uhuru's camp to counter his wave countrywide has left Raila pondering his next moves.Uhuru has maintained a studious silence even as Ruto appears to be taking over Mt Kenya, a crucial vote bloc that Raila would have relied on.Raila's former loyal strongholds in Coast and Western Kenya are slipping away as Ruto mounts a ruthless assault to position himself as the man to beat in 2022.He's putting together a coalition of lesser parties that will pack a big punch.There are jitters within Raila's camp that the Building Bridges Initiative process to amend the Constitution could prove a poisoned chalice following tremours in the President's  Mt Kenya turf. BBI support is less than solid, to put it mildly.The litany of problems has sent Raila back into the drawing board to craft an plan to buttress his grip on his backyards and penetrate new frontiers.With the President's Mt Kenya vote bloc already split down the middle, Raila faces a massive headache to counter the hustler nation wave and turn the tables in his favour.An explosive letter by Senate Majority Chief Whip  Irungu Kang'ata (Murang'a) warned President Kenyatta about a spectacular defeat of the BBI referendum in Mt Kenya, exposing Raila's fragile hopes for the region.Political analysts say Raila's think tank must come out forcefully to push Uhuru to boldly throw a spanner in the works and redeem  ODM's fortunes in Mt Kenya.Former Githunguri MP Njoroge Baiya on Thursday admitted the unfolding dynamics in Uhuru's turf poses a major danger to the handshake prospects if unchecked.The former chairman of the National Assembly's Constitution Implementation Oversight Committee said the President's backers must quickly devise a strategy to bolster the handshake.“It is urgent handshake proponents from the larger Mt Kenya region craft a wall-to-wall strategy to enhance the BBI prospects and strengthen the handshake partnership,” Baiya said.There are concerns vicious infighting among key BBI forces in the President's backyard and sustained forays by Ruto's Tangatanga brigade could have damaged the Uhuru-Raila game plan.But Kakamega Governor and ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya maintained the ODM boss remains the country's most trusted choice if he seeks the presidency.“Leave those who are making a lot of noise, go to the grassroots and see the kind of support Raila enjoys, it is overwhelming, he is not walking any tightrope,” Oparanya told the Star.The Raila' ally in Western dismissed the Tangatanga wave, insisting the handshake will produce the country's next president.“BBI guarantees the country a better future, Uhuru and Raila are working together on this and be sure no one will beat that combination,” he said.Raila's strategists have been banking  on support from the President's Mt Kenya turf to build a strong machine to vanquish Ruto's presidential prospects.There is an unspoken feeling among Ruto's supporters the BBI process had been crafted as the Special Purpose Vehicle to market Raila in Mt Kenya and deliver him to State House.Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa declared the Uhuru- Raila unity pact dead, saying it was built on quicksand with the aim of undermining Ruto and boxing him out of the succession.“The hustler nation holds the flame of the country's  future and no doubt those who thought they had cornered us are afraid because soon they will be vanquished with their BBI,” the Ruto ally said.Barasa, a vigorous Raila critic, said the Tangatanga movement has managed to turn the tables on their rivals faster than ever could have been imagined.“We have nearly 18 months to the 2022 General Election, we have our candidate and are doing everything possible to market him and prepare for the polls,” he said.Although Raila is yet to publicly declare his presidential ambitions, insisting his partnership with Uhuru is devoid of succession politics, he has warned he should not be ruled out.Having smelt the rat of suspicions and mischief regarding Mt Kenya support, Raila's party is aggressively campaigning to position itself ahead of 2022.In late January, Raila will lead all elected members of his party in a critical retreat to review the party's recent performance and develop its 2022 roadmap.Some of the ODM boss's close allies have declared the former Prime Minister will be in the ballot in 2022, opening a ferocious battlefront with the DP.However, political analysts say the former PM faces faces limited options as he seeks to manoeuvre the terrain and ward off Ruto's offensive.“The former Prime Minister must carefully inspire his traditional strongholds in Coast, Western and penetrate regions like Northeastern,"" analyst Lawrence Mutua said.Mutua said Raila must leave his comfort zone and systematically develop a watertight plan to both enhance his 2022 presidential chances and redeem the party's image.“The ODM party has been battling image issues for many years, it is only 17 months to the general election yet we see no  aggressive campaign to restore confidence in its structures,” the diplomacy lecturer said.ODM's Coast popularity faces a formidable challenge from Ruto's Tangatanga movement and threats by some leaders to form a regional party.Two weeks ago, Ruto stormed Kwale county in victory lap and pledged his hustler movement will take over the Coast.Formation a Coast regional party is part of Ruto's scheme to reverse Raila's fortunes as he penetrates the ODM leader's traditional bastions.The spirited efforts to craft a strong Coastal party will jolt the ODM family and disorder Raila's hopes of maintaining a strong grip on the crucial region.Raila's key Coast region point man, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, has dismissed Ruto's plan to take over the Coast, saying he wants to divide the people for selfish interests.“Formation of a new party will only divide  people further and undermine the unity the region has enjoyed in ODM. This has enabled us to push our agenda as a united region on the national stage,” Joho said, telling off Ruto.The ODM deputy party leader warned  Ruto's allies elected on the ODM ticket to be ready to resign and seek fresh mandates if they are strong enough.“Kenya and the Coast will not progress through fraud and lies. We need honest and principled leadership,"" Joho said.Ruto's Coast allies maintain they have vanquished Raila from the region.Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, who is Ruto's key Coast ally, told the Star the hustler nation has devised a strategy they will soon use to ""annihilate"" ODM.“The hustler nation is unstoppable. In coming months Kenyans are going to get a glimpse of the DP's plan to completely vanquish Raila from the Coast,"" she said without elaborating.Tangatanga's decisive win in the Msambweni by-election through the DP- backed independent candidate Faisal Bader appears to have given the hustler nation fresh mojo to take on Raila.The win has been interpreted by Tangatanga as a major blow to the handshake train as well as a warning shot to Uhuru and Raila that the DP remains a formidable force.In Western Kenya, Raila faces a litmus test in the Matungu by-election as Ruto seeks to assert his authority and win support following his massive incursions in recent months.The Matungu by-election in March, just like the Msambweni poll, is tipped to be a major battle pitting Raila against Ruto in the battle for the Western vote bloc intensifies.“Raila is just a paper tiger in Western, we are going to mobilise the hustler nation as never before to completely annihilate Raila's hopes to win our Luhya nation,"" former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale said.The Tangatanga brigade is said to be sponsoring an opinion poll in Matungu constituency to pick the most popular candidate."
572,"Mudavadi, Kalonzo and Wetang'ula plot new alliance for 2022","Three top politicians - old pals from Nasa - have hinted at a new political alliance providing a third alternative ahead of next year's election. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang'ula  reportedly are working on their own alliance – Nasa less ODM's Raila Odinga – that will support one presidential candidate. Already Deputy President William Ruto is building his own coalition of smaller parties, while Raila is expected to team up with President Uhuru Kenyatta's allies in another coalition.This arrangement could rattle Raila and Ruto—seen as front runners.And as they pledged to work together, Muhoho Kenyatta, the younger brother of President Kenyatta suggested that united Luhyas could give Mudavadi the presidency.Speaking during a memorial service for Mudavadi’s mother, Hannah Atsianzale, at Friends International Centre in Nairobi, Muhoho said togetherness of the community would result in greater political roles in the country.“Togetherness of the community could lead to much greater roles and development not only at home, but in the country as a whole,” he said.Western politicians at the service had made passionate pleas for Luhya unity and pledged to rally behind Mudavadi in his 2022 presidential bid.Kalonzo singled out Raila for bolting out from Nasa, signalling the simmering disquiet among the trio.According to the National Super 2Alliance (Nasa) agreement, ODM was not to field a presidential candidate in 2022 if the party had won the 2017 polls.“With our brother Mudavadi, Weta and our brother Raila we formed Nasa. But some of our friends have a difficulty with that organisation. But the three of us have decided to work together come rain come shower,” Kalonzo declared.He went on, “I assure you my brother. Musalia, I have walked the journey with you. You have walked with me. Weta, we have walked together. I give you my pledge that we will walk this journey together come rain or shower. No matter the obstacles, and I mean it.”In his speech, Wetang'ula also revealed they had a covenant not to go their different ways in 2022.“My brother, Musalia, we took a solemn promise to each other that we shall walk together,” the senator told the mourners.There have been telltale signs that Musalia and Wetangula are determined to ring-fence the Western region from political raids by opponents.They  have a deal, for instance, not to field antagonistic candidates in the upcoming Kabuchai and Matungu parliamentary by-elections.But political analyst Advice Mundalo said the togetherness of the three could be a unity of convenience meant to improve their political relevance.He explained that the three cannot face off with Ruto and Raila in their individual capacities.“The unity of the three will be tested when they will need to cooperate behind a single individual for a contest. That could be their point of disintegration,” Mundalo told the Star.He said the three need to focus on making strategic decisions or else they will play subordinates to Ruto and Raila.Signals that something was in the works started on December 14 when Mudavadi, Kalonzo and Wetang’ula met in Nairobi's Karen for private discussions.Ten days later, the three met again at Stoni Athi Resort in Machakos county were they were joined by Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu.The three fell out with Raila after they failed to attend his swearing-in  ceremony at Uhuru Park on January 30, 2018.ODM stalwarts called them cowards and asked that Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho should replace Kalonzo as Raila’s number two in the Nasa arrangementDuring the Thursday service, Muhoho said he was passing his condolence message on behalf of the Kenyatta family.He said the two family’s have a long history of friendship.President Kenyatta himself has been a close Mudavadi friend.In the 2013 contest, Uhuru agreed to back Mudavadi for the top job only to change days later and claim he was misled by “mademoni”.Mudavadi in his autobiography Soaring above the Storms of Passion said Uhuru and Ruto visited his home and told him they wished to pull out of the poll because of the crimes against humanity charges they were facing at the ICC.During the service, leaders from Western region said they will rally the Luhya community to back Mudavadi’s candidature.Vihiga Senator George Khaniri said Mudavadi’s popularity has demonstrated by the way leaders took their time to mourn with him following the death of his mother.“I have never seen the leadership of the country so united to mourn with a person. As a community in Western, we want to unite and speak with one voice,” he said.However, Ruto, who also attended the service, said what matters was the unity of the country.“I agree with those calling for unity of the community. We should however remember that as we talk about the unity of the community, the togetherness of the nation as a whole is most imperative,” he stated.Makadara MP George Aladwa said they will also be mobilising the Luhya community in Nairobi to speak with one voice.“We will be respected if we are united. We want to head to the 2022 polls as a team,” he added.Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said the Luhya community has been a laughing stock because its people are always divided during elections.Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe said it was time the community in Western united behind Mudavadi. “When we unite behind Mudavadi, then he will have high bargaining power come 2022,” said Wangwe, who is the Jubilee Chief Whip in the National Assembly.CS Wamalwa said the Luhya people should embrace other communities even as they unite. “We should embrace unity in diversity. Leaders who have spoken should mean what they say and say what they mean,” he stated.Other leaders present included National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, Cabinet secretaries Eugene Wamalwa and Mutahi Kagwe, legislators Tindi Mwale, Christopher Aseka, Godffrey Osotsi, Tim Wanyonyi, Beatrice Adagala, Victor Munyaka, Vincent Kawaya, Ferdinand Wanyonyi, Ayub Savula, Omboko Milemba, Esther Passaris, Caleb Amisi, George Khaniri and Sakwa Bunyasi.Others were former MPs Cyrus Jirongo, Andrew Ligale and Ruben Ndolo.(Edited by V.

573,Court orders man missing over 26 years presumed dead,"The High Court has declared a man who went missing 26 years ago from his Kisii home presumed dead to allow his siblings to go on with succession of the family estate. Justice R. Ougo on December 18, 2020, directed the Registrar of Births and Deaths to issue a certificate of death for John Nyamasege Amenya. ""I hereby declare that John Nyamasege Amenya alias Nyamasege Amenya is presumed dead and direct the Registrar of Births and Deaths to issue a certificate of death in respect of Nyamasege,"" the judge ruled. Charles Kiage Amenya, brother of Nyamasege, had presented his petition seeking a declaration that Nyamasege be presumed dead. He also urged the court to direct the Registrar of Births and Deaths to issue a certificate of death in respect of his missing brother. Amenya argued that he is the firstborn of his late father Amenya Obiero who died in 1980 and his mother Peris Amenya, who died in 2000. He said he has six brothers and two sisters. Nyamasege, was the sixth born in their family. On or about 1994 his brother left for an unknown destination and did not tell him or any family member where he was going.Amenya said he reported the matter at Kisii police station the year his brother went missing. He also inquired from all their relatives whether they had seen Nyamasege.  None had seen or heard from him.He said they searched for his brother in hospitals and mortuaries and made reports to assistant chiefs, chiefs, DOs and DCs in Kisii and Nyamira but did not find him or hear of his whereabouts.On October 2, 2020, Amenya went back to Kisii police station to look for the Occurrence Book extract he had been issued in the year 1994 but was advised to make a new report because the station destroys its Occurrence Books every 10 years. He made a new report and acquired OB No. 37/02/10/2020. Amenya further said he had published a missing person notice in a local daily on  October 27, 2020, but he was never contacted with information on the whereabouts of his brother. He urged the court to grant the application as soon as it could to facilitate the finalisation of a succession cause in respect of his father’s estate.The court found that the applicant had demonstrated through evidence that since early 1994, he had not heard or seen his brother. In the circumstances, the judge found that there was sufficient evidence to sustain a presumption of death of Nyamasege."
574,Police given time to produce probe reports on Kabaka death,"A high school teacher who was held but later released over the illness of the late Machakos Senator Boniface Kabaka will on January 28 know if the court will exonerate her.On Thursday, the prosecution told senior resident magistrate David Ndungi that a report from the Government Chemist was not ready. A report from cybercrime was also not ready. ""We are seeking more time to complete all our investigations since a medical report from the hospital has not been furnished to the investigating officer,"" the prosecution said. Esther Nthenya Muli, through lawyer Dan Maanzo, did not oppose the prosecution’s application.Ndungi directed the case to be mentioned on January 28 to confirm whether the reports will be ready. Nthenya, 45, was arrested in early December 2020 and detained pending investigations. She was freed on a personal bond. Nthenya, the deputy principal at Mathemba Secondary School in Makueni county, was detained as police investigated an attempted murder claim, but she was released after the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ruled out any criminal charges. The prosecution told the court that Senator Kabaka had driven himself to the apartment-hotel in Kilimani on the Elgeyo Marakwet Road in the afternoon.He booked a room where Nthenya joined him at about 3pm.The court heard the senator had looked well when he checked in and ordered food and drinks.The magistrate said, ""It is necessary to detain the woman who was with the politician at 3Dee Apartments for a while to see if the senator would improve.”The court was told the politician collapsed after he was joined by Nthenya. Food and drinks were served by the staff.The senator was rushed by an ambulance to Nairobi Hospital where he was admitted to the ICU. Surgery was performed on December 4, 2020, but he later died."
575,Concern over more bodies dumped in Naivasha,"At least three persons have been murdered and their bodies dumped along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road in the last one month.The body of a man was found dumped near Mt Longonot National Park, with indications that he was strangled.The body had a rope around the neck and was found by residents who first thought it was a suicide before police suggested otherwise.Late last month, a body with head injuries was found near the area dumpsite and a week later another was discovered near Mirera area with indications the victim had been strangled.According to Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru, a report of suicide was made to the police but on inquiry it emerged that this had been staged-managed.Waweru noted that the deceased was killed elsewhere and the body ferried to the scene where members of the public spotted it.“We have collected the fingerprints and sent them to the Registrar of Persons for identification while the body is lying at the local morgue,” he said on Thursday.The police boss added that they were investigating the rising cases of bodies being dumped along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road by unknown people.“The area between Naivasha and Mai Mahiu is sparsely populated, making it easier for those involved in this crime to dump the bodies without anyone seeing them,” he said.Residents of Jikaze IDP camp along the road expressed their concern over an increase in the number of bodies dumped in the area in the last two years.They noted that the majority of the victims were middle-aged men who were killed through strangulation using ropes.One of the IDPs, James Mburu, noted that the bodies were always dumped late in the night or very early in the morning.“We are now worried when we see unmarked cars driving off the highway as they have contributed to the number of dumped bodies,” he said.Early last year, two bodies of drivers who had been hired in Mlolongo and Kikuyu to ferry goods in two different incidents were found dumped in the area and their vehicles missing."
576,Killer gorge in Hell's Gate to reopen soon,"After a 16-month closure, the spectacular killer gorge in Hell's Gate National Park – where seven people died in a flash flood – will soon reopen.Kenya Wildlife officials said on Thursday it would reopen in a couple of weeks, but the exact date was not given.A family of six and their tour guide were swept away on September 1, 2019, after heavy rains in nearby hills. There were no weather alerts, sirens or emergency exits for their escape.The bodies of the seven, including two minors, were found 30km from the gorge.The gorge was closed indefinitely.Alerts, sirens and exit routes have been installed. Sirens will warn visitors of bad weather in advance.KWS Central Rift assistant director Dickson Ritan said on Thursday the gorge would open in a couple of weeks after all safety measures were in place and tested.Ritan said funds had been released to released for safety measures.“We are keen on several escape exits in the gorge and we shall address the issue of early warning systems within the park,” he said.The gorge is one of the most-visited spots in the park.“Once it's operational, the gorge will be better and safer for our visitors as we are keen to fully address safety,” he said.Maasai community leader Jackson ole Senchu said closure of the gorge had cost about 100 tour guides and traders their jobs.""Closure of the gorge was a major blow to the community as tens of our youths were employed as guides and women sold beadwork and trinkets,"" he said.He said the community fully supported the safety measures and said everyone had been shaken by the deaths.(Edited by V.

577,It's back to square one as clinicians strike again,"It's almost back to square one in the healthcare crisis afflicting the country.Most nurses walked off the job on December 7. They are still out.They were joined by clinicians, doctors and now lab technicians. Most doctors settled but other health staff are still absent or on go-slow.Clinicians say the Council of Governors hasn't signed their return-to-work agreement.And less than a week after calling off their strike, clinical officers have resumed work boycott again after failing to reach an agreement on the signing of their return-to-work formula.The clinicians' union has been battling with the Council of Governors after the county bosses backed out of the agreement, barely a week after ordering members to resume duty.On Tuesday, the union gave the government 48 hours to ensure the agreement is signed in full, otherwise they walk out again.The ultimatum lapsed on Thursday.The clinical officers had called off their strike on January 1 but now claim the agreement is yet to be fully signed. The CoG was supposed to sign the document on Monday but failed to do so.“We haven’t moved yet, they are still promising but nothing substantive yet, we have no option,” Kenya Union of Clinical Officers secretary general George Gibore said.“When you ask someone to climb up a tree then you cut the tree, the tree for the clinical officers to go back to work has been cut down so we go back to the starting point,” he added.The union has accused the CoG of being insincere and unrealistic by saying that the return-to-work formula be signed at individual counties yet acknowledge the ongoing conciliation at the Labour ministry.“We know the language they understand best, and we are more than ready to speak that language. We have the energy, we have the zeal and we have the psyche to engage them through that language,"" Gibore said.Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako said no agreement has been reached with the nurses union either.Though he didn't elaborate, reports indicate the decision by the COG to backtrack on its agreement contributed to the nurses union backing away.The nurses have been on strike since December 7. Early this week, the union was optimistic that a solution  would be reached before the end of the week, which now seems to be a pipe dream.Panyako said only nurses in counties that have met their demands will be allowed to resume duty.“We want to be told those nurses who have died when the medical cover is not in place, what happens to them? What about those nurses who are admitted in hospital, they have died and we have contributed to pay their medical bills?""We want those monies we have paid  those hospitals refunded and given to the families left behind.”So far, 34 nurses, 13 doctors and nine clinical officers have died of Covid-19, with at least 3,050 having been infected while on duty.The CoG on Monday bolted out of the return-to-work formula signed by the doctors' union claiming the counties have no money to implement the agreement.The Council of Governors on Monday said the issues raised in the RTWF have huge monetary implication that have neither been factored into the current budget nor the forthcoming financial year budget.They said a special conditional grant must be allocated to each county to implement the demands.On Wednesday, lab technologists joined in the strike over similar grievances: lack of personal protective equipment, hiring of more officers, demanding for risk allowance and delay of payment of their members in some counties.(Edited by V.

578,Kemu triples fees for state-sponsored students,"Kenya Methodist University has become the first institution to officially triple fees paid by government-sponsored students.A proposal to increase fees for government-sponsored students has yet to get approval of the government.A school fees structure seen by the Star shows Pharmacy students will now pay Sh54,000 per semester up from the previous Sh20,500.Already, an uproar by students has pushed the student council to call for withdrawal of the fee increment to make room for consultations.Peter Onyango, the student council chairperson, in a letter to students said: “This is to inform you that the student council has heard the great outpour and outcry on the issue of fee increment unilaterally carried out by the administration and is working tirelessly to resolve the matter before the reporting date.” The concern has also been raised by the Kenya Universities Student Organisation.In a letter, William Onkoba, the KUSO academic affairs secretary said: “It has been brought to my attention the purported triple increase in fees for all the government students in the university… I, therefore, request that the increment be terminated with immediate effect and proper communication be made to comrades,” the letter reads.The letter was copied to the Education ministry, other KUSO officials and the students.Kemu  vice chancellor David Gichoya on Wednesday told the Star the institution would respond to the matter.The proposal to increase university fees has been an on and off debate since 2019 but gained momentum after receiving major backing from the Education ministry, the Treasury and a section of legislators.However, proposed implementation will start with new students, the 2019 KCSE candidates who qualified for university places.The proposal is now set to be fronted to President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Cabinet this month for consideration.The Education ministry will be responsible for drafting the Cabinet proposal for the fee increment, among other issues. It seeks to find a remedy for the dwindling financial health of public universities.The university bosses argue that the college cost has been on a mostly upward trend for the last two decades. However, the fees have remained at a constant Sh16,000 for the last 30 years. In addition to high tuition prices, paying for housing, food, transportation, books, and other school-related fees add to college expenses.While reading the 2019 national budget, then-Treasury CS Henry Rotich hinted at a possible increase of fees in the institutions of higher learning. He noted that this would be necessary to address the funding challenges faced the institutions."
579,"IEBC, anti-graft agency barred from commenting on Waititu case","The electoral and the anti-graft agencies have been barred from commenting on the merits of former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu’s case.This is after Waititu's lawyer, John Swaka, told the court that both the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission had been commenting on whether the former governor can vie in an election even though his case is yet to be determined.In the case, Waititu moved to court on Thursday last week challenging IEBC’s decision to bar him from contending in the Nairobi gubernatorial by-election.He wants the IEBC to accept his candidature to vie in the upcoming Nairobi by-election.The Nairobi governor's seat fell vacant following the impeachment of Mike Sonko last month. Justice Antony Mrima on Thursday directed all parties in the case to act with restraint by ensuring that the proceedings before the court are not discussed outside the jurisdiction of the court.""I direct the lawyers in this matter to advise their clients to respect the doctrine of sub judice,"" the judge said.Judge Mrima further directed the IEBC and the EACC to file their responses to the petition filed by Waititu in court.The case will be mentioned on February 1 for further directions.On December 30, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said Waititu cannot vie for the seat because he had been impeached.Waititu claims that the actions by the IEBC to bar him amounts to denial of his political rights and denial of the right to a fair trial which is guaranteed under the Constitution.“I will continue to suffer without the intervention of this honourable court which ought to look at the process that was both illegal and procedural leading to the decision that has been stated by the first respondent (IEBC),” reads court papers.He has accused the two agencies of engaging in a smear campaign against him by convicting him when the case is still in court.The former governor argued that though he faces a corruption case he has not been convicted of any offence by any court and as such he has the right to vie for the gubernatorial election.“As it stands, I have not been convicted of any crime and have fully complied with all electoral guidelines provided when running for the aforementioned electoral position,” reads court papers.Waititu also said that on the issue of impeachment he has appealed and it’s still pending in court."
580,"Magoha doubles down on under-tree classes, says they add oxygen","Education CS George Magoha has again said learning under trees is best for students and asked Kenyans to stop ridiculing those using them.“For those children who are concerned, the best classroom is under a tree. And the reason is very simple. Trees add oxygen to the air and take away carbon dioxide,” he said.Many learners have been forced to study under trees due to congested classrooms unfit for social distancing to control the spread of the coronavirus. Kenyans have asked why the ministry could not build more classes during the nine-month Covid-19 holiday.But during a visit at Oloolua Primary School in Ngong, Kajiado county Magoha reiterated his December 30 directive for teachers to uses tree shades for classes.The school has nearly 2,000 pupils and since its reopening on Monday, has enrolled an additional 320 learners.Head teacher Irene Gakii said the numbers are likely to rise. She said each class has more than 100 pupils.Magoha was accompanied by CSs Fred Matiang'i (Interior), James Macharia (Transport), Najib Balala (Tourism and Wildlife), Amina Mohamed (Sports), Keriako Tobiko (Environment), Simon Chelugui (Labour) and Joseph Mucheru (ICT).Magoha urged teachers to be innovative in the use of Sh18.4 billion school fund released on Tuesday.Tobiko said he will work with the Education ministry towards the greening of schools.The team contributed building materials for expanding of classrooms, providing foodstuff and other amenities to allow learners, most of whom come from vulnerable households, to stay in school.Matiang’i said the government will conclude rehabilitation of the school's borehole in a week to ensure efficient supply of water. (edited by o. owino)"
581,Voter withdraws case halting Kananu's vetting,"An anti-corruption court has allowed Nairobi voter Peter Agoro to withdraw a case that halted the vetting of deputy governor nominee Ann Kananu.It is not clear in law whether Kananu’s vetting for the position can proceed as her appointee, impeached Governor Mike Sonko, is no longer in office.The nomination process ends with the formal appointment by appointive authority, in this case Sonko.But if Kananu is cleared by the assembly, she could effectively take over the remainder of Sonko’s term. Speaker Benson Mutura is holding the office in acting capacity for 60 days.The office of the deputy governor fell vacant on January 12, 2018 when Polycarp Igathe resigned.After a year working without a deputy, Sonko nominated Kananu – the chief officer in charge of Disaster Management and Coordination – for the role. He had just been charged in a Sh357 million graft case.In his suit, Agoro argued that Kananu’s nomination breached orders issued by the anti-corruption court barring Sonko from his office pending the graft case. Agoro received orders stopping the vetting in the assembly.On Monday, Agoro filed a notice with the court declaring his intentions to withdraw the case.Justice Hedwig Ong’udi formally withdrew the petition on Thursday.Ong’udi said Agoro filed the petition as an individual and showed nowhere in his pleadings that he had been representing other persons.She also dismissed claims that Agoro was under pressure to withdraw the case as without basis and evidence.The judge said Paul Musyimi, who had asked to be enjoined in the matter as a co-petitioner, had not done so since January last year.Ong’udi said that Agoro cannot be forced to go on with the case since he has no interest in pursuing it any further.Meanwhile, there seems to be no clear position on the resignation of Igathe as it was not communicated to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission as required by law. It was also not gazetted.Consequently, Nairobi voter Patrick Kiiru has since filed a case in court seeking an interpretation of the matter.In his petition, Kiiru says Igathe ought to have assumed office after Sonko was impeached by the assembly. Nairobi assembly’s Majority Chief Whip Paul Kaguathi has also filed an affidavit saying IEBC communicated in January last year that it was unaware of a vacancy in the office of the deputy governor. Article 182 of the Constitution provides that a resignation by the governor or his deputy should be communicated in writing to the speaker of the count assembly.   The court was also notified of a cross-petition filed by Sonko’s lawyers.In the cross-petition, Sonko sought to have the court stop the assembly from vetting or approving Kananu as deputy governor.Also sought was an order prohibiting Benson Mutura from holding himself as the substantive governor of Nairobi.Ong’udi said she cannot deal with a matter that has yet to be placed before her.She directed parties in the case to file an appeal if they are dissatisfied with her ruling withdrawing the main petition. (edited by o. owino)"
582,Covid-19 positivity rate shoots to 6 per cent,"The positivity rate for Covid-19 cases rose to 6.17 per cent Thursday after nearly a week below five per cent.The rate was 4.6 per cent on Wednesday, four per cent on Tuesday, and 3.19 per cent on Monday.The Ministry of Health had warned of a possible surge in numbers in January following expected gatherings over the festive period.Health CS Mutahi Kagwe urged county governments to keep high levels of preparedness to avert a new wave. “… we must anticipate any situation and therefore that is why we have asked that the preparations for all sorts of isolation facilities in counties are all put in place just in the event of anything like that happening,” Kagwe said.On Thursday, 335 of 5,424 samples tested turned positive results in 24 hours, up from 271 on Wednesday, 219 on Tuesday and just 106 on Monday. The virus caseload is 97,733 from 1,075,673 tests.Eight more people died, pushing the toll to 1,702.In a statement, Kagwe reported that 340 patients had recovered from the disease – 261 at home and 79 in hospital.  Some 80,306 people have recovered from the virus since March.“Currently, there are 536 patients admitted in various health facilities countrywide and 2,498 on home based isolation and care. 29 patients are in the intensive care unit, 18 of whom are on ventilator support and nine on supplemental oxygen while two are on observation,” Kagwe said.The CS said that 10 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen in the general wards.Nairobi recorded 102 new cases followed by Meru with 46, Makueni with 40, Nyeri with 19, kajiado with 14, Embu with 13, Mombasa with 12 and Kiambu with 11.Nakuru, Nyandarua, Migori and Busia each recorded nine new cases; Samburu eight; Kirinyaga six; Machakos five; Kitui, Laikipia, Uasin Gishu and Siaya three cases each; Kilifi recorded two cases; while Narok, Murang’a and Taita Taveta each had one case.(edited by o. owino)"
583,African scientists explain how the continent has beaten Covid-19,"African scientists have said the continent has so far managed to buck the Covid-19 doomsday predictions. as cases represent just about 3.6 per cent of total global cases, while fatalities are much lower.In a new analysis, the Africa CDC speculates that some people have pre-existing immunity to the coronavirus.Scientists had early last year predicted Africa and South East Asia would be hard hit because of their weak health systems, shortage in human resources, and challenges posed by existing endemic diseases.In the analysis published by Science journal, Africa CDC director John Nkengasong says the continent’s much younger population and relatively warmer climate could also have helped.“The puzzle of the Covid-19 pandemic in Africa can partly be explained by decisive measures taken early to prepare the continent,” Nkengasong explains further, in the article co-authored by Justin Maeda, the acting head of surveillance and disease intelligence at the Africa CDC.The two say the continent reacted in a timely and collective manner once the first cases were reported in Egypt on February 14.“However, more data is needed to understand the different pieces of the puzzle that contribute to the pattern of the pandemic in Africa,” the authors say.Young people are less susceptible to severe disease and, for instance, Kenya has a median age of 20, compared with 47 in Italy.This view is supported by head of the Kemri–Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Nairobi Edwine Barasa, who sees a clear link between demographic and how Covid-19 plays out.That is, “pretty much the only factor where there is clear evidence,” Barasa says in a separate interview with Science.He says other possible factors, such as climate, genetics, or immunity due to previous exposure to other pathogens, have not yet been fully investigated.Africa CDC also credits the decisive and timely response by African people.On February 22, all African ministers of health met in Addis Ababa and adopted a joint continental strategy to limit transmission, limit deaths, and limit social and economic harms and impacts on other endemic diseases.After that countries like Kenya shut down early, enforced masking and curfews to date. While the measures devastated the economy, they also bought time for the country to sensitise people and upgrade health facilities.In Kenya, the virus caseload hit 97,398  last Wednesday after 271 more patients tested positive from a sample of 5,830 tested in 24 hours. This represents a positivity rate of 4.6 per cent.By Wednesday, cumulative fatalities stood at 1,694 while total recoveries were  79,966.Kenya is now waiting for the supply of 24 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine from the Covax facility.Gavi told the Star they will start shipping the AstraZeneca vaccine around the world by the end of March. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
584,Church leaders fault state obsession with BBI,"The NCCK on Thursday faulted the government for concentrating too much on the Building Bridges Initiative and failing to address problems affecting the Kenyan people.The National Council of Churches of Kenya asked the government to concentrate on education, health and 2022 General Elections, replacing electoral commissioners who quit.Secretary general Chris Kinyanjui said the government has focused too much on the BBI and failed to address issues regarding the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.He spoke at Jumuiya Country and Conference Home in Kabuku in Limuru, where he also asked church leaders to involve youth, women and people living with disabilities in its leadership.Kinyanjui said the council is asking the government to replace those commissioners who resigned and appoint others.He also asked the government to audit the electoral process so that it can identify gaps that led to previous shortcomings.""The government should review the voters register and finally, pass and implement electoral related laws"" Kinyanjui said.He said said these resolved issues will lead to free, fair, peaceful and credible elections in 2022.""If we act on these needs, then there will indeed be hope that the 2022 elections will be free, fair, peaceful and credible"" Kinyanjui said.He said the council is concerned that pupils and students are overcrowding in classrooms while others are learning under trees and others in open fields.Kinyanjui said they have asked churches under the council to offer their churches, halls and other facilities to be used by neighbouring schools as classrooms.The secretary general also asked county and national governments to address health issues raised by striking health workers.He said those who suffer are Kenyans, who do not need to know if you are a doctor, a nurse, a medical officer or a lab technician but they want to be treated.He was accompanied by the NCCK executive committee members, to give their state of the nation address.(Edited by V.

You cannot support Musalia if you are in Jubilee or ODM, let us be honest,"" Malala said, leaving mourners in stitches.""If you want to support Musalia Mudavadi genuinely, join ANC and I'm sure we will propel this leader to greater heights.More to follow..."

591,Petition challenging Anne Kananu's nomination as Nairobi DG withdrawn,"An anti corruption court has formally withdrawn a petition filed by a Nairobi voter - Peter Agoro -challenging the nomination of Anne Kananu as Nairobi's Deputy Governor.Impeached Governor Mike Sonko represented by lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui had opposed the withdrawal of the case and subsequently filed a cross-petition. But Justice Hedwig Ongundi on Thursday said the alleged petition has not been paid for and it is not before her so she cannot make any directions.Kinyanjui said Sonko is entitled to access justice.He called for a stay of the court's decision withdrawing petition.However, Ong'undi declined to suspend her ruling. She said any party that is dissatisfied with her ruling should proceed to the appellate court. She insisted that her reason for withdrawal is that no public interest will be suffered as Agoro did not mention anywhere in his papers that he has been representing other persons. She also dismissed claims of Agoro being under pressure to withdraw the case. No material was placed before court to prove the same. She said Agoro cannot be forced to go on with a petition he no longer wishes to pursue. So she subsequently withdrew it.The likelihood of a by-election taking place seems to be fading and Nairobians might just be spared a gruelling political duel.The February 18 by-election was suspended by the High Court on Monday—the first major hurdle—until a petition filed by Sonko is determined.With the withdrawal of the petition, Kananu could be hastily vetted by the county assembly and sworn in as the deputy governor.She would then take over as the first woman governor of Nairobi.Kananu, a criminology graduate, served as Disaster Management chief officer in Sonko's administration.Sources told the Star that influential individuals in the establishment have drawn an elaborate plan to have Kananu take over and avert a divisive by-election.Some city MCAs have confirmed that they were on standby to vet Kananu and pave her path to power.“Unless the court decides otherwise, the committee will go ahead and vet her, proceed to report writing and present it to the assembly for the house to either reject or accept her as the deputy governor,” said a second-term MCA and a member of the county assembly Appointment committee.The committee is chaired by the speaker, with the Majority leader as the vice-chairperson.On Monday, petitioner Peter Odhiambo Agoro filed a notice to withdraw the case challenging the nomination of Kananu. Agoro had secured orders barring her vetting until his case is heard and determined.He argued that Sonko had violated court orders by making the nomination since at the time, Anti-Corruption Court magistrate Douglas Ogoti had barred the governor from accessing office after he was charged for graft."
592,"Court bars IEBC, anti-graft agency from commenting on Waititu case","The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the EACC have been barred from commenting on the merits of former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu’s case.This is after his lawyer John Swaka told the court that both EACC and IEBC had been commenting on whether Waititu can vie in an election even though the case is yet to be determined.In the case, Waititu moved to court on Thursday last week challenging IEBC’s decision to bar him from contesting in the Nairobi gubernatorial by-election.Justice Antony Mrima on Thursday directed all parties in the case to act with restraint by ensuring that the proceedings before court are not discussed outside the jurisdiction of the court.""I direct the lawyers in this matter to advise their clients to respect doctrine of subjudice,"" the judge said.The case will be mentioned on February 1 for further directions.On Wednesday, Waititu received a reprieve in his quest to succeed Mike Sonko as the next Nairobi Governor.This is after the IEBC published his name among 12 independent candidates seeking to battle it out to take charge at City Hall.Waititu, well known as Babayao had earlier challenged a decision by the electoral commission barring him from running in the Nairobi governor by-election.Waititu faulted IEBC's decision saying though he faces a corruption case, he has not been convicted of any offence and as such he has the right to vie for governor.“As it stands, the applicant in this matter has not been convicted of any crime and has fully complied with all electoral guidelines provided when running for the aforementioned electoral position,” the court was told.Waititu was impeached as governor of Kiambu county in 2020 but has since expressed interest in contesting for the Nairobi county seat in the forthcoming election, which has been suspended pending a case filed by Sonko.The Nairobi office became vacant following the impeachment of Sonko.Waititu's political career seemed to have taken a wrong turn after EACC seemingly locked him out from holding any public office in the future.In a statement last month, EACC said all persons offering themselves as independent candidates or seeking party nominations for election must meet the integrity threshold under Chapter 6 of the Constitution.""The commission considers a person is disqualified from holding public office if the person has as been dismissed or otherwise removed from office for contravention of Chapter 6 of the Constitution or its enabling legislation, in accordance with Article 75(3) of the Constitution,"" EACC said.CEO Twalib Mbarak said a person is also disqualified if found, in accordance with any law, to have misused or abused a state office or public office or in any way to have contravened Chapter 6 as contemplated under Articles 99(2)(h) and 193(2)(g)."

595,Man decapitated in gory murder of Kiambu family,"If Nicholas Waruinge had known last year that he would be brutally butchered in his Kiambu home, he would have remained in the United States where he worked as a nurse.He jetted into the country on December 4 to reunite with his family in Kiambaa, but on Wednesday, police collected his decapitated body from his home. He was murdered alongside his wife, their son, a nephew and a farmhand.So mutilated were the bodies that the intestines were hanging out and there was blood all over the place. The scene was so gory that even the closest relatives were not allowed by the police to view the bodies.His murdered wife worked as a nurse at Wangige Hospital. Kiambu county police commander Ali Nuhu said Waruinge’s body had over 36 stab wounds, which appeared to have been inflicted using a heavy excavation digging bar (tarimbo).His home is well-secured with a perimeter wall reinforced by razor wires and a double layer of strong gates. “We have not witnessed this kind of crime in the area for at least 10 years. It was not robbery because nothing appears to have been taken away,” Nuhu said.The assailants gained access into the compound, executed the family members one after another and then took off without being noticed.But it emerged that before the four were murdered, the assailants had first killed a farmhand just outside the compound.Neighbours said they did not even hear a cry for help from the family? It is not clear, and even if they even tried, no one would hear because it is far withdrawn from the rest of the villagers.Highly placed investigators told the Star that the family members are the first suspects in the crime.""The way this home is guarded, it is clear that there are issues in this family. We are treating them as among the suspects,"" the source said.To tie up the loose ends in the story, detectives are also pursuing a theory of family wrangles that could have cost Waruinge and his children and wife their lives.It emerged that one of Waruinge's brother had been mysteriously murdered in 2016 by unknown people.Another was shot in the hip while driving home in 2019. Further, the detectives say, Waruinge was a polygamous man and there existed sharp rivalry between his first and second family.The bodies were taken to KU mortuary."

A US Air Force veteran, she is thought to have been shot after entering the building alongside other rioters.US broadcaster Fox5 spoke to the woman's mother-in-law who said Babbitt had been a Trump supporter.She is thought to have been shot at around 15:00 Washington time, and was rushed to hospital but later pronounced dead.The mayor of the US capital city has extended a public emergency for 15 days until after inauguration day.""Many persons came to the District armed and for the purpose of engaging in violence and destruction and have engaged in violence and destruction. They have fired chemical irritants, bricks, bottles and guns,"" Mayor Muriel Bowser said.""Their motivation is ongoing.""The declaration will allow the city to draw upon additional resources to protect residents, like enforcing curfews, expanding emergency services or distributing necessities.The order lasts until 15:00 on 21 January, the day after Biden will be sworn in.The city is already under curfew declared by the mayor from 18:00 on Wednesday to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT), though dozens of people have been arrested for violating the order.At the moment, we're watching as lawmakers continue the process of certifying the Electoral College vote from the states.

600,Pending complaints can’t stop me from acting as CJ - Mwilu,"Corruption and abuse of office complaints before the Judicial Service Commission cannot stop me from acting as Chief Justice, Deputy CJ Philomena Mwilu has told a court.  Mwilu told Justice Anthony Mrima that a judge’s integrity does not diminish or end nor does she stop serving on account of pending complaints for her removal.Through her lawyers Nelson Havi and Julie Soweto she said her case cannot be any different. The Deputy Chief Justice was responding to a suit filed by activist Okiya Omtatah to stop her from taking over from David Maraga when he retires on January 12.Omtatah wants Mwilu to wait until the JSC clears her of allegations of corruption and abuse of office.On Wednesday, Mwilu told the court that the JSC does not appoint an acting Chief Justice. It cannot be prohibited from undertaking a function not given to it. The JSC is a party to the suit but has yet to file nor respond to the case.“It is not in the public interest for the Kenyan public to be denied the benefit of the administrative duties and functions of the CJ which I am entitled to perform in an acting capacity on account of complaints before the JSC which have not culminated in my suspension or removal from office,” she said. In his case, Omtatah has asked the court to suspend a December 11 letter by CJ Maraga appointing Mwilu to act as Chief Justice until the position is filled.  The activist told Justice Mrima that no law exists for the appointment of an acting Chief Justice. Hence, the notification by Maraga for Mwilu to act as CJ was unconstitutional.  Four petitions seeking the removal of Mwilu from office are currently pending before the JSC. Some were filed in 2018 and after but have never proceeded.In September last year, the High Court issued orders suspending the hearing of the petitions after Mwilu claimed that some of the commissioners were biased. On Wednesday, Omtatah accused the JSC of colluding with and aiding Mwilu to ascend to the office of the CJ even though she is ineligible to do so. He said the commission has failed to adopt a policy on dealing with petitions for the removal of Mwilu. “By delaying to hear and determine the four petitions seeking her removal, the JSC is guilty of dereliction of duty and has failed to tackle corruption within the Judiciary,” he said.  Maraga’s term in office expires on January 12 and so does his current delegation of duties to the DCJ.Omtatah told Mrima that the Mwilu cannot continue performing those functions beyond the CJ’s tenure.  The court will deliver its ruling January 12(edited by o. owino)"

He also repeated false claims about election fraud.Twitter said it required the removal of three tweets for ""severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy"".The company said the president's account would remain locked for good if the tweets were not removed.It went on to say that ""Future violations of the Twitter Rules... will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account"".It means Donald Trump's days on Twitter could be numbered. The president is not known for paying much attention to Twitter's community guidelines.Meanwhile, Facebook banned Mr Trump for 24 hours. YouTube also removed the video.Facebook said: ""We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.""His supporters stormed the seat of US government and clashed with police, leading to the death of one woman.The violence brought to a halt congressional debate over Democrat Joe Biden's election win.In the House and Senate chambers, Republicans were challenging the certification of November's election results.Before the violence, President Trump had told supporters on the National Mall in Washington that the election had been stolen.Hours later, as the violence mounted inside and outside the US Capitol, he appeared on video and repeated the false claim.He told protesters ""I love you"" and described the people who stormed the Capitol complex as ""patriots"".YouTube said it removed the video because it ""violated policies on spreading election fraud"".Twitter initially didn't take down the video, instead removing the ability to retweet, like and comment on it and another tweet.However, it later removed them, and suspended the outgoing president."
602,"Ruto: My job is to help Uhuru build roads, not advocate BBI","Deputy President William Ruto has said he will steer clear of BBI politics and instead focus on implementing government projects to help the people.As President Uhuru Kenyatta and handshake partner Raila Odinga push to amend the Constitution, Ruto said on Wednesday Kenya is facing many challenges and leaders must focus on solutions for the people.Ruto spoke in Embu county during the funeral service of Cardinal John Njue's sister Jonnes Njuki.The Deputy President said fixing the country's sinking economy, high rates of unemployment and reduced investment are key issues that must be prioritised.""Because there is a lot of work to be done, I will focus on helping President Kenyatta on issues of development; others can drive the BBI agenda,"" Ruto said.""As leaders we must seek solutions to these challenges, however, the solution to these challenges should not take a tribal angle or come up with plans for specific communities.""Leaders from the Mt Kenya region who had accompanied the DP said the BBI is bound to fail since it has been forced down Kenyans' throats when the economy has been driven to its knees.They said BBI proponents were out of touch with the needs and aspirations of ordinary Kenyans, warning the President that those he had entrusted with driving the BBI agenda were misleading him.They included Njeru Ndwiga (Embu), John Muchiri (Manyatta), Eric Muchangi (Runyenjes), Geoffrey King'ang'i (Mbeere South), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Cecily Mbarire (nominated), and Embu Deputy Governor David Njeru.Mbarire said it was insensitive for the government to channel resources to the BBI referendum when the country was grappling with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and already high unemployment.She said parents do not have school fees, schools cannot provide sanitiser and masks for students, the health sector is deteriorating and the economy is in a shambles.""Between all these problems and a Sh14 billion referendum, what should be the priority?” she asked.The former deputy Majority whip in the National Assembly asked President Kenyatta to listen to the plight of the people.Raila and others dispute the cost of the referendum.Muchiri asked why government was determined to hold a costly referendum to greatly enlarge government when the economy was in a slump.Kuria said Kenyans are opposed to the BBI document because most of the key issues they had raised in meetings were not addressed.He said the BBI proponents are characterised by reggae bravado, chest-thumping and contempt and have caused President Kenyatta great embarrassment.""We saw this coming and asked them to bring everyone on board and iron out contentious issues but they turned us down,” Kuria said.King'ang'i said it was unfortunate that those pushing for constitutional amendments do not want to engage in honest conversation about the country's real problems.The truth is that the economy has gone down. We need to relook at our budget and focus on priorities that will uplift citizens,"" he said.Ndwiga said he will not engage in BBI politics since his people had not been provided with BBI documents to enable them to make informed decisions.His sentiments were echoed by Deputy Governor Njeru who said Senate Majority Whip and Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata was distancing himself from individuals ""drunk with power and out of touch with reality"".(Edited by V.

603,"Most Muslim organisations are corrupt, says Kemnac","Free air tickets from the Saudi Arabia meant for poor Kenyan Muslims who wish to travel to Mecca for Hajj do not reach the targeted persons, a Muslim organisation has said.Kenya Muslim National Advisory Council on Wednesday said in most cases those who benefit from the free tickets are people with means.“The tickets from the Saudi Arabian king end up being sold at a cheaper price to people who can actually afford air tickets to Mecca,” said Kemnac chair Sheikh Juma Ngao.He spoke during a press conference at a hotel in Mombasa.The Hajj is an annual pilgrimage made to the ‘Kaaba’, the ""House of God"", in the sacred city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.It is one of the five pillars of Islam, alongside Shahadah, Salat, Zakat and Sawm.It is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim faithful and their submission to God.The Hajj is considered a mandatory religious duty for a Muslim that must be carried out at least once in one's lifetime.Sheikh Ngao said those charged with issuing the tickets end up giving them to relatives instead of poor Muslims who would like to travel to Mecca for Hajj.He, however, said Kemnac will soon establish mechanisms which will ensure the free air tickets benefit the intended poor in society.The air tickets are usually issued to some Muslim organisations in the country, charged with identifying the needy who desire to travel to Mecca for Hajj.“We will investigate the bodies that are charged with this duty of distributing the free tickets and establish how they distribute them,"" Ngao said.“We will then come up with a report and send the report to the Saudi King for his consideration.”He said many Muslim organisations in Kenya are riddled with corruption.“When they request for funds or favours, they do it on behalf of Muslims. When they get the funds or favours, they only remember their own stomachs and families,” Sheikh Ngao said.He said other Islamic nations like Kuwait, Egypt, Turkey and Oman should be careful when they give aid to Kenya through Muslim organisations.“Follow up on your aid. Many end up not serving the purpose for which you intend,” Sheikh Ngao told the helping nations.He said some of the Muslim bodies are fighting cases in court and at the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission because of corruption.Kemnac welcomed the agreement by Saudi Arabia to reopen land, air and sea links with Qatar.According to Kuwaiti government, which has been mediating the dispute, Saudi Arabia has agreed to lift the blockade against Qatar thereby de-escalating a feud that had sharply divided the Middle East for over three years.Qatar’s only land border has been mostly closed since mid-2017 when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain launched the blockade against Qatar.Edited by Henry Makori"

In fact, they should be accorded special care because of their condition,” Omoding added.He urged administrators to provide weekly updates on the progress of admissions and those who will not report will be tracked to their homes.Speaking in his Kapsabet offices, Omoding said officers from the DCI were currently collecting statements from the children with a view to arresting the suspects to face defilement and rape charges.“Under the Sexual Offences Act 2010, defilement and rape are treated extremely seriously because the country wants to protect the girl-child from sex pests,” Omoding said.When Form 4 candidates reported back to school in September 2020, schools were instructed not to take pregnancy tests on the female students to avoid stigma.Edited by Henry Makori"
605,I'm sole survivor of murdered family — Mwingi woman,"Evelyn Wanjugu desolately recalls the night of December 22, just before Christmas, when her family was murdered in a fire near Mwingi.It was set by her father – who often threatened to kill them all – and who also died. Fortunately, Evelyn had taken her baby and left.As she bid goodbye to her mother after closing their Mwingi hotel on the night before, Evelyn didn't know that was the last time she would see her mum alive.The next day, she expected her mother to come to Mwingi town where the two operated a hotel. She never showed up.Evelyn decided to go check on her mother's house in Kavuvwani village, Mwingi West subcounty. The compound was crowded by murmuring villagers, the air was filled with acrid smoke.As she walked towards the home, she saw the homestead was burnt down and worse still, her mother and two siblings were dead inside.“My father kept saying that he would one day kill everyone but we never knew  that the day would finally come,” Evelyn said in tears, cradling her baby. She told her story as neighbours gathered around. She said her parents always had differences that always led to fights and her father, Paul Mwai, often threatened to kill the whole family.“My mother kept telling Dad to leave her house but he insisted on staying there by force amid threats of killing all of us,” she added.Following the threats, Wanjugu and her months-old baby left and moved to Mwingi town, five kilometres away from their village.Wanjugu said the house belonged to her mother and she kept telling Mwai to move out, but he refused.Kavuvwani chief Mwinzi Muvengei said investigations were underway and told residents to remain calm as police unravelled the details of the murders.A neighbour who sought anonymity said the duo were always quarrelling and and the woman's relatives frequently ordered Mwai to leave her alone and return to his Katutu home in Kitui.He never left.Neighbour Peter Musili said when they noticed the midnight fire, they rushed to put it out. They broke the metal door that was locked from the inside.They found the body of 14-year-old girl and her younger brother lying on a sofa.“Their mother had also passed on while the man was producing a funny sound in their bedroom,”Musili said.“We then broke the window and moved the man outside where he was rushed to Mwingi Level 4 Hospital,” he said.Nicholas Mutua, Mwingi Central deputy subcounty police commander, said Paul Mwai died while receiving hospital treatment.Police said the cause of the four deaths was being investigated.The bodies of the four are at the hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem. Burial will be on Saturday.(Edited by V. Graham)"
606,Beer distribution firm boss seeks to stop his prosecution,"A director of a company distributing Danish beer in Kenya is in court to stop his prosecution over allegations of obtaining money by false pretense.Christopher White is also asking the court to compel police to release his passport, which they are holding.White together with Danish brewing company EA Limited and King Beverage Limited have sued the Inspector General  of Police, Director of Criminal Investigations, the AG, DPP and chief magistrate's court Milimani.White is a director of the Danish brewing company EA Limited.According to suit papers, on December 2, 2019 the Danish company and King Beverages entered a distribution agreement with Patiala Distributors Limited.Over a period of time Patiala paid King Beverages Sh102 million for supply of 30,000 cases of Tuborg beer.But sometime in December 2019, Patiala took 10,000 cases of beer and asked the other two companies to keep the balance of 20,000 in storage due to space constraints in its warehouse.Three months later, the Covid-19 pandemic struck, leading to a slowdown in selling of alcoholic products by Patiala. By the time they were sold, the 20,000 cases held by the two companies were nearing expiry.After discussions the two companies agreed to refund the moneys paid by Patiala.But to their surprise on October 30, 2020, while White was in the company of a director of Patiala discussing commercial issues about a shipment, armed officers apprehended him on allegations of possession of illegal firearms.The police officers then drove him to his residence along General Mathenge Road in Nairobi and searched for illegal firearms.White said that in the process of conducting the search the officers intimidated his infant child.The officers, he said, went straight to where he keeps his office items and took away company seals, stamps and a dysfunctional laptop and left without touching anything else.He said the officers later grilled him on wild allegations of him being a Russian spy, lack of religious faith, tax and immigration status.Later on the officers, he said, disclosed their true mission when they started questioning him about allegedly obtaining money by false pretenseHe explains in his suit papers filed under certificate of urgency that the officers forced him to write approximately 102 post-dated cheques for a sum of Sh102 million.The cheques were banked and they all bounced. He now says he has no intention of refunding the money to Patiala.He also says the distributorship agreement was between companies and he did not execute them.Despite that, he says, he is the only one who has been charged with a criminal offence and if the court does not intervene his constitutional rights will be violated."
607,MPs challenge house allowances refund ruling,"MPs have challenged a decision by the High Court that ordered them to reimburse taxpayers more than Sh1 billion they awarded themselves as house allowance.Through lawyer Tom Ojienda, the legislators asked the Court of Appeal to set aside the orders pending the determination of their appeal.Ojienda told a three-judge bench that the orders will make the MPs unable to perform their duties.In the case, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission and activist Okiya Omtatah had challenged a Sh250,000 house allowance that the 416 MPs awarded themselves.Justices Weldon Korir, Pauline Nyamweya and John Mativo ruled in their favour and ordered the MPs to pay back the money they received within 12 months.In a virtual court on Wednesday, Ojienda argued that if the orders are not suspended, then the appeal will be rendered nugatory.Lawyer Peter Wanyama for the SRC opposed the application for stay, saying the application did not meet the threshold for granting any orders at the stage.Wanyama said if the orders are suspended then it will be difficult to recover the money when the case concludes.He told the court that the country is going to elections in a year and it will be impossible to recover the money from the MPs who will lose their seats in 2022.Wanyama said that the money should be collected from the MPs and preserved until the case concludes. If they win the cash will be released.Lawyer Ochiel Dudley also opposed the application and asked the court to consider the public interest in the matter.But Ojienda maintained that the PSC was right in paying the MPs the house allowance to allow them to carry out their functions.He also dismissed the argument that it will be difficult to recover money from MPs who lose their seats.Ojienda told the court that MPs have a pension so there will be no problem in recovering the money from there.The case will be mentioned on March 5.(edited by o. owino)"
608,Crisis deepens as lab techs join nurses' strike,"The health sector crisis deepened on Wednesday after laboratory technologists joined nurses in the countrywide strike.Most doctors and medical clinicians have settled, however, nurses and lab techs are crucial and they walked out of most facilities. Clinicians threaten another walkout if their return-to-work agreement is not registered.Lab technicians demand constant adequate supply of PPE, hiring more officers, risk allowance and payment of delayed salaries in some counties, among others.The National Union of Medical Laboratory Officers on Wednesday said despite there being 25,000 trained lab technologists in Kenya, only 5,600 have been absorbed in the labour market.The officers demonstrated peacefully at Afya House and presented a petition to Health CS Mutahi Kagwe.They gave seven-days' notice to have their grievances addressed.“We are here today to ensure no service is provided by unsatisfied people. You can’t give service on an empty stomach. You can’t give a service in a demoralised environment,” union secretary general Chrispine Momanyi said.“We have a small document that shows exactly what the government through the CS is supposed to do to ensure there is sanity in terms of laboratory service provision starting from risks, promotions, salary payments,” he added.Momanyi said their efforts to reach the ministry to have the issues addressed amicably have failed and their calls have not been answered.The union says some of their members have gone for 15 months without pay, a situation that has turned them into ""beggars"".“They have a family, they have children who are going back to school and they are beggars. We are here to give Kagwe our document. We are here as professionals to ensure we are heard,"" Momanyi said.This comes barely a day after  clinical officers issued a fresh 48-hour strike notice to resume their strike.The union on Tuesday said despite calling off their strike, the situation has remained the same. It said the Council of Governors has distanced itself from the agreement signed by doctors and clinicians.The Council of Governors on Monday said the issues raised in the return-to-work-formula have huge monetary implications that have neither been factored into the current budget nor the forthcoming financial year's budget.Therefore, implementation will require a special conditional grant to each county to implement the agreed issues, the CoG said.Union secretary general George Gibore has accused the governors of being insincere and unrealistic by saying the return-to-work-formula was  signed at individual counties yet acknowledging the ongoing talks at the Labour ministry.""The letter by the CoG is an admission that health services are not properly coordinated in our country since devolution and needs emergency surgery to cure the unending health sector problems,"" Kuku's Gibore said on Tuesday.ODM leader Raila Odinga called on the two levels of government to swiftly solve the stalemate in the health sector.Raila said on Wednesday Kenyans must not be kept permanently on edge over matters that can be sorted without much drama through intergovernmental discussions.He called on the parties involved to respect and implement return-to-work agreements. Failing to do so, he said, makes the government lose capacity and credibility to negotiate in the future. .“Last Thursday, the country breathed a collective sigh of relief when health workers called off their strike after a return to work agreement signed by the Ministry of Health and KMPDU. The talks also included the SRC and a representative from the Council of Governors,” Raila said.“It is therefore shocking that hardly a week later, clinical offices are threatening to down their tools again because the very same issues covered in the RTWF signed last week are not being implemented.""Raila said clinical officers provide care to most patients where specialised treatment is not required, adding that their strike threat comes just after schools were reopened amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“The strike threat also comes at a time the two counties of Nyamira and Migori have their health systems paralysed by the doctors’ strike that is hardly talked about and is running into two months now,” Raila said.He added, “This is therefore a time we need all our health workers on duty or on standby, not on strike or being tossed between the two levels of government.”The nurses' strike entered one month on Thursday.(Edited by V.

609,Hope as India allows export of Covid-19 vaccine,"India has reversed its earlier decision and lifted the ban on export of Covid-19 vaccines.However, options for Kenya and other African countries are dwindling after US pharmaceutical firm Moderna said it has no plans to supply the continent this year.Pfizer said it can only sell Africa 50 million doses in 2021.The constraints are caused by wealthy nations stockpiling excess vaccines from the two companies, whose injections are highly effective.On Tuesday, India’s Ministry of Health clarified the country had only banned export to private markets.“The union government hasn't banned the export of any one of the Covid vaccines. That is something that should be absolutely clear,” Rajesh Bhushan, the ministry's top official, told the BBC.The AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India, also released a statement saying it was ready to make supplies available globally.Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla had said on Sunday the export of vaccines to the Gavi-administered Covax Facility might not begin until March or April, because of the earlier order by the Indian government.This was expected to delay exports to Kenya where the Health ministry said it expected the first doses at the end of this month or next month, from Covax.“Both our companies are fully engaged in this activity and consider it our duty to the nation and the world at large to ensure a smooth rollout of vaccines,” Poonawalla and Bharat Biotech chairman Krishna Ella said in a joint statement on Twitter.  Bharat’s vaccine was given emergency use authorisation in India on Sunday, alongside the AstraZeneca vaccine.More than 12 million doses of different Covid-19 vaccines have been distributed in 33 countries worldwide, but none in Africa, according to statistics by Our World In Data, a research group at the University of Oxford.On Tuesday, the South Africa’s Health Department said it tried buy the Moderna vaccine but the company was adamant it has no intention of selling any injections in Africa soon, the Mail and Guardian reported.Health CS Mutahi Kagwe did not immediately respond to Star’s query on Kenya's plans.However, the ministry has not given indication of contingency plans and is only waiting for supply of 24 million doses from the Covax facility.Gavi told the Star the only assurance is that they will start shipping the AstraZeneca vaccine around the world by the end of March.Kenya had hoped to receive the first shipment at the end of this month.“Our goal, supported by the Government of India, remains to begin supplying doses in the first quarter of this year so that all countries can have timely and equitable access to vaccines,” a Gavi spokesman told the Star.(Edited by V.

610,Bill gives health workers staffing council,"The employment and welfare of health workers will be handled by an independent council if a Bill before the Senate is passed.The Health (Amendment) Bill, 2020, seeks to give the Kenya Health Human Resource Advisory Council more powers to take up the role.Currently, medics staffing and remuneration issues are handled by the Ministry of Health and county governments.In their strikes in December last year, the medics demanded the creation of a health service commission to oversee their employment issues.The Wajir Senator Abdullahi Ibrahim Ali-sponsored Bill will give the council such powers. It will offer advisory services to the national and county governments on recruitment, employment and deployment.It will also make recommendations to the Health CS on policy guiding posting of interns and advise on inter-county and intergovernmental transfers.Further, the agency will advise on the welfare and scheme of service for health professionals; and also on management and rotation of specialists.The council will also have say on maintenance of a master register for all health practitioners in the counties.Kenya Heath Human Resource Advisory Council will also undertake an audit of healthcare workers in the national health system.It will from this, advise the national and county government on the gaps in recruitment and deployment of registered healthcare workers.KHHRAC will also have say on promotions, training, and remuneration of healthcare professionals.“The Council’s enhanced mandate is expected to improve health service delivery in devolved units through the promotion of cooperation between the two levels of government in the critical area of Human Resources for Health,” the Wajir senator said in his memorandum on the legislation.The lawmaker told the Star that he came up with the Bill as a solution to the skewed employment opportunities in counties and unfair promotions.“I am planning to proceed with the Bill since the commission issue might not succeed. The council is the only option next to the health service commission,” Abdullahi said.The Bill also seeks to give county public service boards three slots in the council.“This is because the counties are expected to employ the bulk of the health human resources and decisions of the board are likely to greatly influence the functions of county governments in regard to employment of health human resources.”Posts held by the Attorney General and director-general of health as per the Health Act have been removed.Other members of the council would be a chairperson appointed by Health CS; Health principal secretary; a council of governors’ nominee (not governor); a representative of the Public Service Commission; a nominee by county directors of health; three persons nominated by universities; and a CEO.The BBI task force reported that there were divergent views on the proposed health service commission, with some quarters bidding for a regulatory statutory body to regulate and oversee the employment and deployment of specialised medical staffs who are in short supply.The BBI team has thus proposed amendments to the Health Act to establish the commission to take charge of health workers’ affairs.The commission is envisaged to develop standards for training; recruitment; welfare, career development and schemes of service for healthcare workers.The BBI seeks to provide that the commission deals with intra-country and inter-county transfer of healthcare workers and the national distribution of highly skilled healthcare workers.“The Commission shall facilitate resolution disputes between employers and health care workers in public service both at the national and county levels and accredit health institutions,” the BBI bill reads. (edited by o. owino)"
611,"Joho fires striking doctors, orders them out of staff houses","The Mombasa administration on Wednesday fired striking doctors and ordered them to move out of staff quaters.Dr Abidan Mwachi, the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Union coast branch secretary general, said the letters cited their participation in an ‘illegal’ strike.But Mwachi said the Labour Relations Court had declined to declare the strike illegal as sought by Governor Hassan Joho's administration. The matter is expected to come up again before the court on January 18.Speaking to the press at the Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital on Wednesday, Mwachi said they will not be cowed by the intimidation tactics.“Instead of addressing the issues that have been raised by the doctors, they are now giving us letters purporting to have sacked our members,” he said.The doctors went on strike to demand an end to salary delays, non-remittance of statutory deduction and overdue promotions.“The county has been deducting monies from our payslips to remit to NHIF, PAYE and bank loans. However, this has not been happening,” Mwachi said.“Members who have bank loans are surprised to see that they have defaulted for several months, despite the fact that deductions reflect on their payslips.”The unionist said their members have been forced to pay their own NHIF cover.“In October last year, when we first signed the return-to-work formula, the county government promised to refund our money and address the problems. But nothing was done until we went on strike again on December 21,” he said.On December 24, the county administration asked doctors for a meeting on Christmas Day.“After we failed to attend the meeting on Christmas Day, which is a holiday, the have now decided to take disciplinary action against our members,” he added. (edited by o. owino)"
612,Private schools plead with government to bail them out,"Private schools are seeking a bailout from the government as mass exit has hit them since the full reopening of learning institutions on Monday. Kenya Private School Association chief executive Peter Ndoro on Wednesday said some of the institutions are in a catch22 situation, with about 300 institutions closing shop since march.""This is a sector that has been completely shut down. Schools do not have alternative sources of income apart from the school fees paid,"" he told the Star in a phone interview.Education CS George Magoha  revealed on Wednesday that over 10,000 learners in private schools have moved to public schools since the full reopening of learning institutions on Monday. The CS spoke during a meeting with journalists where he decried negative publicity on government efforts to prepare for school reopening.He said, ""Don’t you think the government is doing what it should to our beloved children, including a medical scheme for all children in secondary school covered by NHIF at Sh4 billion? Give credit to the government where it’s deserved.""Also at the meeting were CSs Farida Karoney for Lands, Jame Macharia (Transport), Joe Mucheru (ICT), CAS Health Mercy Mwangangi and TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia.The exodus is attributed to the closure of over 300 private schools following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly financial difficulty.The private facilities have been out of business since the onset of the coronavirus in mid-March.The hard knock on private institutions, Ndoro argued, was worsened by the lack of a bailout earlier promised by the government.""The government had promised schools Sh7.6 billion package to help them during the lockdown period but this never materialised... most of these institutions operate on loans,""  Ndoro said.To correct this, the schools are seeking government intervention through the provision of capitation to private schools.The government provides capitation to public schools under the Free Primary and Free Day Secondary Education programmes.Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi on Wednesday noted that the two approved vaccines Pfizer and Moderna were not tested on children in the trial phase, thus are only for adult use.It will be a relief for teachers whom, she said, will be considered part of the frontline workers. They will be among the first to receive the vaccine when it becomes available.She revealed that the country has ordered 24 million vaccine doses.The doses, the Health Ministry says, will be distributed first to the frontline workers and those in the vulnerable bracket.Last month, acting director general of Public Health Patrick Amoth said the government will start administering the Covid-19 vaccine in the first quarter of teh year.Edited by Henry Makori"
613,Counties with most dangerous roads listed,"You are more likely to be involved in a road accident within Nairobi, Nakuru, Kiambu, Machakos and Kakamega counties, a five-year trend shows.Most accidents in these counties occur between 4pm and 9pm.Counties with the next most dangerous roads are Makueni, Kisumu, Kilifi, Meru, Nyeri, Bungoma and Mombasa in that order.According to the new analysis, road users in Kenya are safest in Wajir, Tigania, Nyahururu, Moyale, Malindi and Mandera areas in that order.The analysis was conducted by dons from Dedan Kimathi University and Japan’s Gifu University on road accident data from the National Transport and safety Authority between 2015 and 2020.They said high populations in some counties, paved road networks and motorised transport played a big role in the accidents. The trend indicates a worsening situation.Between January 2015 and January 2020, there was an increase of 26 per cent and 46.5 per cent in deaths and injured persons, respectively.“Urgent fine-tuning of policing to protect vulnerable road users as well as curb the overly decried driver behaviour is needed,” authors say in the study, published recently in the Cogent Engineering journal.The authors are Joseph Kamau and Waweru Njeri of Dedan Kimathi University; and Minoru Sasaki and Kojiro Matsushita of Japan.Boda bodas are largely responsible for the worsening situation.In 2007, Kenya had fewer than 100,000 registered motorcycles—today the number stands at over 800,000, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. Four categories were also identified as the leading causes of fatalities on roads – knocking down victims, hit-and-run, vehicle losing control and head-on collision.The overall probability for the cause is given as 35.34 per cent prevalence in running over victims followed by 27.73 per cent for hit-and-run, 18.03 per cent for lost control, and 18.89 per cent for head-on collisions.“All these causes point to driver errors and are preventable with proper measures,” the authors say.The study also notes injuries and deaths from road accidents are grossly underreported in Kenya.NTSA places the annual fatalities between 3,000 and 4,500 deaths per year since 2015.Compared to the total population, this translates to fatality rate between 5.8 and 8.7 per 100,000 people.“We have all reasons to question these numbers given that the global fatality rate as at 2016 was 18.2 per 100,000 with African countries most severe,” the authors say.The reporting also lacks accident-relevant details that would enable further accident analysis.“Details like weather conditions, road intersection and type, drivers age, drunk/speeding behaviour, vehicle category should be included for further analysis,” they said."
614,"2000 deaf, blind learners get stationery, mentorship on reopening","Some 2,000 deaf and blind secondary school learners will benefit from stationery, masks, and mentorship programs for smooth learning during Covid-19.Learners from Thika School for the blind and Kambui School for the deaf in Kiambu County, Kibos School for the blind and Fr Oudera School for the deaf in Kisumu County will receive braille papers, workbooks, and stationery until February.Dubbed the Rising Stars Project, the initiative by the Chevening Kenya Alumni Association on Tuesday started distributing the material aimed at promoting equality among all Kenyan learners.“Most school programs are not tailored to young people living with a disability. The mentorship programs are instrumental in assisting learners living with disability smoothly transition to adulthood,” the association said.Statistics indicate that one in every 10 Kenyans below the age of 21, mostly those of school-going age, is disabled.According to the Special Schools Heads Association of Kenya (SSHAK), some 100, 000 children with disability are out of school every year. Following this, the association says the situation among learners living with disabilities is dire, thus indicating an urgent need to invest more in education for such learners.Currently, many donors have pulled out because of the Covid-19 economic effects and left such schools on their own.Further, there is limited government support for such institutions according to the alumni.“A learner in a special school pays up to Sh 10,000 per term yet, a ream of braille photocopy papers costs between Sh 6000 and 9000. This means that one learner’s fee is only capable of buying a ream of papers,” Jane Gitau, the association chair said.The chair asserted that despite the virus affecting all learners, it has hit learners living with disabilities hardest.The association has thus called on the state and donors to support such learners to promote inclusive education for those living with disabilities.According to the United Nations, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on learners with disabilities who were already experiencing social and educational disadvantage pre-covid."
615,Uhuru outlines Kenya’s four-point agenda at the United Nations Security Council,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has outlined a four-point agenda that Kenya will advance as the country settles into its non-permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).The president listed leveraging the knowledge and buy-in of stakeholders closest to crises and supporting the Security Council as well as associated UN bodies.This will strengthen the capacity of state institutions during post-conflict reconstruction as two of the measures that Kenya will support.“The Peace-building Commission will play an invaluable role, which Kenya will support closely over the next two years,” Uhuru said.He spoke on Wednesday evening during a virtual meeting of the UNSC on the challenges of maintaining peace and security in fragile contexts.Uhuru said that Kenya will back measures aimed at strengthening the role of Africa and the Global South in the multilateral system as well as ensuring that the Covid-19 pandemic does not become a major driver of insecurity.“If fragile countries do not get prompt access to the vaccine, their economic problems will likely turn into political and security challenges. Affordable and quick access to the Covid-19 vaccine should, therefore, be regarded as a valuable investment in peace,” He said.Congratulating President Kais Saied of Tunisia for assuming the Presidency of the Security Council for the month of January 2021, Uhurua noted that Tunisia played a pivotal role in the adoption of Resolution 2532 by which the UNSC recognised the devastating impact of Covid-19 especially in countries in conflict or post-conflict situations.President Kenyatta’s participation at the meeting follows Kenya’s assumption of its position at the UNSC as a non-permanent member for two years on Monday evening.He noted that peace will only be maintained if countries faced with conflict are facilitated to be strong enough to win control of their territory and provide public services.“The multilateral system, as embodied in the UN, will therefore need to help fragile states attain such capacities. The political processes that build peace and binding resolutions by this council should include measurable state strengthening elements.”The president also emphasised that the road to revitalising multilateralism to effectively deliver global peace and security must run through a united Africa and an active and engaged Global South.Noting that the Security Council spends the bulk of its agenda on conflicts in Africa, Uhuru said this is testament to the fragility of many countries and regions on the continent.“If we are to be true to the founding charter of the UN, it follows, therefore, that we should invest more in building more effective approaches or revitalizing existing mechanisms, that maintain peace and anchor stability in Africa.”He commended Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for becoming the plus one of the Africa three, saying the move allows the hundreds of millions in Africa, the Caribbean and other parts of the world to believe that their voice in the Security Council matters.“That belief will lead to greater faith in the United Nations and its decisions. It is for this reason that I have tasked our Mission to the UN to be a strong voice for a united Africa, for the Global South and the General Assembly,” President Kenyatta said.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf highlighted the root causes of global conflicts and called for a concerted effort to address them."
616,Matiang’i orders administrators to trace 3% learners out of school,"Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has ordered county commissioners and chiefs to trace three per cent of learners who have not returned to school.The administrators will be helped by Nyumba Kumi Initiative members to trace all learners, including those who are pregnant.CS Matiang'i said he was impressed that 97 per cent of learners had by Wednesday morning reported back to school.""County commissioners will work closely with the chiefs and members of Nyumba Kumi Initiative in every village in mapping out each and every village to ensure that all learners are in school. The government is not ready to accept any reason why a child is at home while others are in class,"" he said.The CS spoke on Wednesday at Ikuu Girls’ High School in Tharaka Nithi county during an inspection tour. He also visited Kajiunduthi.At Kajiunduthi High School, 84 students had not resumed learning. At Ikuu Girls’ High School 45 were still away while 12 pupils had not reported back at Kiereni Primary School.He directed county commissioner Beverly Opwora to make sure they are back to school. The CS said even those students who are pregnant must continue learning.""Even pregnant girls must report back to school and continue learning under the care of teachers and education officers. Those who give birth should be allowed back to school to continue with their education,"" he said.Matiang'i said 311 students are pregnant in Tharaka Nithi county alone.The CS said management of schools he had inspected had made great progress in setting up handwashing points, ensuring social distancing in classrooms and wearing face masks by learners.""Officers from the ministries of Interior and Education have launched a manhunt to ensure that learners who are yet to report to school are traced,"" the CS said.He said President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed that the government should direct its energy in ensuring that all learners resume studies without fail and that schools are prepared to protect them from Covid-19.Matiang'i said his ministry will this week be going around schools to ensure all schoolchildren are back and that Covid-19 measures are adhered to."

619,"Ruto shuns BBI, ask leaders to focus on challenges facing Kenyans","Deputy President William Ruto has said that he will focus his energy on the implementation of government projects.""Because there is a lot of work to be done, I will focus on helping President Kenyatta on issues of development; others can drive the BBI agenda,"" Ruto said.The DP spoke on Wednesday during the funeral service of Cardinal John Njue's sister Jonnes Njuki in Manyatta, Embu County.Ruto asked leaders to focus on finding solutions to challenges facing Kenyans.He pointed out the country's poor economy, high rates of unemployment, and reduced investments as some of the key issues that ought to be prioritised.""As leaders, we must seek solutions to these challenges, however, the solution to these challenges should not take a tribal angle or come up with plans for specific communities,"" Ruto said.A section of leaders from Mt Kenya who accompanied Ruto backed Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata's sentiments on the popularity of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).They said proponents of BBI were out of touch with the needs and aspirations of ordinary Kenyans.The leaders warned President Uhuru Kenyatta that those he had trusted with driving the BBI agenda were misleading him.They were Njeru Ndwiga (Embu), John Muchiri (Manyatta), Eric Muchangi (Runyenjes), Geoffrey King'ang'i (Mbeere South), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Cecily Mbarire (nominated), and Embu Deputy Governor David Njeru.Mbarire said it was insensitive for the government to channel resources to referendum when the country was grappling with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.She said parents do not have school fees to take their children to school, schools cannot provide sanitisers and masks for students, the health sector is deteriorating and the economy is in shambles.""Between all these problems and the Sh14 Billion referendum, what should be the priority?” She posed.Mbarire asked President Kenyatta to listen to the plight of the people.Muchiri wondered how the government was determined to have a costly referendum when the country’s economy is slumping.Kuria said Kenyans are opposed to the BBI document because most of the key issues they had raised were not addressed.He said the proponents of the BBI approach characterised by reggae bravado, chest-thumping, and contempt had caused the President a lot of embarrassment.""We saw this coming and asked them to bring everyone on board and iron out contentious issues but they turned us down,” Kuria said.King'ang'i said it was unfortunate that those pushing for constitutional amendments do not want to engage in honest conversation about the situation in the country."

622,KDF soldier arrested after defiling 16-year-old relative,"A Kenya Defence Forces soldier has been arrested after he defiled a minor.The officer based in Embakasi was arrested after he was involved in an accident while with the minor.DCI boss George Kinoti on Wednesday said the man had promised to drive the 16-year-old form one girl to school in Othaya, but instead made a detour to a lodging in Kiriaini and defiled her before proceeding with the journey.""However, he instead sped towards Nyahururu, past the intended destination. His sins were laid bare minutes later when his vehicle was involved in a road mishap at Muringato at around 6 pm,"" Kinoti said.On questioning on what he was doing with a school girl who happens to be his relative, Kinoti said the man couldn’t explain the presence of the minor satisfactorily prompting his arrest.""Disturbingly, the suspect is a relative to the minor and had promised to take her to school, a promise which didn’t see the light of day,"" he said.Kinoti said officers escorted the minor to Nyeri County Referral Hospital for the necessary medical tests to be conducted.The man is meanwhile placed in custody pending arraignment."
623,"Raila calls for speedy solution to health stalemate, wants medics deal implemented","ODM leader Raila Odinga has called on the two levels of government to move with speed and resolve the existing stalemate in the health sector.Raila in a statement on Wednesday said Kenyans must not be kept permanently on the edge and worried over matters that can be sorted without much drama through intergovernmental discussions that the public need not know.The opposition chief has further called on the parties involved to respect and implement return to work agreements once agreed upon, adding that failure to do so makes the government lose the capacity and authority to negotiate in future.“Last Thursday, the country breathed a collective sigh of relief when health workers called off their strike after a return to work agreement signed by the ministry of health and KMPDU. The talks also included SRC and a representative from the Council of Governors,” Raila said.“It is therefore shocking that hardly a week later, clinical offices are threatening to down their tolls again because the very same issues covered in the RTWF signed last week are not being implemented,” he added.Raila noted that clinical officers provide care to most patients where specialized treatment is not required, adding that their threat to down their tools comes just after when schools in the country were reopened, and amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“The strike threat also comes at a time two counties of Nyamira and Migori have their health systems paralysed by doctors’ strike that is hardly talked about and is running into two months now,” Raila said.He added: “This is therefore a time we need all our health workers on duty or on standby, not on strike or being tossed around between the two levels of government.”The CoG on Monday bolted out of the agreement signed with the unions after holding their extra-ordinary council meeting.This has made the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers leadership issue a fresh strike notice should their agreement remain unsigned in full 48 hours; a period lapsing on Thursday.The council chair Wycliffe Oparanya said the issues raised in the RTWF have huge monetary implication that have neither been factored in the current budget nor the forthcoming financial year.He said this will require a special conditional grant allocated to each county for implementation of the said issues."
624,Uhuru mourns death of NYS director general's mother,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to the family of NYS director general Matilda Sakwa following the death of her mother Florence Oyiela.Oyiela, a retired teacher, passed away on Tuesday while receiving treatment at a Nairobi hospital.In his message of comfort and encouragement, Uhuru mourned Oyiela as a highly accomplished teacher who contributed immensely to the growth of the education sector in the country.“Mwalimu Florence had a big impact in the education sector as she taught very many prominent personalities. She also ensured that all her children attained the highest level of education,” Uhuru noted on Wednesday.Oyiela, a teacher of English, taught in several schools over the years among them Lwak Girls, Kisumu Technical, Mutuini Secondary School, Dagoretti High and Ofafa Jericho High before retiring.The head of state said Oyiela will be missed by many Kenyans especially the girls and women she mentored.“My deepest condolences to the family, friends and relatives of Mama Florence Sakwa for the loss. My thoughts and prayers are with you at this difficult time of mourning.“It is my prayer that the Almighty God will give you the strength and courage to bear the loss,” Uhuru said."
625,Keep off schools: Magoha scolds media over Covid-19 coverage,"Education CS George Magoha on Wednesday scolded the media for its coverage of the Covid-19 situation in schools.Magoha accused the fourth estate of not being objective in its coverage.Speaking at a Nairobi hotel while meeting education stakeholders Magoha said the media was only focusing on the negative side while not highlighting the gains that have been made.As a result, the CS said no media or parents will be allowed in schools.He said this will give learners across the country ample time to focus without many distractions.Magoha said he has reached a point where he has pulled back because he no longer trusts the media.He said the media was leaking top-secret documents that are yet to be finalised.""I have pulled back because I no longer understand the methods you use to scoop information that is not ready. When we tell you to wait please do not try to get what is not yet cooked,"" he said.""...my weakness is to tell you the truth so that we do not argue about it. You even have the audacity to draw funny cartoons about me but I want to let you know that being a public servant I can take all the arrows because I am very strong,"" he added.Magoha said the government has done a lot of things to ensure the education system works well for all learners.""Don't you think the government is doing what it has that it should do for our beloved children? That is not to mention the medical scheme for all children in secondary schools covered by NHIF at a price of Sh4 billion,"" he said.""This information is with you because we have given it to you separately in the past. So if you look at your database you will find that you have this information, kindly let us give credit to the government where it is deserved,"" he added.Magoha said for instance the ministry is just about to wind up the  CBC Task Force but some journalists have already snooped around reporting on things that are yet to be finalised.""That is so unfair for people in your profession to report on matters that have not been finalised. Nobody is perfect and I should not be demonised because I am not looking for a job but just serving the children,"" agitated Magoha said.With regards to social distancing in schools, Magoha admitted that it was a challenge for schools to achieve it.He said many public schools are overpopulated but the government is doing all it can to ensure that the laid down covid-19 protocols are observed.Magoha said as a result, currently is is impractical for schools to maintain social distance in classrooms, compounds and boarding houses.""What is the best option, is it to have the children transferred to other schools or try to maintain other protocols minus social distance?,"" he posed.The CS said the government is doing all it can to ensure smooth learning resumes despite the prevailing challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic."
626,Why Kenyan children will not receive Covid-19 vaccine,"No child will receive the much anticipated Covid-19 vaccine once it is available in the country, the Health Ministry has said.Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said that the two approved vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna were not tested on children in the trial phase thus are only eligible for adult use.Mwangangi also noted that the children would not be considered among the first to get the vaccine even if they were eligible as they are not within the category of those classified as highly vulnerable.She further revealed that the country has ordered 24 million vaccine doses.The doses, the Health Ministry says, will be distributed first to the frontline workers and those in the vulnerable bracket.Also categorised as frontline workers are teachers, meaning they will also be part of those receiving vaccines once they are available.Last month, Acting Director-General Public Health Patrick Amoth said the government will start administering the Covid-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021.Amoth said the government had singled out one vaccine that has attained all the trial parameters set.Amoth said the AstraZeneca vaccine is already registered for use and that the country was part to its clinical trials in the Kilifi Wellcome Trust Research Programme.The acting DG said the vaccine has shown good efficacy and will be one of the frontline vaccines that will be used in the country.He further pointed out that the country is set to receive 24 million doses of the vaccine under the Covax facility to which Kenya is a signatory.The facility brings together over 189 countries in search of one common vaccine.The beneficiaries of the vaccine will be the 430,000 frontline health workers, in both public and private facilities representing one per cent of the total population.The second cluster of beneficiaries will be those over 50 years old who tend to contract the more severe form of the disease and are about 5.3 million an equivalent of 10 per cent of the general population.The government will also prioritise about 4.4 million Kenyans with pre-existing conditions who represent 8 per cent of the population.About 830,000 Teachers and uniformed security forces will then be considered, bringing the total figure of the initial vaccinations to about 21 per cent."
627,Parents tell 'funny' stories of kids ignoring anti-Covid rules,"These stories told by parents about back to school would be really funny - if they didn't also have a troubling side.After nine months of closure and in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, parents narrate 'amusing' incidents from young and older learners alike on schools' reopening.We've rounded up some 'hilarious' posts and parents' interviews about Day One:In a post that went viral on Twitter, a user identified as Mohamed Wahliye narrated how his niece came back with a different mask from the one she wore to school in the morning.“She told her mum she didn't like hers & she swapped it with Angela! With a straight face,” the tweet reads.The tweet has gained traction with social media users giving their reactions and observations on observance of Covid  protocols.Sam Mwenda17 narrates his kindergarten son's experience.He tweets, “My son in PP2 resumed school today for the first time post-Covid-19 and all they did today was learn the Covid precautionary measures. I just went to pick him from school and found him sharing a lollipop with his friend.""Another user, @ iDismas, replying to the tweet, said, “Well, at least amerudi na mask [he is back with a mask], my nephew is back na anasema ako njaa [he is hungry]. Can’t ask about mask because one of the shoelaces is missing.”@BlazeCassidy said, “I am waiting for my backbencher son, because I think I will have him take a bath at the doorstep.”A sarcastic comment from Ba Mdogo noted the list of noisemakers will now be replaced by the list of those without masks.Tweep with username Philosopher replied to Mohamed Wehliye, “Another one here is telling us  how they wore masks when the teacher is in class. ""Akitoka watu wanatoa masks. She's already bored, eti kesho hataki kwenda shule.”Others commented how students will be borrowing masks from classmates so they can go see a teacher in the staffroom.“Bro, nisaidie [help me with your] necktie na mask niende [to go to the] staff-room, this will happen in every school, furthermore they will also share utensils, especially tablespoons.""An interviewee told the Star that on jokingly asking his nephew on why he was not wearing his mask in class, the child replied, “Nilikua nimevaa, lakini ilikua tu hapa chini ya mapua.”Loosely translated, ""I was wearing it but below my nose.""(Edited by V.

629,Bill imposes Sh1m fine for voter intimidation during primaries,"Politicians who prevent voters from accessing polling stations during party primaries could be fined up to Sh1 million if a new Bill is passed by the Senate.The Bill sponsored by Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura is meant to ensure fairness and tame chaos often witnessed in party primaries.The law also seeks to set caps for nomination fees and requires candidates to sign declaration forms before taking part in primaries.The Political Party Primaries Bill, 2020, is due for Second Reading in the Senate.It allows the IEBC to accredit institutions to conduct nominations on behalf of political parties.“A political party may at its own cost hire an institution accredited by the commission to conduct a party primary,” the Bill reads.Mwaura wants presidential aspirants charged a maximum Sh1 million nomination fees, Sh500,000 for governors, Sh250,000 for MPs and Sh50,000 for MCAs.Most parties charge presidential aspirants Sh1 million, between Sh300,000 and Sh500,000 for governor hopefuls and between Sh100,000 and Sh50,000 for MPs.ODM charges Sh25,000 for MCA aspirants while Jubilee charges Sh50,000 nomination fee for the same seat. The rest are within the Sh20,000 range.Parties will be required, for accountability, to declare such fees as paid by aspirants 14 days before the date of a primary.“The fees payable by members of the marginalised groups shall not exceed half the fee charged to other aspirants,” the proposed law reads.Aspirants seeking nomination will also be required to sign declaration forms stating they will meet party obligations; produce valid educational certificates when required and be of good moral standing in society.To be considered, aspirants would thus be required to present their academic qualifications, ID, a self-declaration form as prescribed under the Leadership and Integrity Act and proof of payment of the nomination fees.Mwaura’s proposal further imposes a Sh5 million fine for persons who fraudulently registers or deregisters a person as a member of a political party.Politicians risk the fine for providing false information during party membership registration as well as forging, defacing or destroying a party membership register.Failure to use the political party membership register published by the registrar, in the conduct of party primary, will also be an offence.Mwaura also seeks thorough vetting of nominees by parties before they are presented to the IEBC for inclusion on the ballot.Parties in coalition agreements will also be required to provide in the agreement, the procedure for nominating a candidate for an elective post.The senator further wants the IEBC to specify a day or days for party primaries to observed as public holidays.The bill proposes that nominations be concluded 90 days before the general election and 55 days for the case of a by-election.“An employer or any person in charge of an employee who is a member of a political party that is undertaking a party primary shall permit that employee to participate in the relevant party primary on the day or days specified,” the bill reads.Mwaura also wants political parties compelled to maintain a national register and for every county, constituency, and wards.The proposed law provides that the membership register of a political party shall be accessible to members of the public.Only persons whose details are contained in the membership register certified by a party’s governing body will be allowed to vote in the primaries.Parties would be required to present names of aspirants gearing for nomination to the IEBC and political parties’ registrar 21 days to the vote.Candidates for an election would have to be presented to the IEBC at least 90 days to the general election.“A political party shall not change the candidate nominated after the nomination of that person has been received by the Commission,” the bill reads.There would be exceptions from incidents such as death, resignation, or incapacity of the nominated candidate.In such as a case, political parties will be required to present the substitute before the date of presentation of nomination papers. (edited by o. owino)"
630,Conman gets three years for stealing laptops,"A man who conned six Nairobi Aviation college students out of their phones and laptops will serve three years in jail instead of 18 years.He had lied that he would help them secure internship position at the Kenya Medical Research Institute and they took the bait.The man was not identified because of his health condition.in 2015, the trial court termed him a smooth-talking individual who took advantage of young people by dangling the mirage of internships to entrap them and steal their laptops and phones.The court found him undeserving of mercy and fined him Sh50,000 for each count – a total of Sh300,000. Otherwise, he was to serve three years in prison for each count, the sentences to run consecutively – 18 years.The man first turned to the High Court and said he was remorseful and reformed. He cited a litany of ailments and family suffering as a result of his incarceration. He sought a noncustodial sentence.The High Court dismissed his application leading to a second appeal.On December 18, 2020, Appeal Court judges Roselyne Nambuye, Patrick Kiage and Sankale ole Kantai ruled the lower court should have ruled it was a single transaction, hence, the sentences should run concurrently. Three years.“This appeal is meritorious and we allow it. We set aside the order that the sentence in the six counts runs consecutively and substitute an order that the same run concurrently from the date the appellant was first sentenced,"" they ruledThe prosecution said that on June 18, 2012, the man presented himself as an audacious con artist and clever thief who came up with a simple but devastating ruse.Describing himself as a doctor working with the Kenya Medical Research Institute, he entered the Nairobi Aviation College at Kahawa House.There he spun the believable tale that he was offering Kemri internships and requested a group of students to accompany him there.Soon, six excited students were aboard his vehicle bearing the name of Kimisa Sacco, each carrying a pen and a laptop computer as he had instructed them.On reaching the site of the promised internship, the six were told to disembark from the minibus and enter a building, leaving their laptops in the vehicle.They did so and then the man entered the van, took the laptops, transferred them to his car and drove off.When the students returned to find their mentor and laptops gone, they realised they had been duped and reported the theft to the Central police station.The man was eventually arrested and charged with six counts of theft. He pleaded guilty to all six counts.Though he declared himself remorseful and reformed, the trial magistrate was unimpressed. He also said he had been saved, had become a spiritual leader and was on antiretroviral therapy.(Edited by V. Graham)"
631,"Igathe didn't formally resign, 'he's governor' - city voter","A Nairobi voter has said former Deputy Governor Polycarp Igathe ought to have taken over from Mike Sonko since he never formally resigned.His resignation on January 12, 2018, was never communicated to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.In court documents, voter Patrick Kiiru says the IEBC has no right to call a by-election to fill the vacancy in the office of impeached Governor Sonko since a deputy governor is already in place.He says Igathe should automatically take over.The IEBC called a by-election for February 18 but Sonko won an injunction, pending hearing of his case. He argues he was removed without following procedure.“The the impending by-election as gazetted by the IEBC is premature and unconstitutional,” voter Kiiru says.Kiiru argues the by-election notice is both irregular and premature as it is based on a wrongful interpretation of the Constitution and the law on filling the vacancy in a governor's office.“One of the ways a vacancy can occur in the office of the governor and by extension that of the deputy governor is through resignation. Such resignation ought to be communicated in writing to the office of the speaker of the county assembly,” he says.The case was listed for hearing on Tuesday before Justice Anthony Mrima but he recused himself on the grounds that one of the lawyers in the case is closely related to him. “I am closely related to George Kithi and it is not fair for me to hear the case. The best thing is to recuse myself and order the file be placed before another judge,” he said. He directed that the matter be mentioned before a new judge on January 19 to fix a hearing date. He directed Kiiru serve Sonko with his papers after parties said they were not opposed to Sonko being included in the case.Kiiru wants the court to declare Gazette Notice 10914 of 2020 unconstitutional and order the IEBC to issue him with documents pertaining to the purported vacancy of the office of the deputy governor.The voter also seeks a declaration that Igathe failed to follow the legal requirements in tendering his resignation and therefore a vacancy has not occurred in the office of the deputy governor.Kiiru also asked the court to issue a permanent injunction restraining the IEBC from conducting any by election in Nairobi. “There is no clear legal standpoint regarding s a vacancy in the office of the deputy governor. It is important for the court to give a decision on such legal issues before a by-election is conducted to avert a crisis whereby a new governor would be elected when there is already one [presumably Igathe] in office,” he says. According to the court documents, the resignation was not communicated to the speaker of the assembly as stipulated by the Constitution. Kiiru says since there was no clear position on resignation of Igathe, the former assembly speaker wrote to the IEBC inquiring whether it was aware of the Igathe’s resignation, before the assembly could proceed with the vetting of the nominee.Before the commission could respond to the inquiry by the former speaker, the anti-corruption court issued orders stopping the vetting of the nominee of the appointee deputy governor. However, the electoral body eventually responded to the enquiry in a letter dated January last year. It indicated that it was not aware of a vacancy in the office of the deputy governor and this was the assembly position until December 21 when the IEBC published the challenged Gazette notice of a by-election on February 18.  ""The Gazette notice has compounded the question of the vacancy even further since the IEBC itself had acknowledged there was no vacancy in the office of the DG who ought to assume the office of the county governor in case a vacancy in the latter's office occurs,” he says.Kiiru has sued the IEBC and the Attorney General. The acting governor of Nairobi, Igathe, the assembly and the Jubilee Party have been listed as interested parties.(Edited by V. Graham)"
632,MPs oppose Treasury effort to raise debt ceiling to Sh12 trillion,"The Treasury will find it difficult to raise the debt ceiling to Sh12 trillion from the current Sh9 trillion because some MPs oppose the plan.The lawmakers say it would be untenable to allow the Treasury to go on another borrowing spree by raising the debt ceiling.Sources say the Jubilee administration is planning fresh amendments to the Public Finance Management Regulations to push the debt cap. Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani had yet to respond to the Star’s enquiries on the matter by press time.But some MPs said the proposal might not sail through Parliament because of the country’s sorry economic situation.A ranking member told the Star that the first challenge would be lobbying lawmakers to back the proposal.The same scenario played out when Treasury sought Parliament’s approval for the current Sh9 trillion cap.The other reason is that Parliament is currently polarised by the Building Bridges Initiative politics and 2022 succession.Eldama Ravine MP and Budget committee vice chair Moses Lessonet said his team was unaware of plans to raise the debt ceiling.But the committee would recommend the state works within the limit of Sh9 trillion cap if the matter came up to them.“The government has to work a strategy to fit within the range. The economy has not expanded that much to accommodate a figure beyond Sh9 trillion,” Lessonet said.Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki said if the Treasury pushed the proposal through, the situation would turn for the worst as Kenya is already sinking in debt.The lawmaker argued that the “simple, painless solution to our current fiscal crisis it to drop all non-essential, non- emergency expenditure from the budget.” He’d vote no should the proposal go to the Senate.The former Senate deputy speaker says removal of foreign travel, entertainment costs and downward review of all allowances would help.“…downsize or remove all together all non-urgent projects and programmes in all departments at both the national and county governments,” Kindiki said.President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration is only Sh590 billion short of breaking cap set by MPs in October 2019.The situation, experts say, portends a crisis in the next financial year with the projected budget deficit of Sh907 billion.The shortfall means the government would not be able to fund Sh317 billion of its budget, affecting key projects.Public debt, according to the latest Treasury reports was Sh8.41 trillion as of August 2020 against the ceiling of Sh9 trillion.The stock of public debt accounts for Sh7.06 trillion, or 69.2 per cent of gross domestic product, while there is an undisbursed debt of Sh1.35 trillion.About 47 per cent of total government revenue – about Sh904.7 billion – has been set aside this fiscal year as debt servicing payment.Already, the public debt sustainability indicators, as per the medium-term debt management strategy, illustrate that Kenya faces a high risk of debt distress.Parliamentary Budget Office says there will be no way the National Treasury would escape breaking the cap.In highlights on the debt situation, the office says the country’s economy was struggling a situation now worsened by the adverse effects of Covid-19.PBO argues that following the disruption, interest payments went high amid low revenue collection from imports and exports.Abraham Rugo, country manager of International Budget Partnership – Kenya, told the Star that the country is already in a crisis.He said it was disappointing that no government official has made a call on reducing expenditure yet.Rugo said there were no two ways about managing the deficit apart from increasing revenue and reducing expenditure.In this regard, he said the best bet would be for the government to stop unnecessary construction projects, non-essential expenditure and new contracts.“We cannot continue on an expanded expenditure framework. We are going to sink the country deeper into debt. Desperate times call for desperate measures but doesn’t mean you put your house on fire,” he said.The expert warned that next year will be a harsh one if the government continues with spending at the current rate, and puts cash to the BBI and referendum.“Everything that can go wrong with a fiscal plan is going wrong in our case. We hope for once the President and Parliament can rein in and say we cannot continue digging deeper.”He said that an aggregate number was not the problem, but the discipline of government to live within its means.(edited by o. owino)"
633,Scramble for ODM candidate in Nairobi by-election intensifies,"The scramble to be named ODM deputy governor candidate intensified as Jubilee moved closer to announcing its governor aspirant in the Nairobi by-election.Lobbying went a notch higher for ODM as Jubilee continued to vet the names of members who have shown interest. The two parties will be fielding a joint candidate in the by-election.ODM said the seat belonged to Jubilee and as such it will back its candidate. The Orange party will field a running mate.Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju said they are still in the process of vetting members who have shown interest in contesting for the seat.“We are vetting the candidates who have shown interest. As soon as we are done with the vetting, we will conduct interviews. Jubilee wants to field the best candidate because we cannot lose this seat,” he said.Tuju told the Star that ODM was, however, yet to inform him of the person they have picked as the running mate.“The only thing that is troubling us is the court case. We are studying it to see what it means for us to decide whether we should organise ourselves now or wait until the matter is settled,” he said.Former Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru and businesswoman Agnes Kagure want to contest on the Jubilee ticket.Justice Anthony Mrima on Monday suspended the special Gazette notice issued by the IEBC calling for a by-election in February following the impeachment of Mike Sonko.Sonko moved to court challenging his removal from office, claiming that due process was not followed.Several names have popped up as possible running mate to the Jubilee candidate. They include secretary general Edwin Sifuna, Women's League chairperson Beth Syengo and former Homa Bay senator aspirant Fred Rabongo.Rabongo came third in the race for the Homa Bay senator seat during the 2015 by-election that was occasioned by the death of Otieno Kajwang.An astute businessman, Rabongo said he is ready to serve residents of Nairobi if the party finds him fit to serve the people in that position.“I am a diehard member of ODM and I have worked and supported the party. Having run for Homa Bay senator twice and with my experience and success in business, I think I have what it takes to serve the people of Nairobi as their deputy Governor,” he said.Rabongo was among the 15 Kenyan entrepreneurs, including Manu Chandaria and SK Macharia, who were profiled in a book published by East Africa Publishers as the most promising business people in the region.He is also a former National Social Security Fund (NSSF) managing trustee.Sifuna said he is open to the offer should ODM settle on him as the deputy governor candidate. Sifuna has been seen to appeal to the huge Luhya vote bloc.A considerable number of ODM officials are said to be vouching for Syengo to get the ticket.Tuju assured those who have shown interest of a free and fair process.“At the moment, only two have shown interest. There are others who have put across their intent, but we have two serious ones as of now,” he added."
634,"I'm proud of my record, will continue with pastoral work — Njue","John Cardinal Njue who stepped down on Monday as the Catholic Archbishop of Nairobi intends to remain active in pastoral work even in retirement.And if he were to meet former US President Barrack Obama today and a conversation about gay rights came up, he would tell him the same thing he said in 2013, ""forget, forget and forget.""Njue told the Star in an exclusive interview on Tuesday that if given another chance to be the head of Catholic Church in the country again, he would do it the same way: strongly defend conservative family values, reject same-sex relations and be circumspect about foreign developed vaccines.He is proud of his record, he said. The Catholic congregation has expanded, faith communities have become more self-reliant and communities have become more involved and self-driven in the church's work, he recounted.Njue was ordained a priest in 1973 and later served as bishop of Embu. He moved to Nyeri as archbishop before he was moved to Nairobi in 2007 and made cardinal.With the heavy administrative workload taken away from him, he said, he will have more time to rest. But even on day one in retirement on Tuesday, Cardinal Njue remained busy with rigid schedules.Efforts to get a face-to-face interview with him failed and even the conversation over the phone got interrupted repeatedly by people he was attending to.""Meeting is very tricky. It is impossible and I can't tell you when I'll be available. If you look at my diary, it is extremely rigid,"" he said.As the interview went on, the cardinal kept his answers short and guarded.""Do the last one because I have many people waiting for my attention,"" he would say.His retirement means he will no longer do administrative work of the archdiocese of Nairobi whose jurisdiction includes Kiambu county.“It is not a resignation,"" he said, explaining that, ""It is a retirement which is guided by Canon Law.""Njue is 76 years old. His retirement as an archbishop is mandatory according to Canon Law that requires that a bishop steps down upon attaining age of 75 years.Upon attaining the mandatory age, the church law requires a bishop or cardinal to send a resignation letter to the Vatican. Njue did this in 2019 when he turned 75 but the Pope only accepted it in 2021.Reflecting on his work, Njue said he has no apology or any regret for his firm stand against decriminalising homosexuality in the country.Njue hit headlines in 2013 when he sharply rejected a call by former US President Barrack Obama for African countries to decriminalise same-sex relations and marriages.The American leader was in Senegal at the time in his inaugural visit to the continent. He had chided African leaders to allow homosexuality in their countries.But Njue, at the time, angrily asserted that Obama should forget about it.“When did I change my mind on those things [gay relations]? I have not changed my mind and I have no apologies,” Njue told the Star.He believes allowing gay relations ruins moral fabric of societies and that it is against the biblical teachings, a stand, he says, he has no apology for.“What God said in the Old Testament about these things [family relations] is very clear. There is no way we can allow those things,” he asserted.He also maintained his vaccine-skeptic stance, asserting that Kenyans should treat foreign-developed vaccines with caution.The foreigners pushing the vaccines in the country always have hidden negative agendas, he said.He, however, said that the Catholic Church was not against vaccines in general but ""only questions their sources"".""When people pretend to be sending help by way of vaccines, you must ask yourself why they are giving it yet they have a hidden agenda,"" he said.""These people have hidden cards under the table.""His sentiments come in the backdrop of the swirling conversation about Covid-19 vaccines that the government announced would start being administered in February.Njue led the church in rejecting government-run and WHO endorsed vaccination drives in 2014 and 2015.Even with him no longer at the helm, he said, the church has a strong institutional policy to guard against ""unhealthy and weird vaccines,"" he said.Edited by Henry Makori"
635,Ex-street boy clothes the poor in city slums,"Samuel Omollo, better known as Omoll, lost his parents aged nine in 1994. And through the intrigues of life, he got into street life, and it took a toll on him.Coupled with peer pressure, he rebelled from the fostering by his aunt, and for a long time, the street would be his abode.Sniffing glue, scavenging garbage at Dandora dumpsite, wearing rugs and living on food alms. This was the life he knew growing up.But Omoll, nicknamed Torres, later fell into the hands of a church and rehabilitation home, which took him to school. He also managed to earn a diploma in journalism.Rehabilitation did not just trigger the thirst for education; it also triggered passion for philanthropy. His work continues to pay off, and in 2020, the Star selected him as one of its persons of the year. In 2013, as he walked through Korogocho slums, he would see women and children in a single outfit day in day out, week after week. Moved by the excruciating poverty in the slums, he felt he could do something to help, though poor and jobless himself.The now 35-year-old father of three started collecting his clothes and those of his wife that they did not need and donating them to the families.After that, he placed a notice at the gate of his estate in Nairobi’s Luckysummer area for neighbours to drop clothes they did not use at his door so he could collect them and distribute.This initiative grew and he called it Mng’aro Mtaani. He later registered it as a philanthropist entity, seeking to dress those not having clothes in the informal settlements.HUMANITARIAN, NOT ACTIVISTWhen he sat down with the Star for an interview just before Christmas, Omoll said he is not an activist but a humanitarian who cannot stomach people struggling yet he can do something about it.“It pained me that women, young children and men are living with limited collections of clothes. It is not that they like it. They genuinely don’t have clothes,” Omoll said.Instead of complaining and whining about the squalor in the slums, Omoll did something about it.Mng’aro mtaani has served close to 40,000 people. Powered with a team of volunteers, Omoll uses Facebook to solicit clothe donations. He has rented a store in Luckysummer for the donations and for over five years now, has gained renown in the major slums in the city.In fact, in seasons of festivities, women troop to his store to get better clothing. “Like now, mothers from Korogocho slums and their children are coming to my house, asking for better clothes for Christmas and to travel upcountry,” he said.And because slum areas remain one of the highly volatile areas during political contests, Mng’aro Mtaani uses clothe donations to foster inter-ethnic coexistence and peace.“When we give the clothes to people of different tribes, we remind them that they were sourced from people of different ethnic groups, so we need to regard one another as brother and sister,” he said. “We call it ‘clothing for peace’.”DIVERSIFIED CHARITYThe entity’s activities have grown diverse, responding to the needs in slums.For example, they collect menstrual towels from well-wishers and donate them to girls in slums under their campaign against gender-based violence.In the Covid-19 season, they have also reached out to the vulnerable with support packages, using social media to solicit donations from the public.“We have no resources of our own. We are only armed with passion to do good and selfless volunteers,” he said.However, real struggle plagues the relentless efforts to do good. The group’s office space and store are staring at the risk of eviction, as they have not paid rent for six months. The volunteers are often given Sh200 for facilitation but since the pandemic struck, this has not been feasible.“I don’t have any earnings. As I help out, my three children are struggling as I don’t have a job. But people think I have money,” he said.Mngaro Mtaani is looking for partners to work with them to help reach as many people as possible.“I’m really hoping organisations such as Safaricom, Telcom among others partner with us so the programme becomes sustainable and we put cheers in the faces of many more people,” he said.The new partnerships, he said, would widen the scope of their reach and touch more lives as well as making the programme sustainable. ""Though I have a diploma, I'm still jobless, but I can make films and videos and edit them. But even more important, I desire a chance to pursue a degree so that my knowledge base, skills and worldview are enlarged to be more effective,"" Omoll said.Though they receive donations in kind, he said he would appreciate cash donations as well to support the various needs of their programmes.""So we can pay the office space, remunerate some staff and professionalise the operations,"" he explained. Edited by T Jalio"
636,Vaccine scramble as state NGOs urge India to lift ban,"Kenya is making a diplomatic push to access the AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine from India, hoping to override the ban on exports.However, Kenya lacks a government-to-government agreement with India since it is relying on the Covax Facility, a vaccine access deal led by Gavi and the World Health Organization.The vaccine is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). India has banned export for several months so that it can stockpile for its own population.Kenya’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is understood to have asked India to relax the ban.Separately, Gavi, the Geneva-based alliance spearheading the Covax Facility, told the Star the only assurance they have is the vaccine will start being shipped around the world by the end of March.Kenya had hoped to receive the first shipment at the end of this month.“Our goal, supported by the Government of India, remains to begin supplying doses in the first quarter of this year so that all countries can have timely and equitable access to vaccines,” a Gavi spokesman told the Star.Covax has an agreement with SII for 200 million doses – with options for as many as 900 million doses more – of either the AstraZeneca or Novavax Covid-19 vaccine candidates.Trials for Novavax are ongoing and it has not been approved anywhere yet.“These are exclusively for lower-income countries supported by the Gavi Covax Advanced Market Commitment,” the spokesman said.Public health experts in Kenya criticised India’s ban, saying it would delay delivery to poor nations.“This news is deeply concerning. It is yet another example of the nationalistic approach by countries worldwide during the pandemic, which will likely further delay access to vaccines in countries like Kenya, and other low income nations,” Rolland Kaya, Médecins Sans Frontières’ humanitarian representative for East and Central Africa, told The Star.He called for a global solidarity approach to ensure equal access to all medicines, vaccines, treatments and innovations for Covid-19.“Governments should act in the interests of people everywhere – the pandemic is not over until it is over for everyone,” he said.The AstraZeneca vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation by the Indian government on Sunday on the condition that SII does not export any shots until the country’s vulnerable populations are protected first.SII is the contracted manufacturer of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and also the sole supplier to Covax.SII CEO Adar Poonawalla on Sunday said the export of vaccines for Covax might not begin until March or April, because of the order by the Indian government.The Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is the preferred vaccine for Kenya because it is cheaper and easier to handle and store.It costs about Sh300 ($3) to Sh400 ($4) per dose, compared to Sh2,550 ($25)-Sh3,700 ($37) a dose for the vaccine developed by Moderna and about Sh2,000 ($20) a dose for Pfizer’s jab, according to figures reported in Europe.(Edited by V.

637,Jubilee denies summoning senator Isaac Mwaura over misconduct,"Jubilee Party on Tuesday dismissed claims that nominated senator Isaac Mwaura has been summoned by the party's disciplinary committee over alleged misconduct.This comes as a notice made rounds on social media claiming that the senator had been summoned to appear before the committee on January 18 over a number of complaints.In the fake notice, Mwaura had been accused of acting disloyal  to the party as well as advancing political positions against the party position.According to the letter, the legislator had demonstrated disrespect to the decisions and organization of Jubilee.Further, Mwaura had been accused of undermining the party leadership by allegedly launching attacks on the party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta.Mwaura who represents Persons with disabilities at the Senate has openly opposed the Building Bridges Initiative which is highly advocated by Uhuru.He termed the BBI report a mockery to PWD’s and special interest groups.According to him, PWD's are angry with the BBI report for scrapping special seats meant for them.Mwaura, said they were very disappointed with the manner the BBI team drafted the amendments to the Constitution.“We have lost representation in the Senate, National Assembly and county assemblies,” he said in November after chairing a meeting."
638,Carrefour owners sue KRA over Sh500 million tax demand,"The owners of Carrefour supermarket have sued Kenya Revenue Authority over Sh500 million tax demand.Majid Al Futtaim Hypermarkets Limited objects to the money being demanded.In 2018, KRA introduced value added tax auto assessment system to detect inconsistencies between purchases and sales invoices declared.The VAA is hosted by KRA’s online filing platform. For example, if a customer buys an item worth Sh10,000 and is charged VAT at the rate of 14 per cent, which is Sh1,400, it is expected  that both the seller and the purchaser shall declare the same as VAT amount.But if the purchaser or seller declares a different amount of VAT then the VAA system picks up the inconsistency and assesses the difference by way of a debit adjustment.The owners of the supermarket chain in November 2019 received various VAA assessments for January 2018 to May 2018. The total was Sh523,009,184Majid Al Futtaim immediately filed its objection to the tax demand and invited KRA to conduct a physical assessment.Its objection was based on the fact that the implementation of VAA effectively places an obligation on the supermarket to ensure its suppliers declare output VAT and remit the same to KRA, which it said contravenes tax laws.Secondly, it said the inconsistency between the input tax claimed by KRA and the output tax declared by the supplier does not necessarily imply noncompliance or tax leakage.And since November 15, 2019, KRA has not rendered a decision on the objection raised by the supermarket owners, while the principal tax assessment amounts continue to reflect and accrue interest.KRA is now accused of contravening the right to fair administrative action, which in turn has placed a burden on the supermarket owners to account for failures that may be attributed to the suppliers, the court was told.They want the court to declare the implementation of VAA an illegality because it shifts the burden to supermarket owner to demonstrate that tax has been paid by suppliers.Also sought is an order to compel KRA to credit the supermarket owner’s iTax ledger with Sh583,795,501 for the input tax claimed.KRA has yet to respond as it has not been served with suit papers. The case comes up for directions on February 9."

640,Clinical officers threaten to resume strike after deal falls through,"Cinical officers have threatened to resume their strike should their return to work formula remain unsigned in full in the next 48 hours.The union SG George Gibore has accused the council of governors of being insincere and unrealistic by saying that the return to work formula be signed at individual counties yet acknowledge the ongoing conciliation at the Ministry of Labour.The clinicians had called off their strike on Friday last week but the agreement remains unsigned by the CoG, with the union now saying the grievances they were fighting for remain unresolved despite calling off the strike.""The letter by the CoG is an admission that health services are not properly coordinated in our country since devolution and needs an emergency surgery to cure the unending health sector problems,"" KUCO SG George Gibore said on Tuesday.""""The CoG is living in denial that individual counties have failed in management of the HRH since devolution leading to more than 103 strikes since 2013 to date.""The CoG on Monday bolted out of the return to work formula signed by the doctors union claiming the counties have no money to implement the agreement."
641,Court drama over Anne Kananu deputy governor nomination case,"The High Court will on Thursday determine whether it will allow a Nairobi voter to be enjoined in a case challenging the nomination of Anne Mwendwa Kananu as the Deputy Governor (DG). The matter was listed for directions on Monday but Justice Grace Nzioka said parties in the case did not delve on enjoinment of Josephat Ngendo but on an order that seeks to suspend the gazette notice issued by the independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) calling for the Nairobi gubernatorial by-election.""My direction is that we are unlikely to be discussing suspending the by-election when the Interested Party has not been enjoined in the case. We should have dealt with the prayer seeking enjoinment of Ngendo and IEBC before arguing on the gazette notice that’s calling for the by-elections,” she told parties in the case. Ngendo filed an application in court on December 23 seeking to be enjoined in the case challenging Mwendwa’s nomination as DG. He also sought to have the IEBC enjoined and an order stopping the Nairobi county assembly from vetting Kananu lifted. Also sought in his application was an order to suspend the Gazette notice calling for the Nairobi gubernatorial by-election slated for 18 February.  But as the case was proceeding before Judge Nzioka, a different court issued orders stopping the by-election. The matter before Nzioka had been going on since morning. Parties were to come for directions but the session turned into arguments of representation, allegations of mischief, conspiracy and later a request by Peter Agoro to withdraw his case.  Agoro who was present during the proceedings was even forced to provide his National Identity card to prove he is the petitioner in the case. He also told the court that he does not know a lawyer by the name C.N Ongoto who was purporting to represent him in the case. The court was informed that there had been a change of advocates representing Agoro with the new Lawyer going by the name Guandaru Theuri. The issue of representation became a heated argument especially after Ongoto said there was mischief on the part of some parties in the case. This forced the Judge to adjourn the matter from 12:30 to 2pm. When the court reconvened, Theuri and Ongoto had still not resolved the issue of representation. It was only settled after Theuri said his client has never met Ongoto and he has since filed a complaint. The Judge then proceeded to deal with the main issues before court. She said Ngendo cant seek to have the IEBC enjoined in the case when he himself is not a party. As she was giving her directions, Ngendo’s lawyer interjected saying the court had not heard him regarding his application for joinder. “Im sorry but the impression I got this morning was that the court had been cleared,” said the Judge. But even before the Judge could go any further, Theuri interjected saying his client Agoro had instructed him to withdraw the case. But Nzioka declined to entertain him saying she will first deal with the application by Ngendo seeking enjoinment in the Mwenda case. After submissions were made, the Judge directed the parties to appear in court today for the ruling."
642,We shall oppose plans to remove Kang'ata as Chief Whip - Murkomen,"Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen now says he will oppose any plans to remove Senator Irungu Kang'ata from his powerful position of Majority Chief Whip.Murkomen said they if the Jubilee Party Leadership calls for a meeting to remove Kang'ata, they shall attend the meeting and oppose the move.""If Jubilee Party Leadership calls for a meeting to remove Majority Whip @HonKangata we shall attend the meeting and vehemently oppose his ejection,"" Murkomen said.He said instead they will remove non-party members and replace them with party members.""It doesn’t matter what he did to Susan Kihika and I, we shall oppose his removal,"" he said.His sentiments come after Kang'ata wrote a controversial letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta indicating that the BBI referendum was not popular in the central region.Kang'ata warned that as a result, the proposed BBI referendum faces a ""spectacular defeat"" in the region.The letter which has triggered political suspicion in Raila’s camp has also rocked a major split Mt Kenya backyard that now threatens to scuttle the Building Bridges Initiative.Though Senator Kang'ata apologised saying the letter was leaked to the media, President Uhuru Kenyatta's allies have claimed Deputy President William Ruto is the hand behind the political turmoil—including the letter.On Monday Kang'ata was disowned by powerful Mt Kenya leaders, including the region's 10 governors.National Assembly Majority leader Amos Kimunya trashed Kang'ata’s move as “careless and immature” and alleged it’s a plot by the Ruto political axis to turn the tide against the BBI.“If you read the letter, it is what has been the position of Karen [Ruto's official residence] on the BBI. I even doubt whether the senator is the sole author of the letter,” the Kipipiri MP told the Star.“I wouldn’t want to judge him, but his actions and content of the letter seem to be an extension of Karen. That was a very careless attempt to attract the attention of the boss by purporting to write a letter to him and copying it to the media. That is totally immature.”The feeling in the Kenyatta camp is that Kang’ata could be preparing to follow nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura to the Ruto camp.However, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua on Tuesday said Kang'ata’s letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta on his perspective of BBI support in Mt. Kenya region may be the best thing to happen to the Building Bridges Initiative.""What the courageous Senate Majority Chief Whip has done is vocalized the whispers that have been going on due to propaganda by opposers of BBI,"" Mutua said.""By speaking about the challenges as he sees them, he has issued a call to arms which has now made the BBI issue and its success, especially in Mt. Kenya region, an issue of debate and hopefully, action.""The governor said he was pleased that no less than 10 of his fellow governors issued a statement over the letter.""They have said all will be well and I am sure they will now, more than before, ensure all will indeed be well. That is good for BBI,"" Mutua said."
643,US Republican vows to carry gun to Congress,"A newly-elected congresswoman has pledged to carry a Glock handgun during her term in Washington DC.In a video released on Sunday, Republican Lauren Boebert is shown loading a handgun before walking around the city.""I will carry my firearm in DC and in Congress,"" she says in the video, which has been viewed over two million times.But the city's police chief has said he plans to speak to Ms Boebert about the strict rules on carrying firearms.Ms Boeber owns a restaurant called Shooters Grill in the town of Rifle, Colorado, where members of staff are encouraged to openly carry weapons, as is permitted under the state's laws.The issue of gun rights formed a key part of her campaign for last November's election.""Even though I now work in one of the most liberal cities in America, I refuse to give up my rights,"" Ms Boebert says in the video posted on Twitter on Sunday.""So as a five-foot-tall, 100-pound woman I choose to protect myself legally because I am my best security.""But police were quick to respond, with Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee III telling reporters: ""That Congresswoman will be subjected to the same penalties as anyone else that's caught on the DC streets carrying a firearm.""While the US constitution enshrines the people's right to keep and bear arms, the rules governing this vary.Members of Congress are allowed to keep firearms in their offices and transport them in Washington DC, as long as they are not loaded.However, a permit is needed to carry a gun through the city's streets and weapons from other states must first be registered with local authorities.Last month, a group of Democratic senators proposed new legislation to tighten existing rules for members of Congress."
644,Central African President Touadéra wins re-election,"The President of the Central African Republic, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, has been re-elected after securing nearly 54% of the votes.The electoral commission said the results made a second-round runoff unnecessary.Former Prime Minister, Anicet George Pologuele, finished a distant second with just 21% of the votes, while Martin Ziguele finished third with 7% of the votes.There were a total of 16 candidates running for president - including three women.Opposition candidates have said the election was riddled with massive irregularities.The vote took place despite an offensive by a coalition of armed rebel groups which left thousands unable to cast their ballots.The government has accused the former President François Bozizé, who was barred from standing in the poll, of staging an attempted coup.He's denied the allegations but said he supported the rebels.Prosecutors have launched an investigation, accusing Mr Bozizé of acts of destabilisation and rebellion."
645,Muthama yet to take charge of 'Ruto’s wheelbarrow party',"Political heavyweights associated with Deputy President William Ruto are yet to take charge of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) as its officials, the Star has established.Former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama had claimed chairmanship of the party believed to be the DP’s vehicle in the coming 2022 elections.Muthama even promised to make finer details of the party on January 7.But according to Registrar of Political Parties (RPP) Ann Nderitu, PDR has not changed its officials but is only in the process of changing its name and symbols.“UDA is PDR that changed its name, it is not really a new party and the process of name change is still on,” Nderitu said on phone.She added: “The officials of PDR are the same for UDA unless they change.”Last month, the office of the Registrar gave notice of intention by the PDR to change its name to UDA, a move that raising speculation that the DP camp was plotting to embrace the party as his vehicle for the election.In the gazette notice, the party also sought to change its symbol from a bull to a wheelbarrow with Kazi Ni Kazi as its slogan.“In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 20 (i) of the Political Parties Act, the Registrar of Political Parties gives notice that the Party for Reforms and Development (PDR) intends to effect changes on their particulars,” reads the gazette notice in part.The wheelbarrow has been the face of the hustler nation empowerment programme headed by the DP that has attracted a lot of criticism from supporters of the Building Bridges Initiative who have accused the DP of waging class wars in the country.PDR was initially Party of Action (POA) founded by Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju in the run-up to 2013 elections.It later teamed up with Kenya National Congress (KNC) to form the Eagle Alliance and supported Peter Kenneth as the presidential candidate in the 2013 polls."
646,Hope for patients as nurses' union meets Labour CS,"Government and the nurses' union on Monday started another round of talks in efforts to unlock the ongoing stalemate.Union officials and Labour CS Simon Chelugui held a conciliatory meeting. It is hoped an agreement will be reached by Wednesday.Nurses have been on strike since December 7, with several meetings to end the boycott proving unsuccessful. They are demanding provision of quality and standard PPE, comprehensive medical cover, risk allowance, hiring of more healthcare workers and dedicated health facilities in each county for those who contract Covid-19 while on duty.So far, 34 have succumbed to the virus in the line of duty.Doctors and clinical officers called off their strike on December 24 and January 1, but healthcare services remain paralysed in hospitals countrywide.Nurses comprise 80 per cent of the healthcare system, hence, the paralysis.As a result, many poor Kenyans who cannot afford services in private hospitals continue to bear the brunt of the strike.“The nurses are the hospitals; the nurses are the healthcare system. We are the central nervous system of the hospital and there is no hospital that can function when the central nervous system has broken down,” KNUN secretary general Seth Panyako said.Speaking to the Star on the phone, Panyako said he was optimistic that a lasting solution might be found before the end of the week.“We will be drafting our minimal demands and giving them to the Ministry of Labour. If they will be in agreement with us, then we are prepared to sign them immediately,” he said.The union has threatened to withdraw services in the country's two major referral hospitals—Kenyatta National Hospital and the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital—from Thursday should the talks fail.“We have looked at the steps so far taken and we give them [government] an extension of three days because the impact of the industrial action is being felt,” Panyako said.He said nurses will not go back to work until the government produces evidence on the medical cover provided by each county. He said only nurses in counties that have met the demands will be allowed to resume duty.“We want to be told those nurses who have died when the medical cover is not in place, what happens to them? What about those nurses who are admitted in hospital, they have died and we have contributed to pay their medical bills? We want those monies we have paid in those hospitals to be refunded and given to the families left behind,” Panyako said.He said the union had agreed to lower the amount of risk allowance demanded from Sh30,000 to Sh20,000.Edited by Josephine M.

647,ODM major revamp plans unveiled,"Raila Odinga's ODM party has laid down plans to revitalise the outfit amid concerns of dwindling fortunes.This is an indication that the Orange party may not be ready to play subservient to other political forces in next year's presidential duel.Under the plan, ODM will convene a retreat for all its elected leaders as it rolls out a massive offensive to protect its territories from Deputy President William Ruto's Tangatanga camp forays.Despite his falling-out with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Ruto's political resurgence appears to be shaking up ODM's most loyal strongholds.The Star has established that Raila will in three weeks' time chair a meeting of the National Governing Council to rejuvenate the party. The meeting will focus on a fightback plan against Ruto.The NGC meeting is expected to approve proposals by the party's National Executive Council to hold regional delegates meetings to fill vacant leadership positions at the grassroots.At least eight regional delegates meetings have been lined up for about two months starting March, with the NDC likely to be held by June to pick new national office bearers.The NGC meeting will unveil the NDC roadmap for the party's national elections - the first of its kind after the infamous 'men in black' bungled the 2014 polls following a bitter falling out.The Registrar of Political Parties has advised parties that are yet to hold internal elections due to Covid-19 to prepare to do so virtually starting next month.Parties are obliged to comply with their own constitutions and the law of the land by conducting periodic internal elections.Jubilee and ODM are among parties grappling with fears of being declared non-compliant with the law if they fail to hold their elections that were due last year.ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna dismissed claims the party had convened crisis talks, saying such meetings were part of the ongoing process to strengthen the party.“We are getting back to normalcy in full swing,” Sifuna said.There have been concerns that ODM is slowly losing grip on its porous political strongholds in Western Kenya and the Coast following sustained incursions by Ruto, a 2022 presidential front-runner.Some of Raila's allies say there is an urgent need to ward off further forays by the DP into perceived ODM strongholds if the party is to remain a formidable player in next year's polls.In the upcoming NGC meeting, ODM elected governors, senators, MPs and county assembly leaders will review the party's performance in the last three years and revise its 2022 strategies.Last month, ODM lost in the Msambweni MP by-election. In the poll, Ruto-backed independent candidate Faisal Bader defeated ODM's Omar Boga. The defeat rattled ODM’s dominance at the Coast.But Sifuna, the ODM spokesman, said the party has already done its postmortem on the Msambweni by-election and picked great lessons that would inform future political battles.“We cannot focus on a race that is already finished. We have picked ourselves up and are ready to face the next battles in Nairobi and Matungu, which we will win,” he said.In what is seen as a deliberate campaign to reclaim its lost glory, ODM will soon roll out countrywide campaigns to popularise the party in preparation for the 2022 General Election.ODM director of elections Junet Mohamed on Sunday said the party will fight tooth and nail to vanquish Tangatanga from its strongholds even as he laughed off reports of dwindling fortunes.“We are going to fight with Tangatanga openly now. We want to come back forcefully as ODM through a scorched-earth campaign,” Junet said."
648,Njue: Cardinal who chided Obama over gay rights,"“Let him forget, forget and forget.”John Cardinal Njue was reacting to US President Barrack Obama in June 2013 after the American leader called for better treatment of the LGBTQ community while in Senegal. Njue, the immediate former head of the Catholic Church in Kenya, said Africans must be allowed to determine their own destiny, including on gay rights, which he called unAfrican and a violation of Bible teachings.“... [the] United States has ruined their own societies… I don’t think God was making a mistake when he created Adam and Eve and told them what to do,” he said.Njue was a fierce defender of conservative family values, a mission that put him on a collision course with the powerful. He considered it his job to give them his truth, which he considered to be THE truth.. Pope Francis accepted Cardinal Njue's resignation on Monday. He had passed the mandatory retirement age of 75 as required by the canon law that guides the Roman Catholic Church.Njue has stepped down as the head of the Nairobi Diocese, but he remains a cardinal until the age of 80. He led the diocese since 2007. The Vatican said in a statement the Pope had appointed Nairobi Auxiliary Bishop David Kamau as the Apostolic Administrator of Nairobi Archdiocese. Back in 2013, Cardinal Njue's chiding of Obama received pushback from Charles Daniel Balvo, another Pope-appointed official of the Catholic Church in Kenya. “The homosexuals should be defended against violation of their dignity and human rights, they are human beings like any one of us,” Balvo, the Apostolic Nuncio to Kenya at the time, told a Catholic assembly.A year after the spat with Obama, Cardinal Njue led Catholic bishops to reject a government-led and  WHO-endorsed anti-tetanus vaccination drive. The jab exclusively targeted women of reproductive ages of 14 to 49. The bishops were concerned that the drive only targeted fertile women, suggesting it was a population control plot to inhibit fertilityThey said an independent test of the vaccine sample had found that it contained beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, a birth control hormone. They urged Kenyans to boycott the jab. Further in 2015, Njue led the church in rejecting a polio vaccination drive carried out by the Ministry of Health and sponsored by Unicef and WHO. The vaccine had been found to be contaminated when it was administered on children in Nigeria, they claimed.The government said the jab was safe as it was manufactured by the WHO. The state told the public to ignore the church.But Njue dug in, insisting that the government should have subjected it to independent testing to ensure safety. ""Kenyans must be the ones determining their own destiny as not everything coming from outside the country is safe,"" Njue said. In June 2017, during the celebration of Family Day, Njue slammed men who demand hefty bride prices from their daughters' suitors. In defence of the family unit, he argued that such men ""put roadblocks in the way of marriages by making exorbitant demands for payment from the groom's family"".In 2019, Njue again led the church's bishops to reject policies discussed during the ICPD25, a global UNFPA summit held in Nairobi to discuss reproductive health rights. Born in Embu in 1944, Njue was ordained a priest in 1973 in Rome before returning to the country the following year to embark on his ministry work in Kariakomu in Meru. He also taught philosophy at the National Seminary of Bungoma where he later served as the head from 1978 to 1982. Njue was appointed the Bishop of Embu in 1986 and served as president of the Kenyan Episcopal Conference from 1997 to 2003.He was later installed the Bishop of Nyeri and also served as the Apostolic Administrator of Isiolo from 2005-06.(edited by o. owino)"
649,Uhuru allies see Ruto's hidden hand in perceived Mt Kenya rebellion,"A major split has rocked President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Mt Kenya backyard that now threatens to scuttle the Building Bridges Initiative and the camaraderie with ODM leader Raila Odinga.Uhuru’s allies have claimed Deputy President William Ruto is the hand behind the political turmoil—including the letter by Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata in which he warned that the proposed BBI referendum faces ""spectacular defeat"" in the region.But the letter has also triggered political suspicion in Raila’s camp that it could be testing ground by some influential individuals to completely abandon the BBI process.On Monday, however, Kang'ata was disowned by powerful Mt Kenya leaders, including the region's 10 governors.National Assembly Majority leader Amos Kimunya trashed Kang'ata’s move as “careless and immature” and alleged it’s a plot by the Ruto political axis to turn the tide against the BBI.“If you read the letter, it is what has been the position of Karen [Ruto's official residence] on the BBI. I even doubt whether the senator is the sole author of the letter,” the Kipipiri MP told the Star.“I wouldn’t want to judge him, but his actions and content of letter seem to be an extension of Karen. That was a very careless attempt to attract attention of the boss by purporting to write a letter to him and copying it to the media. That is totally immature.”The feeling in the Kenyatta camp is that Kang’ata could be preparing to follow nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura to the Ruto camp.Mwaura, a vocal legislator, recently defected to Tangatanga and viciously attacked the Kenyatta and Moi families for holding onto power for more than 50 years.On January 2, Kandara MP Alice Wahome launched a scathing attack on Uhuru and dismissed him as a failed president.In his letter that is music to the Ruto camp, Kang'ata said the BBI is unpopular and has approximately 10 per cent support in Mt Kenya.He also wants no use of provincial administrators, a multiple-question referendum and Jubilee to bend backwards in dealing with rebels.A multiple-question referendum has been one of Ruto’s key demands.There are questions as to why Kang'ata, a connected lawmaker in the Jubilee ranks, chose to address the President through an open letter and not through official channels.Weeks before the BBI signatures were handed to the IEBC, Kang'ata was purportedly leading the Uhuru faction for a consensus with the Ruto axis on contentious BBI proposals.Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni told the Star that Kang'ata’s move is “tactics of a person on the brink of defection.”“He is looking for a reason to defect to Tangatanga. As the Majority Whip, he has access to the President 24/7, hence has no justification for what he did,” Kioni said.“Such behaviour is in keeping with a weak person. I am disappointed with such an approach. He is quick to look at why the BBI should fail. We even think it may have been a mistake to pick him Senate whip,” the MP said.“When as general you are the first one to throw in the towel and punch holes on the balloon, that is betrayal, not even dishonesty, of the ordinary Kenyans.”Jubilee Party secretary general Raphael Tuju also dismissed Kang'ata’s claims that the BBI is unpopular in the region “There would be no political significance [of his survey] if there are questions over methodology, sample size and validity of the study results,” he told the Star.Following the development, there is a feeling in ODM camp that President Kenyatta might not be fully committed to the BBI and that Raila could be abandoned.Homa Bay MP Peter Kaluma, in a tweet that he hurriedly deleted, sounded the alarm of imminent betrayal. He said the letter was not the senator’s “handwriting”.“We are not welded to anyone. Let no one blackmail us! We've seen it all. We're suicidal. We'll be Solomon if you play wise with us; we can be Samson if you play games with us,” read the tweet, which the lawmaker later claimed was about the 2022 Homa Bay governor race.When contacted, he said: “We are with Uhuru to the end. Once you make your bed, you must lie in it.”Even so, fears abound that Kang’ata is no ordinary leader to author such a letter and circulate it to that extent.“If you see such a letter, the next thing they will say is that they [Mt Kenya] have listened to the voice of the people and have thus decided to shelve the BBI process,” a high-ranking ODM member told the Star in confidence.But 10 Mt Kenya governors in a press statement termed the senator's remarks as “irresponsible, cheap and populist”. “To intimate that the Mt Kenya region is opposed to the document at this stage is not only preposterous but also a serious misrepresentation of facts and reality and, we repeat, very premature,” they said.The governors want the top Jubilee leadership to coordinate the BBI political actors. They said Kang'ata’s statement should be deemed as personal and based on personal prejudices.They county chiefs are Francis Kimemia (Nyandarua), Kiraitu Murungi (Meru), Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru), Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga), James Nyoro (Kiambu), Martin Wambora (Embu), Ndiritu Muriithi (Laikipia), Mwangi wa Iria (Murang'a), Muthomi Njuki (Tharaka Nithi) and Mutahi Kahiga (Nyeri)“Kang'ata should have followed official government structures in his address to the President. Such breach of protocol is unacceptable. It raises questions why a senior member of the government leadership in Parliament would choose this cheap populist method to address this issue.”ODM political affairs secretary Opiyo Wandayi described the move as one that is “unhealthy from a political perspective”.“I suppose if the advisory is genuine or authentic, it should have been confidential and the President would be the one to choose whether to share it with other people or not.“The issues raised could be pertinent but the manner they are presented raises more questions than answers,” the Ugunja MP said.But Ruto allies came to Kang'ata’s defence, with Nyeri Deputy Governor Caroline Karugu saying the senator was only reporting his survey findings.“Some not too smart folks are fighting him. Like the proverbial ostrich, they remain dead to the realities on the ground,” she said.Soy MP Caleb Kositany said in a tweet: “This (the letter) is most welcome. I just hope Hon Kang'ata is not in trouble.”The DP’s people say the success of the referendum in Mt Kenya will depend on the character of the people selling the document.But the BBI proponents, in terms of whether Central supports BBI or not, hold that they have been on the ground and know there are people who support the process.Edited by Henry Makori"
650,Freedom fighters dying poor after risking lives for Kenya,"One may judge the Mau Mau for the killings and atrocities they committed, but they are equally up in arms over misrule and neglect decades after Independence in 1963.Interviews with surviving members and supporters in Meru found they are no longer proud of the fight to gain Independence. They did not anticipate that after kicking out colonialists by hook or by crook, they would be left suffering while the nation reels under poor governance and corruption.The Mau Mau movement, which emerged in the 1950s, was the militant wing of a growing clamour for political representation and freedom in Kenya. Wikipedia notes that the first attempt to form a countrywide political party began on October 1, 1944. The Mau Mau rebellion that led to a State of Emergency being declared was heavily dominated by the Kikuyu people as well as the Meru and the Embu.The capture of rebel leader Field Marshal Dedan Kimathi on October 21, 1956, signalled the defeat of the Mau Mau. The rebellion, however, survived until after Kenya's independence from Britain, driven mainly by the Meru units, led by Field Marshal Musa Mwariama and Gen Baimungi.Baimuingi, one of the last Mau Mau generals, was killed shortly after Kenya attained self-rule.Looking back, Mau Mau fighter brigadier Joseph Mwenda, 85, feels they have been short-changed and the country as a whole betrayed.“We are seeing a reverse of what we fought for, a country run in total disregard of law, selfish leaders and corruption,” he said.LEFT TO OWN DEVICESMwenda, the brigadier to the late Field Marshal Musa Mwariama, fought for freedom alongside Mwariama, who hailed from Lubuathirua in Muthara location, Tigania East constituency.He spoke to the Star at his home in Kithithina, besides the cold ranges of Mt Kenya Forest. Mwenda said he has never benefitted from any government kitty or promised property, despite his sacrifice for the nation.He urged the county and national governments to freely enrol the fighters on the National Health Insurance Fund.“I was admitted in ICU in Embu after a stroke paralysed me. I thought I could never regain my memory. My family catered for the hospital bills. Is this the independence I fought for?” he asked.“My message to Uhuru: the promise for Mau Mau fighters has never been fulfilled.”Mwenda said a judge had sentenced Mwariama to five years in jail, which further angered Mau Mau warriors, who swore to continue with killings until his release unless they all die.“Luckily we were summoned by Jomo Kenyatta in Nairobi and Mwariama was released. He had served one and half years in jail,” he said.“We came out of the forest with a promise from Kenyatta we would be given land. I and others settled in the highlands of Mt Kenya after all other parts were already occupied by those who were not in the forest.” Then Lands minister Harvester Angaine gave them land but not for free. It was issued as a loan they repaid over the next 30 years, Mwenda said.“The Kenyatta government succeeded by Arap Moi never helped us. We were referred to as criminals,” he said with bitterness.Mwenda is always glued to radio and TV stations in the hope that the President will one day recognise his sacrifice and invite him for honours.WAR ON WHITESMwenda recalled how they drank the brains of white settlers (colonialists) to mark an oath of loyalty and determination for Independence.He said fighters used beautiful girls to entice, get intelligence and penetrate white’s camps to actualise their mission of killing.“The white man had powerful sniffer dogs and well-trained soldiers. We were slaves in our own land,” Mwenda said.“Those of us who had participated in World War 1 trained the rest to use guns we stole from whites’ police stations. We utilised our wisdom and tricks to manoeuvre their territories and killed many.”Mwenda said in 1952, when Kenyatta and others were arrested, the fighters vowed to revenge.“The whites feared Kikuyu, Meru and Embu because they were relentless in the war. Some communities assimilated and others betrayed us in the war,” he said.“We had a long journey of eight years in the forest, shifting from Nyambene, Nyaga, Nyandarua and Mt Kenya. The whites killed many of us, thinking it was Mwariama. Mwariama was tall, big, gentle and fearless. He got the name Mwariama after he told his colleagues he must knock down and kill the strongest white who was perceived the worst, and he killed him.”Mwariama’s son Joel Mwariama concurred with Mwenda, pleading with President Uhuru Kenyatta to consider the families of Mau Mau heroes.He said his father was a committed warrior who never looked back until the nation was free from colonialists, but the freedom fighters suffer poverty, poor roads and lack of jobs for their children.“They wasted their productive time in forests. President Uhuru Kenyatta announced at Timau to recognise fighters' families. If Raila (Odinga, former Prime minister) can receive millions from the government, why can’t our families benefit?” Joel said.“My father died a poor man. We witness hatred, tribalism and rampant corruption that has robbed the nation of the fighters' core mandate and commitment.”BLACKS ALSO KILLEDMwenda said they had trusted elders in every district to monitor and help them recruit able young men, and those who refused were equally killed.“In any war, killing is not a sin because we killed the enemy,"" he said.The freedom fighter married in his 40s because they had no time for women while in the forest.“God was with us. When we prayed, our prayers were answered instantly. If you pray, pray without jokes or ceasing,” Mwenda advised.He laughed off youths of nowadays for what he termed their cowardice and lust for money and quick acquisition of wealth.Mwenda hailed Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s announcement to name some Meru streets after Field Marshal Musa Mwariama and Baimungi as a great step, but said they need monetary recognition and jobs for Mau Mau children.“Does Kiraitu know the family of Mwariama and I and other Mau Mau warriors have never benefitted? Most fighters were loaned very small land portions in Timau and near Mt Kenya forest. Some of us were shot, others hanged fighting for Independence, but their families are living in abject poverty,"" he said.Mwenda said county and national governments verbally recognise freedom fighters and promise their families heaven but they die without a coin.M’Muthuri wa M’Nturimbitu recalled how his mediation skills during crises earned him the nickname 'Brake'.“I only get Sh1,000, whereas my wives and children do not get a single coin. I was in Baimungi’s soldier’s camp. I ask the government to identify the living fighters and give them stipends,” he said.“The land I occupy  was on loan. If one never paid, you were evicted. What is my family proud of in the government we fought for?”Mukuunga Liili from Kiambogo near Mt Kenya Forest lamented living in poverty despite being an informer and cooking for the Mau Mau fighters.“Our children never got a chance for education. No modern shelter. It is painful for us to live in poverty like hyenas in the forest,” she said.Agnes Karuki said she feels like cursing the government for the wanton corruption and poor leadership exhibited in the country.""We don’t see the real leadership we demanded. There is corruption and little tangible developments reach mwananchi,” she said.Edited by T Jalio"
651,"Why Mau Mau cut ears, lips of traitors","Writing legend Prof Ngugi wa Thiong’o, in the novel 'The river between', stated, ""The oilskin of the house is not for rubbing into the skin of strangers."" This captures why the Mau Mau never tolerated traitors.Nkirang’a Mutiria, 74, from Kithiori, Tharaka Nithi county, shared his experience with the Star on how so many men and women were wounded, some tortured, others castrated and others shot dead after some Kenyans gave information on the whereabouts of freedom fighters and their supporters to the colonialists.Mutiria said while he ran for safety from the colonialists' sympathisers hunting to kill him, he became a permanently disabled person after a thorn injury, which led to the cutting of his leg.Mutiria, who mentioned some of the traitors, wished such betrayal could never happen again in any country. He said it was a must for every Mau Mau person to take an oath that was administered by revered men. The oath meant you would never betray your country’s loyalty or share any secrets of the elders with a third party.Mutiria said once one was discovered to have revealed any information, they were presented in a secret place, where their ears and lips were slashed. Some traitors were also killed.""I joined Mau Mau in 1956. I took the oath at Ciothirai in North Imenti. As I was escaping [from colonialists' sympathisers], I jumped over and stepped on a thorn that destroyed my life,"" he said.""We were dedicated to fight for Independence but today, it is no longer the freedom we fought for. I now live a very vulnerable life as a disabled person from the time my leg became a limp.""Mutiria pleaded with leaders to be mindful of the elderly and youths who are languishing in poverty. He said he was among the people who were registered to benefit from the British compensation to Mau Mau fighters, but no coin has ever reached him.Agnes Karuki said they used to share the little available on the table. “You could not eat alone. We had to share the little we had, including one bean, because the oath worked wonders,” she said.Mau Mau veteran Joseph Mwenda, who was Musa Mwariama’s brigadier, said they had trusted elders in every district to monitor and help them recruit able young men, and those who refused were killed.“In any war, killing is not a sin because we killed the enemy. We could also cut off one’s lips and ears when we got information you shared Mau Mau secrets.”Mwenda said the whites feared Kikuyus, Merus and Embus because they were relentless in the war. He said chopping off ears was a sign their ears do not listen to what should be adhered to and their mouths are a betrayal to what should not be known to strangers.“Some communities assimilated them (colonialists) and others betrayed us in the war. We had a long journey of eight years in the forest, shifting from Nyambene, Nyaga, Nyandarua and Mt Kenya,” he said.“The whites killed many of us thinking it was Mwariama. Only one soldier, a traitor, could vividly identify Mwariama because they were circumcised the same day.”Mwenda recalled how they drank the brains of the white settlers (colonialists) to mark an oath of loyalty and determination for Independence.Edited by T Jalio"
652,Cedar destruction lands KFS official in trouble,"The Kenya Forest Service has interdicted an officer linked to illegal logging of an endangered cedar tree.Cedar is the most targeted tree species. The durable and beautiful wood is moisture-resistant, decay-resistant and insect repellent.KFS in a statement on Monday said Chief Conservator of Forest Julius Kamau ordered interdiction after receiving a report from a rapid response team.The team, KFS said, was recently deployed to the Sachangwan beat, Koibatek station in Baringo county to verify information on illegal logging from members of the public.The rapid response team of KFS security officers proposed immediate corrective actions.KFS said the team established an indigenous cedar tree species (Juniperus procera) had been felled and split into about 70 posts.The recovered posts were moved to rapid response base in Kibunja.CCF Kamau directed immediate interdiction of the officer involved pending  investigations to establish if any other individuals were involved in the crime.Kamau said cedar is an endangered species and its protection shall not be compromised.The CCF said the crime was also under probe by the National Police Service and booked at Molo police station.Kamau emphasised that the duty of forest officers is to protect forest resources. He said any officers abetting forest destruction shall face serious administrative action under law.Kamau thanked members of the public for reporting suspicious forest activities and said credible reports will be thoroughly investigated and corrective measures taken.In February 2018, the government appointed a taskforce to look into forest resources management and logging activities. It reported on April 30.The report said the KFS board and management had been unable to stem and in some instances directly participated in, abetted and systemised rampant corruption and abuse of office.""By so doing they have overseen wanton destruction of our forests, have systematically executed plunder and pillaging of our water towers and bear the responsibility for bringing our environment to the precipice,"" the taskforce said.It examined scale of illegal logging, destruction, degradation and encroachment of public and community forests, water towers and other catchment areas and associated impacts.The taskforce said KFS has institutionalised corruption and the system is replete with deep-rooted corrupt practices, lack of accountability and unethical behaviour.The taskforce also cited dedicated officers who served the country under difficult circumstances. In some cases they have been victimised by cartels, it said.Illegal logging of indigenous trees is a major threat to forests and is rampant in key forest areas.Destruction of indigenous forests is due to illegal squatters, the changing lifestyle of forest dwelling communities, the abuse of plantation schemes,  unclear forest zones, the introduction of irregular settlements and large-scale public infrastructure developments.(Edited by V.

653,"Two bodies retrieved, one missing in Lake Baringo","Two bodies – those of a man and a baby – were retrieved on Monday from flooded Lake Baringo after an overloaded speed boat capsized.The accident occurred on Saturday at 3.30pm. The water safety chairman blamed the accident on overloading and said the brakes were applied abruptly.Baringo South subcounty police commander Benjoliffe Munuve said the body of 30-year-old businessman Ken Komen and one-and-a-half-year-old Cara Kipsang were retrieved on Monday morning.“The divers are still struggling to find the body of 15-year old Jill Akinyi, a Form 2 girl at Lake Bogoria Girls High School,” he said.Munuve said 12 people were on board, including family members on an expedition from Kampi Samaki town to Teddy Bear Hotel on Kokwa Island.He said divers from Lake Baringo assisted police to retrieve the bodies.Five victims were rescued immediately, four swam to safety but three were missing.Bogoria Girls High School principal Jean Ngaywa condoled with Jill's family.Lake Baringo Water Rescue and Safety International chairman Joshua Chepsergon blamed the accident on the weight of the vessel, saying it was overloaded.“The coxswain accidentally applied the emergency brakes sharply when he approached the island and then it scooped water, which made the boat capsize,” he said.Chepsergon said due to the waves, overwhelming water levels and darkness, the divers were unable to dive deep on Saturday evening. They resumed on Sunday morning.It was the latest in a number of accidents over the years; at least 11 people drowned.In 2004, the headmaster of Nairobi's Hospital Hill School and seven parents died when their boat capsized after a storm.The same year, a tour guide drowned during a swimming expedition at Devil's Island.An academic tour turned tragic in 2011 after two students of Comboni Youth Polytechnic in Gilgil drowned.One of the students slipped and fell into the swollen lake, his colleague drowned while attempting to rescue him. (Edited by V.

654,Court suspends Nairobi governor by-election,"Impeached Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Monday got a reprieve in his quest to overturn his removal after the court barred the IEBC from conducting a by-election.Justice Antony Mrima suspended the special Gazette notice issued by the IEBC last month calling for a by-election to replace Sonko.The judge ruled the by-election is suspended pending the hearing and determination of the application by Sonko, who argues that procedures were violated, hence, the impeachment is null and void.""The special Gazette Notice No. 10914 dated December 21, 2020, issued by the IEBC be and is hereby suspended until the hearing and determination of the amended Notice of Motion,” the order reads.The case will be mentioned on January 14 for hearing of the application.Sonko challenged his removal from office, claiming due process was violated. He argued he will suffer snots ouster from office.Sonko argued that he will suffer irreparable damage not compensable in monetary terms because he stands to lose his position as the second governor of the city without due process of the law.Through lawyer Wilfred Nyamu, Sonko wants the court to bar the IEBC from holding a by-election. He faulted the swearing-in of the acting governor.He argued no oath of assumption can be administered with the intention of filling the vacancy of governor until 10 days have lapsed from the date of the office falling vacant.He said a notice also must be given, setting in motion the process of filling the office.“The petitioner challenges the process under which he was removed, setting out infringement of his fundamental rights and freedoms and violations of various provisions of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 and other statutes,” the court papers read.He said there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the process did not meet the legal threshold, claiming it was not transparent, accountable and verifiable and its integrity is in question.“It is also well settled that some of the MCAs were in Kilifi county outside the jurisdiction of the Nairobi city county and it is not envisaged that they could vote either physically or virtually, contrary to the provisions of the Standing Orders,” the documents read.Sonko says some MCAs who were outside Nairobi have alleged that their accounts were hacked and corrupted.He also claims that strangers purported to log in and vote on behalf of the MCAs who were in Kilifi.According to the court papers, neither the law nor the Standing Orders provide for virtual voting or attendance of sessions of the Nairobi city county assembly.“It is clear from the screenshots of the Zoom system used on the material date that some members logged into the system more than once with different accounts at the same time. There was double and in some cases quadruple logging into peoples’ accounts, which raises serious questions about the integrity of the process,” Sonko says.Sonko says the proceedings at the Nairobi city county assembly could not have been free and fair because there were a lot of threats, blackmail and intimidation. These could not allow free objective debate and that is why nothing is attached because no debate took place.“Nairobi City  County assembly has 122 MCAs but from the record 146 persons voted. In view of the foregoing, it follows that 24 strangers illegally participated in the process bringing the integrity of the process into question,” he says.(Edited by V. Graham)"
655,One more Covid death amid warning of possible surge,"The number of Kenyans who have succumbed to Covid-19 has risen to 1,686 after one more patient died on Monday.In a statement, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said 106 more people had tested positive for the virus from a sample size of 3,315, representing a positivity rate of 3.19 per cent.The caseload now stands at 96,908 from cumulative tests of 1,059,006 conducted so far.The CS, however, warned the numbers might surge in January before dropping again, largely attributed to the fact that Kenyans are coming out of the festive season.Most people threw caution to the wind, with containment measures not being adhered to.Many urban dwellers travelled upcountry, a move likely to fuel a surge in numbers in rural areas.""The reality is we can expect a bit of a surge in January, but hope it slows,"" Kagwe said.On Sunday, the President extended some of the containment measures, including the curfew hours, for another two months.In his Executive Order, Uhuru said whereas the national positivity rate continues to decline, the Covid-19 pandemic remains a threat to the health and livelihoods of Kenyans.“We must anticipate any situation and therefore that is why we have asked that the preparations for all sorts of isolation facilities in counties are all put in place in the event of anything like that happening,” Kagwe said.He said 184 patients had recovered, raising the recoveries to 79,257. O these, 131 were in the home-based care programme while 53 were discharged from hospitals.“Currently, there are 617 patients admitted in various health facilities countrywide and 2,964 on home-based isolation and care. Twenty-eight patients are in the intensive care unit, 13 of whom are on ventilator support and 12 on supplemental oxygen while three are on observation,” Kagwe said.The CS said 19 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen in general wards.Nairobi recorded 87 new cases followed by Uasin Gishu with five, Kiambu three, Busia, Kajiado and Mombasa two each, while Machakos, Makueni, Kericho, Meru and Kilifi had one case each.Edited by Henry Makori"

657,"Machakos senatorial by-election date revised to March 18, from March 23","The Independent and Electoral Commission (IEBC) has announced a new date for the Machakos Senate by-elections.The commission's chair Wafula Chebukati said on Monday that the by-election will be held on March 18, 2021.Earlier on, the commission had set the by-election for March 23, but the date has been revised due to the national examinations.Chebukati said that the Ministry of Education has informed the commission that on the week of March 23, the national examinations will start, conflicting with the by-election.""To this end, the commission has revised the timelines of the by-election of the Senate Machakoss to March 18, 2021,"" Chebukati said.The seat fell vacant following the death of Senator Boniface Kabaka.Chebukati said that the political parties are to submit to the commission the names of the persons contesting in its party primaries before the nomination day.According to the notice that had been issued earlier regarding the Machakos by-election, political parties had up to today to submit names of persons contesting in the primaries.Political parties will be required to present candidates for the election by January 18, 2021, having resolved all disputes arising from the primaries.Direct nominations will also close on the same date; with parties required to submit names and symbols they intend to use during the by-election.In his statement, Chebukati said that the date set for the Nairobi governor by-election will remain the same, which is February 18, 2021.Matungu and Kabuchai constituencies by-elections will also remain unchanged, which is March 4, 2021."
658,"Yemeni boy, ravaged by hunger, weighs 7 kg","Paralysed and severely malnourished, seven-year-old Faid Samim lies curled up on a hospital bed in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, having barely survived the journey there.“He was almost gone when he arrived but thank God we were able to do what was necessary and he started improving. He is suffering from CP (cerebral palsy) and severe malnutrition,” said Rageh Mohammed, the supervising doctor of the Al-Sabeen hospital’s malnutrition ward.Faid weighs only 7 kg (just over 15 lb) and his tiny, fragile frame takes up barely a quarter of a folded hospital blanket.His family had to travel from Al-Jawf, 170 km (105 miles) north of Sanaa, through checkpoints and damaged roads, to get him there.Unable to afford Faid’s medication or treatment, the family relies on donations to get him treated.Mohammed says malnutrition cases are on the rise and impoverished parents are forced to rely on the kindness of strangers or international aid to get their children treated.Famine has never been officially declared in Yemen, where a six-year war has left 80 per cent of the population reliant on aid in what the U.N. says is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.UN warnings in late 2018 of impending famine prompted an aid ramp-up. But coronavirus restrictions, reduced remittances, locusts, floods, and significant underfunding of the 2020 aid response are exacerbating hunger.The war in Yemen, in which a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement since 2015, has killed more than 100,000 people and left the country divided, with the Houthis holding Sanaa and most major urban centres."
659,Sonko wins round one as court suspends Nairobi by-election,"The former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Monday got temporary reprieve in his quest to overturn his ouster after the court barred IEBC from conducting the by-elections.Justice Antony Mrima temporarily suspended the special gazette notice issued by IEBC last month calling for a by-election in Nairobi after Sonko’s impeachment.The judge ruled that the by-election is temporarily suspended pending the hearing and determination of the application by Sonko.“The special Gazette Notice No. 10914 dated December 21 2020issued by the IEBC be and is hereby suspended until the hearing and determination of the amended Notice of Motion” the order reads.The case will be mentioned on January 14, 2021, for hearing of the application by Sonko.In the case, Sonko moved to court challenging his ouster from office claiming that due process was not followed when he was removed from officeSonko argued that he will suffer irreparable damage not compensatable in monetary terms because he stands to lose his position as the second governor of Nairobi City County without the due process of the law.Through lawyer Wilfred Nyamu, Sonko wants the court to bar the IEBC from holding elections.Sonko faulted the swearing-in of the acting governor, arguing that no oath of assumption can be administered with the intention of filling the vacancy of governor until 10 days have elapsed from the date of the office falling vacant, and a notice has been given setting in motion the process of filling the office.“The petitioner challenges the process under which he was removed setting out infringement of his fundamental rights and freedoms and violations of various provisions of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 and other statutes,” read court papers.He says there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the process did not meet the legal threshold, claiming that it was not transparent, accountable, and verifiable and its integrity is in question.“It is also well settled that some of the MCAs were in Kilifi county outside the jurisdiction of the Nairobi city county and it is not envisaged that they could vote either physically or virtually contrary to the provisions of the Standing Orders,”Sonko says some MCAs who were outside Nairobi have alleged that their accounts were hacked and corrupted.He also claims that strangers purported to log in and vote on behalf of the MCAs who were in Kilifi.According to the court papers, neither the law nor the Standing Orders provide for virtual voting or attendance of sessions of the Nairobi city county assembly.“It is clear from the screenshots of the Zoom system used on the material date that some members logged into the system more than once with different accounts at the same time. There was double and in some cases quadruple logging into peoples’ accounts, which raises serious questions about the integrity of the process,” he says.Senators upheld Sonko's impeachment on December 17. This is after MCAs impeached him on December 3.Some 27 legislators voted in favour of each of the charges thus surpassing the Constitutional threshold of 24 votes needed to remove the governor from office.Sixteen senators voted to oppose each of the charges with two lawmakers – Mutula Kilonzo Jr (Makueni) and Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi) - opting to abstain from the vote.The embattled governor was accused of gross violation of the constitution or any other law, abuse of office, gross misconduct, and crimes under national law."
660,Kenya likely to wait until March for Covid-19 vaccine as India bans export,"The delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine to Kenya could be delayed after the Indian government banned exports for “several months” until it vaccinates its vulnerable people.Kenya expected to receive the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine next month from the contracted manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India (SII).However, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla on Sunday said his company has been barred from exporting any shots until it supplies the Indian government with an initial 100 million doses.“We can only give (the vaccines) to the government of India at the moment,” Poonawalla said in an interview, saying he supports the decision.The Star has contacted Gavi to understand how India’s decision affects supplies for the Covax Facility, the Gavi-administered plan to supply the vaccine to developing countries.Kenya on December 7 last year applied for 24 million doses through Covax, and had expected to receive the initial 12 million doses at the end of this month or early February.“We have ordered vaccines. We are hoping that the vaccines will be here by the end of January or up to the second week of February,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said on Friday.But Poonawalla said the export of vaccines for Covax might not begin until March or April, because of the order by the Indian government.The AstraZeneca vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation by the Indian government on Sunday, but on the condition that SII does not export any shots until the country’s vulnerable populations are protected first, Poonawalla told the AP.Gavi and its partners last year contracted SII to manufacture shots for the Covax facility and even paid funding guarantee.SII is the world’s biggest vaccines manufacturer by volume.Gavi says it has arrangements in place to access nearly two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine candidates, on behalf of 190 participating economies, including Kenya.The arrangements will enable all participating economies to have access to doses by June, with first deliveries anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021 – contingent upon regulatory approvals and countries’ readiness for delivery.Covax  has an agreement with the SII for 200 million doses – with options for up to 900 million doses more – of either the AstraZeneca/Oxford or Novavax candidates, as well as a statement of intent for 200 million doses of the Sanofi/GSK vaccine candidate.On December 18, it announced the signing of an advance purchase agreement with AstraZeneca for a further 170 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate, and an MoU with Johnson & Johnson for 500 million doses of the Janssen candidate, which is currently being investigated as a single dose vaccine.“Securing access to doses of a new vaccine for both higher-income and lower-income countries, at roughly the same time and during a pandemic, is a feat the world has never achieved before – let alone at such unprecedented speed and scale,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, in a statement."
661,"BBI will resolve historical injustices, says Raila","ODM chief Raila Odinga has said Kenyans will have to deal with the same problems bedevilling them should they go to the ballot in 2022 with the Constitution as it is.Raila, who met Muslim faithful led by Sheikh Juma Ngao at Wild Waters Complex, said on Sunday should the BBI fail to pass, many of the issues that Coast residents have been crying about will remain unaddressed.“If we don’t pass this BBI, many of these problems will remain the same. If we go to the elections with the Constitution as it is, there will be no difference,” he warned.Sheikh Ngao, the Kenya Muslim National Advisory Council chair, said the BBI has the same ideals that Islam teaches and will bring peace and understating to the country.“Peace is the most fundamental issue in this BBI. Islam is peace,” he said.The cleric has been a staunch proponent of the BBI in the Coast region, wooing about five million Muslims in the region to support the initiative.Raila said ethnicity, which the BBI is fighting, is a disease of the elite, who are always competing for resources.The ODM chief said historical injustices that the Coast leaders have been complaining about are issues that are addressed in the BBI through the ‘Legal Action’ pillar of the document.The BBI, he said, has not been understood by many people, and it is not only about amending the Constitution.It has three pillars – Administrative, Legal and Social.The Administrative Action pillar involves those things that the government ought to have implemented but has not including the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, the Ndung’u and the Kriegler reports, which he said will be implemented within a specified period once the BBI passes.Raila said the Legal and Administrative Actions pillar involves aligning laws that were developed in the colonial era to the current state.He said it is through this pillar that historical injustices will be addressed.“Already, bills have been drawn, and they only need to be taken to Parliament for debate and passing. That is in the BBI,” Raila said.He said the third pillar, and the most important, is the amendment of parts of the Constitution to suit the current demands of justice and social living.Raila said devolution has been enhanced in the BBI and counties will receive more funds.Currently, counties receive 15 per cent of the revenue collected in the last financial year, but the BBI proposes 35 per cent.He defended governors, saying many times they are blamed for different issues, including lack of desired development at the county level but in truth, it is not their fault.“The money that comes to the counties is so little, most of it is used for recurrent expenditure, mostly paying salaries. The money left for development is so little, nothing much can be done,” he said.The BBI, he said, gives women a chance to have their voices heard.He once again hit out at Deputy President William Ruto, who has blamed him for stalled Jubilee projects.Ruto said they were doing well implementing projects their administration had started before Raila came into the picture through the handshake.However, Raila said Ruto is crying wolf.“Now those who did crime are now shifting blame saying Raila is the crime doer,” he said.Raila said together with Uhuru, he has only been trying to implement the projects that they agreed on through the handshake.“But his deputy of eight years now says he is not responsible for BBI, yet he is drawing salary from and getting protected by the government, the same one he is now condemning. Hypocrisy!” Raila said.He likened Ruto to a spouse, who after a child has been born claims the child is not theirs, yet they are the only two people in the house.“Whose government is this? Isn’t it for Uhuru and Ruto? How come he says this baby is Raila’s?” the ODM party leader posed."
662,Kang'ata to Uhuru: BBI is unpopular in Mt Kenya,"The BBI referendum might fail in Mt Kenya unless President Uhuru Kenyatta and his handshake partner Raila Odinga change their strategy.Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata has issued an early warning to Kenyatta that he risks being left with egg on his face.In a bold letter to the President obtained by the Star, the lawmaker says he has come to the conclusion that BBI is unpopular in Mt Kenya.He cited opposition to the expanded Executive, the involvement of provincial administration and campaigns by former MPs as some of the issues working against the initiative.The Senator said the role of chiefs and county administrators - and other forms of hard tactics - in BBI mobilisation is a challenge in the region.“Let us emphasize on the soft power and art of persuasion. In my humble view, the provincial administration in BBI process should be invisible,” he tells Kenyatta.Kang’ata, who took over from Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika as Senate Majority Chief Whip, said the involvement of national government officers could pass as “use of state’s hard power to force its citizens to endorse BBI.”The Senate Majority Whip said the BBI risks suffering ""spectacular defeat"" if the President does not take immediate steps for a charm offensive.He wants Kenyatta to take charge of marketing BBI in Mt Kenya region, saying the current campaign is uncoordinated.Kanga’ta wants Kenyatta to take advantage of the recently enacted Tea Bill and the efforts to resuscitate coffee farming to position the BBI.The lawmaker cautioned that “the political consequences of a No vote in the region cannot be overemphasized.”“I pray we make urgent remedial efforts to avoid such an outcome,” the Senator says in the six-page letter.He further argues that Jubilee’s performance in the Nairobi governor race will also greatly impact the BBI.“A possible loss by our party’s candidate will have not-so-good political consequences that will permeate into BBI and possibly torpedo it,” he said.He wants the President to personally intervene, as a matter of urgency, and bend backwards as the Jubilee implosion has had an effect on BBI.“Efforts need to be made to rally regionally all MPs irrespective of their political factions behind this cause.”Kang’ata has recommended the use of multiple-choice referendum to insure against possible total rejection of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment), Bill 2020.However, he rejects the proposal by Deputy President William Ruto and his lieutenants that the referendum be held alongside the 2022 polls.The former Kiharu MP argues that the parallel vote would delay the reforms – most of which are tied to the next General Election.Kang’ata notes that Kieleweke MPs who have stood with the President through thick and thin have been sidelined in the process.For instance, he says Kangema MP Muturi Kigano - the chairman of the National Assembly’s JLAC - has been edged out of the BBI programmes in favour of his opponent.He said the grievance is “silently brewing among MPs in the National Assembly with a number of them being ‘komerera' (political double agents) who are bidding their time before they bolt out”.“In the Senate, by virtue of age, personal resources and political experience of most elected Senators, this is not a major issue. I have personally made efforts to intervene on their behalf to relevant authorities to no avail,” he wrote.President Kenyatta is banking on the BBI process to seal his legacy of unity, a process which depends on a referendum by universal suffrage.In his New Year's speech, he made a case for the BBI saying it will cure the winner-takes-all politics, cited as the cause of election chaos in the country.“The proposed first amendment to our Constitution in 2021, I believe, is a bold path that seeks to lay the foundation for a more just, more inclusive, more equitable and more prosperous Kenya.”“It also seeks to make right our politics by eliminating “Winner Takes All” and replacing it with “We All Win”,” President Kenyatta said.But the BBI wave appears to be tossed in the wind in the face of the onslaught by DP Ruto’s side to discredit the document.The lot says it is insensitive for the handshake duo to push for the vote amidst the woes of the Covid-19 pandemic.They want prioritised revival of the economy and addressing job losses occasioned by coronavirus.Ruto and his troops want the referendum held alongside the 2022 General Election.Kandara MP Alice Wahome, a strong ally of the DP, recently accused the President of seeking to use BBI to extend his stay in power.There have been grumbles over 'unfair distribution of new constituencies in the region.Kang’ata says that these arguments are apparently gaining root in the President’s backyard.He adds that there is a general feeling of economic deprivation at household levels in the region, a situation he says the anti-BBI forces have capitalized on.“They (anti-BBI forces) are selling the narrative using the ‘common man’ language. In comparison, the government’s narrative in the region including BBI is being sold by civil servants with limited political skills.”“This is having a negative knock-on effect on BBI. It appears household incomes have either stagnated or plummeted. Many have blamed the stagnating of tea, coffee and milk prices on the government and thus argue BBI is less of their concern,” he writes.Kang’ata adds that the internal problems in the Jubilee Party may have been weaponised and are being used to deflect people’s views on the benefits of BBI.A case in point, he says, is the narrative on the expanded government, say Parliament, to meet the two-thirds gender requirement.“The drafters should have been more imaginative in trying to weigh the goals of a trimmed government and accommodating women.“On a personal level, I understand what led to this proposal. It was the need to accommodate women's lobby concerns, which had judicial endorsement.”Kang’ata wants created a parallel BBI supporting structure to be headed by a quasi-politician to manage MPs.“Maybe a well-resourced office of the secretary general can suffice. This office should be doing the selling of government agenda in the region including BBI.”Edited by Henry Makori"
663,"ODM bigwigs tell Ruto and allies to respect Uhuru, Raila","ODM leaders have cautioned Deputy President William Ruto and his allies against making disparaging remarks against President Uhuru Kenyatta and former PM Raila Odinga.Deputy party leader Hassan Joho and Nairobi branch chairman George Aladwa warned against unwarranted attacks at a time when the head of state and the opposition chief are uniting the country.Joho dared the DP and his allies to cut links with their parties to gauge their popularity. He demanded respect for the handshake duo, challenging the Tangatanga members to decamp and seek a fresh mandate at the ballot if they have lost confidence in the leadership of their sponsoring parties.""It is quite embarrassing and disheartening to see the DP preside over public events where his troops are issuing disparaging statements targeting the President and our party leader Raila Amollo Odinga,"" Aladwa said.""The DP should also stop calling out party leaders using unprintable words in the name of seeking political mileage.""Joho further termed it hypocritical for elected leaders to attack their sponsoring parties while continuing to earn salaries as a result of the same outfits.“These people want to say their parties have failed the people but still continue earning salaries and allowances on the basis of a mandate given to them by voters loyal to the same parties,” he said in a statement.""They cannot and will not quit and seek fresh mandate because they are not sure they will win and they are not sure they are ready to be out of power.”His comments come at a time when Tangatanga legislators from Coast have criticised ODM and Jubilee following the Msambweni by-election won by a pro-Ruto independent candidate.Feisal Bader garnered 15,251 votes to trounce ODM's Omar Boga who secured 10,444 votes in the hotly contested poll.The Coast rebels, carried away by the Msambweni victory, have also announced plans to form a regional party to completely lock out ODM from the region.The legislators said the victory marked the beginning of the end of ODM and have now embarked on the formation of an outfit to 'wipe out' the Orange party.“With the results that we posted in Msambweni on December 15, we believe it is the beginning of the end of ODM,” Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani of Jubilee said last month.But in a statement, Joho insisted there is nothing new behind the planned formation of a regional political outfit, dismissing it as a survival tactic by leaders known for conmanship and fraud.“Formation of a new political party will only serve to divide the people further and undermine the unity that the region has enjoyed in ODM and which has enabled us to push our agenda as a united region on the national stage,” the second-term county chief said.Meanwhile, Aladwa urged Uhuru and Raila to give directions on the Nairobi gubernatorial by-election. He expressed confidence that the candidate backed by the two leaders will carry the day. The poll has been scheduled for next month.The Makadara lawmaker told ODM supporters to remain calm as they wait for the final direction from the handshake duo. There has been confusion on whether the party will field a candidate or sponsor joint candidates for governor and deputy governor with Jubilee.This follows conflicting information that it had withdrawn from the race, despite the party's National Elections Board clearing Orange Women League president Beth Syengo and former Homa Bay gubernatorial aspirant Sam Wakiaga to vie. Aladwa said a communication from the two leaders will settle the matter.“As ODM Nairobi branch chairman, I want to make it clear that ODM is waiting for a joint resolve and communiqué from President Kenyatta and our party leader Raila Odinga on the way forward regarding this poll,” Aladwa said in a statement.“I understand that Nairobians, more so ODM supporters, want a clear direction on how they should approach the election. I, therefore, call upon our esteemed supporters to wait for the official communication from our party leaders."
664,No fatality as Kenya maintains positivity rate below 5%,"Kenya’s Covid-19 positivity rate has remained below five per cent for the past seven days, an indicator that the country might be flattening the curve.Yesterday, the Health Ministry confirmed that 124 more people had tested positive for the virus from a sample size of 2,855 tested within 24 hours, representing a positivity rate of 4.3 per cent.No fatality was recorded, meaning the death toll remains 1,685.The number of patients in health facilities and in critical care, as well as those under the home-based care programme, has been on the decline.Yesterday, 650 patients were in health facilities across the country and 2,934 were being taken care of at home. Data from the ministry showed that 26 patients were in intensive care units, 12 of whom were on ventilator support, 11 on supplemental oxygen and three under observation.Another 19 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen in the general wards, with none being in the high dependency unit.The World Health Organisation recommends that for a country to be seen as having flattened the curve, it must record a positivity rate of below five per cent for at least 14 consecutive days.“At the moment the country is experiencing very low rates, below five per cent over the past almost seven days or so and for that reason, there is the confidence that hopefully, it is something we can maintain even after opening the schools,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said.“However, we must anticipate any situation and that is why we have asked that the preparations for all sorts of isolation facilities in the counties are all put in place just in the event of anything like that happening.”The ministry also confirmed that 216 patients had recovered from the disease, 178 from the home-based care programme and 38 from health facilities, raising the recoveries to 79,073.“As a ministry, we will continue to pursue other means of protection and as you are aware, we are also working on vaccines,” Kagwe said.He said teachers are also frontline soldiers because they interact with many learners.In terms of distribution per county, Nairobi recorded 67 cases, followed by Busia with 12, Lamu eight, Nakuru six, while Mombasa and Nakuru had five each.Machakoshad four new cases; Isiolo, Makueni and Uasin Gishu three cases each; Meru and Taita Taveta two each; while Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Kisumu and Narok had one case each."
665,Fimbo ya Nyayo: Will Gideon Moi restore Kanu to its former glory?,"Baringo Senator Gideon Moi is facing a back-breaking task in his bid to rejuvenate Kanu — the country’s oldest political party, which his father, the late President Daniel Moi, steered for more than two decades.Gideon, Moi’s lastborn son and Kanu chairman, was handed his father's rungu, popularly known as Fimbo ya Nyayo, to succeed the late President as the party’s supremo and revitalise the outfit.The rungu was synonymous with Moi's reign, which came to an end in 2002, the same year Kanu’s presidential candidate Uhuru Kenyatta, now President, lost to a united opposition under Narc, throwing the party into political oblivion for the first time since Independence.During Mzee Moi’s burial at his Kabarak home, Nakuru county, in February last year, his eldest son Raymond (Jonathan having died), gave the ‘political baton’ to his younger brother Gideon, making the senator his father's heir insofar as national politics is concerned.  “Jogoo mwenyeye amelala. Na kama amelala, ninapea huyu ile rungu... na yeye akiregarega… si mimi niko hapa... Kwani mimi ni statue? (The cock is gone. So I now give Gideon this baton. If he doesn't put it to good use, I will be here to take it back),” said Raymond, who is the Rongai MP.Fimbo ya Nyayo was a symbol of power, leadership and national cohesion. The late President carried it on his right-hand wherever he was for the 24 years he was in power. But the handover came at a time the fortunes of the outfit had already dwindled in the face of cutthroat competition in the political arena.Gideon, while receiving the baton, acknowledged the daunting task of turning around the party’s competitiveness ahead of the 2022 General Election.“I was not expecting this... hata kushika hii rungu... nitashika and I will do my best… so help me God,” Gideon said.Will he succeed? Political pundits say he has a mountain to climb. He already faces a battle royal in his Rift Valley backyard against his political nemesis DP William Ruto. It won't be easy to topple the DP.On Saturday, Gideon encountered rowdy youths who blocked his team as he went for a dawn meeting with Talai clan elders in Nandi. Talai elders last year met Ruto and blessed him as the Kalenjin spokesman and leader.Hundreds of youth blocked roads, leading to Kapsisiywa where Gideon had been invited by a section of the elders for blessings amid intensifying rivalry between him and the DP over control of the Kalenjin community ahead of the 2022 polls.The goings-on aside, political observers say Gideon’s ‘cold’ stature, stiff political competition from Ruto in his Rift Valley backyard and Kanu’s burden of historical ills are the key factors barricading the party’s rejuvenation.Kanu, which ruled the country for 39 years from 1963 to 2002, has had a really dark side. Its longest-serving leader, Moi, was accused of oppression, with dissidents subjected to detention without trial.“To be able to restore Kanu to its former glory, Gideon Moi should be able to marshal support from his backyard, that is Rift Valley because that's where his party enjoys the greatest support,” analyst Eric Mutuma said.In the absence of absolute control of the Rift Valley, which would require him to box Ruto out of the region politically, Mutuma reckoned that it will be a tall order for Gideon to revamp the party.“From all indications, right now, Gideon Moi is not the kingpin of Rift Valley. He does not speak for the Rift Valley. I doubt whether he controls any section of the region. It is an uphill task for him to try to outdo Ruto and revitalise the party,” he reiterated.Analyst Mark Bichachi echoed the sentiments, saying Gideon must devise a working strategy to market the party that is fast losing taste among most Kenyans.“If Gideon wants to revive Kanu as a personality cult as many parties are, he needs to do a lot. He has to take on Ruto — something he either seems unwilling to do or is slow to do.“In that regard, he would be in big trouble if he does not have a tribal base from which to launch his personality cult. But if he wants to develop a party, then he has a bigger opportunity. He can use Kanu’s history and resources to build another vibrant party, recruit young people and rebrand the outfit,” Bichachi said.The stiff opposition from Ruto, undisputedly the political kingpin in Kalenjinland, could be Gideon's Achilles heel. The DP has neutralised senior Moi’s influence in the region, with leaders and the electorate following him almost to a man.However, Kanu’s stalwarts disagree. Secretary-general Nick Salat and Tiaty MP William Kamket say since officially assuming the mantle, Gideon has endeavoured to put the party on the path towards transformation and popularisation.They said the party leader has embarked on aggressive activities that will culminate in rebranding and changing of the party slogan to make it ‘great again’ and shed off the emotional baggage associated with it.The chairman has been meeting with party delegates across the country, repainting and rebranding party offices and opening new ones, recruiting members, filling vacant positions, and marketing the party in readiness for the 2022 polls.“We have come full circle. We are retracing our routes. We are changing the name to Kanu-Fresh,” Kamket told the Star.Salat said the party is deeply involved in BBI activities while maintaining its identity as part of a wider rejuvenation plan ahead of the 2022 political duel.“We want to get out there in the outfit of Kanu. We don’t want to lose our identity in all this,” he said.He said a top Kanu organ has endorsed the change of the party slogan from Jogoo to Kanu Sasa or Kanu Fresh, with the same expected to be subjected to a vote by party delegates.“If we say, the majority of people in this country are youth, those people were born probably when Kanu was already out of power. It is how we present our party before the electorate that matters,” he said.Javas Bigambo, a political commentator, said Gideon may revamp the party but only if he leads the outfit through a different and strong ideological path for repositioning and seeking public forgiveness for the ills that the party committed throughout the period of its political glory.“He may also need to get firebrand party officials from other tribes and regions. Without that, the party will continue limping because of the burden of the history,” he said. Edited by F'Orieny"
666,Three days till nurses strike referral hospitals,"It's just a three-day sigh of relief for patients.Nurses agreed on Sunday not to go on strike at Kenyatta National Hospital and the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital - for three more days. That's not much time to end their 29-day-long strike. Those hospitals had been exempted.The union will hold more talks with Labour CS Simon Chelungui on Monday to end the stalemate.The nurses’ union had last week threatened to strike at the two national referral hospital's on Monday if their grievances are not resolved.Nurses in the two referral hospitals had been exempted from the strike by their union because most of their issues had been addressed by the hospitals.Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako said on Sunday the union had decided to give the government three more days to reach an agreement.If they fail to find a durable solution in three days, the strike is definitely on at KNH and MTRH, he said.“We have looked at the steps so far taken and we give them an extension of three days,” Panyako said.He added,  Because the impact of the industrial action is being felt, the reason for going on strike is to have your issues resolved. So if the impact is felt there is no need for us to bring in more institutions because of the suffering of Kenyans. At least we have two facilities we know are still operational.”The healthcare workers have been on strike demanding quality PPEs, comprehensive medical cover, risk allowance, hiring of more healthcare workers and dedicated health facilities per county for those who contract Covid-19 while on duty. They also want a national Health Services Commission.The nurses and have been on strike for 29 days. More than six meetings failed to resolve their issues.As at Sunday, 34 nurses had succumbed to Covid-19 in the line of duty; many more fell ill.“We will be drafting our minimal demands and giving them to the Ministry of Labour. If they will be in agreement with us, then we are prepared to sign immediately,"" Panyako said.The nurses are the only healthcare cadre still on strike after the clinical officers signed their return to work agreement with the Health CS on Friday. Doctors too returned to work.During a press briefing at Afya House on Friday, Kenya Union of Clinical Officers national chairman Peterson Wachira said the parties had reached a consensus.""This is not an end in itself... but it's a journey we are taking to ensure the attainment of universal coverage,"" Wachira said.Clinical officers are to be given adequate PPEs, medical cover and group life insurance. Their CBA is to be registered in court soon.Similarly, it was agreed that employment terms for those under contract for fewer than six months will be reviewed.The doctors called off their strike on December 24, after signing a return-to-work agreement with the Health Ministry, the Council of Governors and the Labour ministry, among others.(Edited by V.

669,"Locust spraying fails in Kitui, residents yell, beat pans","Kitui South residents are desperately trying to scare off swarms of locusts after heavy rains and wind made aerial spraying impossible. They are keeping round-the-clock vigils on their fairs. They are yelling, whistling, banging pots and pans and lighting bonfires.Rains started on Thursday when a military fixed-wing aircraft arrived and water would have diluted the insecticide. Spraying attempts were to resume on Sunday.The rain arrived at the same time as the military aircraft so the operation was called off.“The aircraft only sprayed one place in Kanziku ward three times for 30 minutes but it had to stop because of rain. Some locusts were killed,"" Kanziku MCA James Munuve said.He said the swarm that invaded his ward has split into two, with one infesting neighbouring Ikutha ward. One swarm remains in Mutha ward.“The swarms are wreaking havoc on crops as aerial spraying is impossible in the rain,"" he saidThe MP said locusts were concentrated in Mwangala and Muthue in Kanziku ward; Ngomano and Mavia, Imiw’a and Ngomano in Ikutha ward and at Kivandini and Ilamba in Mutha ward.Politician Micheal Kivoto said the insects had caused major crop damage in his  Muthue village.He said the government must use stronger measures or all the crops will be devoured.""There must be accelerated efforts to eradicate the insects,"" Kivoto said.Kitui Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau said the rains had halted aerial spraying for three days.

670,"Government rehabilitates idle, dilapidated railway line","For many years, the meter railway line connecting various parts of the country has been lying idle, dilapidated and overgrown with bushes.The government, however, started reviving the line after the much-touted standard gauge railway line failed to reach its destination.The SGR was supposed to extend to Kisumu and later Ugandan border.However, lack of funds made it impossible to extend it.This means that the meter gauge railway will connect to SGR in Naivasha and go all the way to Malaba border.The cost of construction of the SGR line from Mombasa port to Nairobi was Sh320 billion while the cost of the line from Nairobi to Naivasha dry Port was Sh 150 billion.Already, a Chinese firm has started rehabilitating the 23.5km meter gauge rail connecting the SGR line.China Road and Bridge Corporation is building the new short track and rehabilitating a decades-old line from Malaba on the border with Uganda to Longonot in Naivasha.The Nanyuki line was built by the colonial government in the 1920s. Magadi line was built in 1915.In 1913, a line opened from Nairobi to Thika. It was later extended to Murang’a, Nyeri and arrived in Nanyuki in 1930.Other lines were built to Solai (1926), Kitale (1926), Eldoret-Uganda (1928), Nyahururu (1929) and Kisumu-Butere (1932).Some of the lines have however been neglected.Last year, however, the government embarked on rehabilitating some of the lines.Already, some of the land belonging to Kenya Railways had been encroached on.On August 12, the newly refurbished Sh1.8 billion Nairobi-Nanyuki railway was launched with expectations that the line will provide cheaper and safer transportation of fuel to the Central Region Economic Bloc.The line cuts through Nairobi-Thika-Maragua- Sagana-Karatina-Nanyuki.The region is rich in tea, coffee and dairy farming.Already, Vivo Energy has constructed a fuel depot in Nanyuki with a storage capacity of 11.5 million litres on 11 acres. The company has started using the line to transport fuel.Vivo Energy is the marketer of Shell Oil products. Managing director Peter Murungi said the rehabilitation of the line is a big step as they strive to ensure that Mount Kenya region and neighbouring counties all the way to the Northern Frontier have sufficient fuel supply.He said the overall oil demand for the region is 4,403,705 tonnes.Kenya Railways MD Philip Mainga said two trains have been moving petroleum products for Vivo.""We are happy the line is in good condition,"" he said. ""The line will transform the economy of this region as it has a lot of potential,"" Mainga added.Kenya Railways expected to generate more than Sh370.4 million per year from the revived 240km line.Petroleum products being the key cargo for the line, Kenya Railways will be charging about Sh82,000 for 50 tonnes of fuel tank, with a tonne costing Sh1,640.Kenya Railways is also rehabilitating the 216 kilometers Nakuru-Kisumu line at a cost of about Sh 2.8 billion.Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi said the refurbishment of the old metre gauge railway will open a new chapter in the region’s economy.“This is what we need. The counties in Central Region Economic Bloc where the line is passing have an economic value of Sh2.7 trillion,” Muriithi said in Nanyuki.Kenya Railways has also been rehabilitating meter gauge lines and stations within Nairobi.The rehabilitation is meant to have commuters enjoy improved services by increasing the capacity of commuter trains.The parastatal recently imported secondhand Diesel Multiple Units with a life span of 25 years to move Nairobi railway passengers from about 300,000 a month to three million.Nairobi has a population of about four million people, 70 per cent of whom are dependent on public transport.Deloitte City Mobility Index says Nairobi lacks integrated public transport, leading to high congestion levels despite only 13 per cent of trips being made by cars.The index reviews major cities on key aspects of mobility and the resulting relationship to economic performance.Mainga said the corporation has so far rehabilitated five stations in Nairobi, four in Kiambu and one in Machakos.The stations are Mwiki, Dandora, Donholm, Pipeline, Embakasi Village, Ruiru, Kahawa, Githurai, Kikuyu and Athi River.Edited by Henry Makori"
671,ODM’s era in the coastal region has been catastrophic: Ruto allies claim,"A section of political leaders drawn from the Coastal Region allied to Deputy President William Ruto have blasted Mombasa Governor for his comments regarding Ruto.In a joint statement on Sunday, the hustler nation said that the region has been ‘the most disastrous and catastrophic’ for more than a decade under ODM.“ODM sunk a region struggling to emerge from the yoke of marginalisation into the abyss of mediocrity, bad governance and poor leadership largely witnessed by the election of the types of Hassan Joho,” part of the statement read.They have criticised governor Hassan Joho’s leadership style, saying that his dominance in the region is coming to an end following the concluded Msambweni by-elections.“… the rise of the hustler power in the Coast Region signaled and evidenced by the hustler’s victory in the just-concluded Msambweni by-elections and the winds of change sweeping across the region and indeed Kenya.”Earlier on Sunday, Joho slammed the plans orchestrated by Ruto allies to form a political party that will unite the coastal area.Joho had said that the move is meant to cause division in the region, which he claimed has been solid for years under ODM.The governor had also blamed the DP for being the sponsor of the push to form a political party to counteract ODM.But the DP allies in the statement said that since the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga, Joho tried with no success to invite or frame a contest between himself the DP.They have vowed to continue pushing for a change of political dominance in the region, adding that the Msambweni conquest was just the beginning.“Never again shall we allow the ODM charade of hallucination to Canaan and the vitendawilis that are the only policies we remember of its leader, reign over the soul of our politics and our future.”Also, the group has defended Ruto’s frequent tour to the region, saying that it has led to a myriad of development programmes launched by him during Jubilee’s first term in office.The hustler nation has claimed that the Jubilee’s second term in office has been more of a handshake, which has scuttled the development agenda at the altar of the BBI.“What Joho is seeing is coming to fruition of projects largely launched during Jubilee’s first term by the Deputy President William Ruto. A genuine class experience would have assisted Joho to appreciate such simple and naked facts.”They added that the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) is not a solution to the region’s or Kenya’s ensuing challenges.The team has also claimed that Joho ""in cahoots presided over the destruction and demise of the Coast economy through the shift of Port and Maritime logistics to Nairobi and Naivasha.""The joint statement was signed by Mohamed Ali (Nyali), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), Benjamin Tayari (Kinango), Owen Baya (Kilifi North), Paul Katana (Kaloleni), Ali Wario (Bura), Shariff Athman ( Lamu East), and Feisal Bader (Msambweni).Others are Haika Mizighi (Women Rep, Taita Taveta), Rehema Hassan (Women Rep, Tana River), and Hassan Omar, Former Senator, Mombasa."
672,UK Covid rules 'probably going to get tougher' Boris Johnson,"Regional restrictions in England are ""probably about to get tougher"" to curb rising Covid infections, the prime minister has warned.Boris Johnson told the BBC stronger measures may be required in parts of the country in the coming weeks.He said this included the possibility of keeping schools closed, although this is not ""something we want to do"".But he added ministers had to be ""realistic"" about the spread of the new variant of the virus.Johnson said the government was ""entirely reconciled to doing what it takes to get the virus down"" and warned of a ""tough period ahead"".He said increasing vaccination would provide a way out of restrictions and that he hoped ""tens of millions"" would be vaccinated in the next three months.Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show,  Johnson said he stuck by his previous prediction that the situation would be better by the spring.But he added: ""It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in many parts of the country. I'm fully, fully reconciled to that.""""And I bet the people of this country are reconciled to that because, until the vaccine really comes on stream in a massive way, we're fighting this virus with the same set of tools.""He added that ministers had taken ""every reasonable step that we reasonably could"" to prepare for winter, but ""could not have reasonably predicted"" the new, more transmissible variant of the virus that has emerged over the autumn."
673,"Joho slams the push for the formation of the coastal party, says ODM has united them","Mombasa County Governor Hassan Joho has blasted Deputy President William Ruto and his allies on their remarks to have a political party from the coastal region.In a statement on Sunday, Joho, who is also the ODM party Deputy leader said that Ruto has undermined the development in the coastal area.He said that the move to push for a new party to unite the coastal region is not a new thing and is only meant to benefit a few individuals who are close to the DP.“Formation of a new party will only serve to divide the people further r and undermine the unity that the region has enjoyed in ODM and which has enabled them to push our agenda as a united region on the national stage,” Joho said.His remarks come after Coast MPs allied to Ruto disclosed a plan to hasten the formation of a regional party to completely lockout ODM from the region.The legislators said that the recent victory of their candidate in Msambweni marked the begging of the end of ODM and have now embarked on the formation of an outfit to 'wipe out' the Orange party.He said that the move to push for a new party to unite the coastal region is not a new thing and is only meant to benefit a few individuals who are close to the DP.“Formation of a new party will only serve to divide the people further r and undermine the unity that the region has enjoyed in ODM and which has enabled them push our agenda as a united region on the national stage,” Joho said.The governor added that Ruto is behind the push for the party formation, challenging the leaders who are allied to him to declare their stand and surrender their current positions.“Like their sponsor William Ruto, these leaders lack the courage to say have moved and they are ready to surrender their current positions and seek a fresh mandate.”He referred to the people behind the formation of a regional party as ‘fraudsters and conmen’.“We are talking about the people who say Jubilee Party and ODM have failed the people of the coast but the same leaders continue to earn salaries on the basis of votes cast for Jubilee and ODM in 2017.”Joho has purported that the DP and his allies have become the enemy of the progress in the region but, the area has benefited from the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga.“Since Ruto and his team got pushed aside in the ruling party, on-going development projects that have the potential to change the fortunes of the region have continued to flow to the coast from the national government.”He has asked the people behind the intention to form the coastal regional party to be bold enough and quit their parties and seek a fresh mandate.“Kenya and the Coast will not progress through fraud and lies. We need honest and principled leadership.”"

678,Murder most foul: Kinoti fails to crack Kenei's killing,"Despite DCI George Kinoti saying AP sergeant Kipyegon Kenei was killed by powerful individuals, the  killing remains unresolved 11 months later.The discovery of Kenei's body with a single bullet in a servant quarters at Villa France estate in Imara Daima on February 20, not only shocked the nation but also left more questions than answers.The fact that Kenei was attached to Deputy President William Ruto's office and that he had a few days earlier been at the centre of a military guns tender drama brought more attention to his killing. Kenei was not an ordinary police officer. It would later emerge that he was a member of the DP's inner ring of trusted security officers based at the Harambee Annex office.“The death of the officer was not an ordinary murder. It was a high-stakes execution aimed at sending out a strong message,” a senior Director of Criminal Investigation officer said.According to the officer, the probe into Kenei's murder is still active but has encountered many 'roadblocks', which he said threaten to derail the whole investigation.“It will have to take a while before this complex investigation is concluded,” the officer, who sought anonymity, told the Star.He, however, said up to 90 per cent of the ground work has been pieced together.The revelations only add into the agony of Kenei's family, which had hoped that the killers of the 33-year-old sergeant would be brought to book the soonest.None other than DCI chief Kinoti concluded that Kenei was eliminated to conceal evidence into the botched Sh39 billion military arms tender.The policeman had handled ex-Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa and his alleged fake arms dealers at the DP's Harambee House Annex office.  Kinoti moved with gusto to demonstrate to the country that his office had the technical expertise to unravel the mystery of the murder, whose timing was linked to the military guns scam.From heavily deploying officers for a 24-hour vigil at the Kenei's Imara Daima house to the public display of re-corrections of the events that could have transpired before the officer was killed, Kinoti vowed to leave no stone unturned.But almost an year after this display of bravado on nailing Kenei's killers, the case remains part of the statistics in the grisly catalogue of unsolved murders that could haunt the DCI in the New Year.Kenei's murder could have passed as other low-profile execution until DCI swung into action moments after police officers had moved the body from the crime scene after concluding that it was another case of  suicide inn the police service.In fact, Kinoti — who visited the scene as many times as possible to demonstrate his resolve to crack the murder — had to order the officers to return the body to the scene for thorough processing after suspecting foul play.It was at this time that officers from the Homicide department under the command of Martin Nyaguto took over the scene alongside Forensics head Nicholas Kamwende.In one of the most memorable instances, Kinoti's team developed sketches and maps and demonstrated possible scenarios in efforts to piece together the murder scene.Form the demonstrations, Kinoti personally rehashed the scenes at a media briefing on March 5, insisting that Kenei's murder was the work of powerful individuals in the corridors of power.According to Kinoti, the killing was “necessary” to protect the powerful individuals from the consequences of using the country's military procurement process in the most “deceitful and fraudulent manner.”“The involvement of the deceased in the complex activities clearly shows he didn't have a chance. It is evident that throughout, he was receiving instructions or directions from a certain source. It is manifest that the stakes must be so high and adverse that it could be dangerous to expose the source,” Kinoti explained.In a rare move that day, the DCI boss laid bare the circumstances under which Kenei died, concluding that the DP's guard was murdered in connection with the Sh39 billion fake military arms tender allegedly involving Echesa.With the passing of time, the ""powerful people"" Kinoti said eliminated Kenei to protect, safeguard and insulate themsleves in connection with the arms scandal have never been arrested for prosecution.“This is a murder that was most obvious by observations but complex in the nature of its execution and planning,"" security analyst Bonface Khalisa said.According to Khalisa, it would be nearly impossible for Kinoti's team to crack the murder they took to the doorstep of the DP's Harambee Annex office.“Kinoti's displays were just public stunts meant to further cover up the murder and not to resolve it,” Khalisa told the Star.Kinoti had furiously alleged that the murder was orchestrated by people linked to the military arms scandal and who wanted him out of the way following the bungled deal.“Our colleague's murder is 100 per cent linked to the ongoing investigations. It was not suicide as initially perceived but pure murder, well executed and stage-managed,” Kinoti said.Kenei had days before played a central role in ushering in Echesa into the DP's waiting room alongside two foreigners who were allegedly in the country to ink the Sh39 billion arms deal.This incident, which was captured by CCTV, according to Kinoti, made Kenei a key figure in the entire saga as well as a potential witness on what actually transpired at Harambee House Annex.In what lifted the lid on the intrigues surrounding the probe, Ruto launched a vicious attack on Kinoti, claiming he was using Kenei's murder as part of an orchestrated war to undermine and destroy his office.Speaking during Kenei's burial in at his Chemasis village home in Nakuru county, Ruto claimed that the DCI had shifted focus to malign him and his office instead of pursuing the killers.""I know there is a bigger scheme to destroy my office and ensure I do not go anywhere. The schemers are trying to threaten, undermine and demean my office in a bid to stop me. They may have the system but I have God,"" an agitated DP said.According to Ruto, Kenei was possibly killed for political reasons mainly to spark a conflict between him and his community.""Wale wanaopanga hii njama eti wanipiganishe mimi na jamii yangu, shauri yao (those who are behind all these are planning to cause conflict between me and my community),"" Ruto said.The DCI boss had discounted Ruto's initial claim that Echesa was at his Harambee Annex office for a mere 23 minutes in what sparked a war of words with the DP's office.Kinoti had produced CCTV footage showing that the ex-CS and his accomplices spent at least 1:22:59 hours at the second most powerful office in Kenya."
679,Students will not be allowed to handle hand sanitisers :Magoha,"The government will not allow large quantities of hand sanitisers in schools, Education CS George Magoha has said.The CS said that only about five litres of sanitizers will be allowed in school compounds and will only be handled by teachers.The CS who spoke at Kiangochi primary school on Saturday while inspecting its preparedness said hand sanitisers have over 70 per cent alcohol content and might be misused by students.“Our children are very creative and we all know what they may do with it. We will not allow over five litres of sanitisers to go into schools,"" Magoha said.He continued that ""Quantity of sanitisers should only be handled by teachers for the purpose of general school population when in public places"".He also noted that the government has procured over 7 million masks that will be issued to children from disadvantaged students.The masks have been produced by the National Youth Service (NYS) and Rivatex through syndicated efforts between the Ministry of education and Ministry of Health, and partners such as UNICEF and the Kenya Commercial Bank.According to Magoha, face masks will be part of uniforms and no child will be allowed back in school without them. “The government is ready to ensure that any child that genuinely requires masks acquires some because they will be mandatory and will be part of their school uniform,” he added.He pointed out that the masks are ready for disbursement and that the beneficiaries will be put in a database.Magoha however, noted that despite disgruntlement from a section of stakeholders, most parents have procured masks as they prepare their children for the school re-opening.“Some people have been saying that procuring of masks by parents is a big challenge but it was not a problem when the first three classes re-opened three months ago and will not be now.""He advised parents who are unable to buy surgical masks to acquire a pair of three-layered cloth masks for each child.Magoha further noted that private schools will only be allowed to re-open if the number of children in a particular class conforms to the number of children in public schools.Students from private schools that will not be able to re-open due to infrastructural challenges will be absorbed in public schools in accordance with the Ministry’s guidelines.“We will consider their marks.

682,India approves AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine,"India has approved the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, paving the way for a huge immunisation campaign in the world’s second most populous country.Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters on Saturday the vaccine had been given the green light on Friday, confirming what sources close to the matter had told Reuters.It is the first  Covid-19 vaccine to be approved for emergency use by India, which has the highest number of infections after the United States and comes on the day the country is running a nationwide mock drill for vaccine delivery.Javadekar said at least three more vaccines were waiting to be approved - local company Bharat Biotch’s COVAXIN, Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D and Russia’s Sputnik-V.“India is perhaps the only country where at least four vaccines are getting ready,” he said.One was approved yesterday for emergency use, Serum’s COVISHIELD.” he said, referring to the fact that the AstraZeneca/Oxford shot is being made locally by the Serum Institute of India (SII).India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) is expected to announce the dosage and other details about the shot later. SII had applied for a two full-dose regime about 28 days apart.The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, which was granted its first approval by Britain on Tuesday, is cheaper and easier to use than some rival shots - major advantages in tackling a pandemic that has claimed more than 1.8 million lives worldwide.However, it has been plagued with uncertainty about its most effective dosage ever since data published in November showed a half-dose followed by a full dose had a 90 per cent success rate while two full shots were 62 per cent effective."
683,Sleuths probing botched circumcision that left two initiates dead in Rumuruti,"Detectives are pursuing a caregiver in Rumuruti, Laikipia County following a botched circumcision that left two initiates dead.The police said that one of the victims identified as George Kibet was hurriedly buried at an unidentified grave by the caregiver after succumbing to the condition.The caregiver, who has been identified as Sitienei Kibiomet, is said to have closely collaborated with the father of Kibet without the knowledge of other family members.Some of the family members demanded to know the whereabouts of their kin, forcing the caregiver to disappear from his Ndurumo home in Rumuruti, after being informed that the police were about to arrest him.The detectives have already launched a manhunt for him, but Julius Chesang, the father of the deceased has been arrested and is assisting the police with investigations.The two boys were among the 25 young men who underwent the rite of passage on December 15, 2020, administered by a clinical officer, and were handed over to Sitienei.However, as they were recuperating, some of them were infected with a yet to be established infection and have been seeking medication from a medical practitioner.The two of the initiates died while others have been admitted at Unison Medical Centre, in Rumuruti.It is during their investigations that detectives established that prior to Kibet’s death, another initiate had died and was buried within the precincts of the caregiver’s compound.Officers are yet to establish the exact spot where the remains of the second initiate were buried.As investigations continue, the detectives will be seeking exhumation orders for the body of the initiate buried in Sitienei’s compound, for an autopsy to be conducted to ascertain the exact cause of death.Also, the detectives will widen their investigations to establish whether Covid-19 restrictions were adhered to and if relevant government agencies were notified, including whether burial permits were issued.Members of the public have been asked to report to the nearby police station or use the toll-free line 0800 722 203 if they have any information on the whereabouts of the caregiver, Sitienei."
684,Uhuru using BBI to cling to power - MP Wahome,"Kandara MP Alice Wahome has once again hit out at President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying he should accept his time is up and stop ""hiding behind BBI to cling to power"" beyond his term.The lawmaker on Saturday claimed the President is seeking to change the 2010 Constitution to help him gain control of state power while outside through what she termed a façade of democracy.Wahome in a statement said the Building Bridges Initiative is suspect in the grand scheme to keep Uhuru in power directly or indirectly after the expiry of his second constitutional term limit in 2022. She warned Kenyans will regret if the Constitutional amendment being spearheaded by the president and ODM leader Raila Odinga sees the light of the day.“For Kenya, to remain a truly democratic and rule of law state, our President must accept the reality his term is coming to an end. He must ensure peaceful transfer of power in 2022 and go home,” Wahome said.She added: “He should not be allowed to extend his stay in power in whatever form whether direct and or indirect/through proxy.”This is not the first time the lawmaker is accusing the President of plotting to cling to power, exactly one year ago she made similar remarks.Wahome, a strong ally of Deputy President William Ruto, also described Uhuru as the biggest threat to the Constitution democracy , devolution and a President who presided over the crumbling  economy in his five years in power.“It is time President Kenyatta admitted he has made costly economic and fiscal policy mismanagement mistakes in the last seven years. He cannot blame and or pass the buck to anybody. The buck stops constitutionally with President for final decision upon getting prerequisite advice,” she said.“There is no hiding the fact that the economy and financial status of the country is in turmoil. Our country is in an enormous health care crisis. Unemployment rate and the cost of living has hit the roof.”She further accused Uhuru of shrinking the country’s democratic space through micro-managing of the Police Service and frustrating the Judiciary through budget cuts and failing to appoint judges.The lawmaker said they will reject any attempt to change the Constitution through the much publiscised BBI, adding they will instead shift focus into rebuilding the lives of hustlers who have been affected by the  Covid-19 pandemic.“Hustlers have responded to the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). They do not want to hear anything about BBI. BBI is mocking and laughing at Hustlers’ sufferings,” she said."
685,"Kitui man, 35, charged with brutally attacking wife with an axe","A 35-year-old-man from Kyuso in Kitui has pleaded guilty to brutally attacking his wife with an axe and leaving her for dead.The wife, Jane Bahati,28, was admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, in critical condition. She later slipped into a coma and was taken to the ICU. Kyuso police commander Charles Machinji said Makau Musya was put on a holding charge because of the wife's condition. He said the police had to charge Musya after the expiry of the days the court had allowed them to hold him.“The ideal charge against the accused person will be preferred when the fate of the hospitalised victim becomes clear. Depending on how things go, he might even end up being charged with a more serious offence of attempted murder,” Machinji said.Musya was arrested on December 23 when he surrendered to the police at Kyuso, a day after he went into hiding following the attack. The police were granted court orders to hold him for seven days, pending the conclusion of investigations.Musya was charged on Wednesday before Kyuso senior resident magistrate John Aringo. The court heard that on December 22 at Kimu sub-location in Kyuso, he unlawfully caused grievous bodily harm to Bahati. He admitted guilt. The prosecution urged the court to suspend his sentencing for seven days pending the fate of the wife.Aringo granted the prosecution’s prayers, termind them justified. He thus ordered that the accused be remanded until January 7, 2021, when the case will be mentioned. Muasya was held at the Waita GK Prison."
686,"'Burning bridges' tweet a revelation of IEBC mindset, says Orengo","Senate Minority leader James Orengo has described the recent IEBC tweet referring to the BBI as the ‘Burning’ Bridges Initiative as no innocent mistake but a revelation of its mindset.The Siaya senator, a close ally of ODM leader Raila Odinga, said the tweet, which was pulled down by the electoral agency, was not a typo as Kenyans are made to believe.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) on Wednesday tweeted the offending statement and immediately pulled it down and apologised.“Happening now: The launch of the Burning Bridges Initiative Supporters Verification Exercise at the Bomas of Kenya,” the tweet read.It was posted on a day IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati led the launch of the BBI signatures verification exercise.The tweet caused an uproar among Kenyans on Twitter, forcing the commission to apologise, saying it was an error.“Earlier today, the commission posted a tweet on the launch of the verification of BBI supporters. However, there was a typographical error in the tweet which was made inadvertently. The error does NOT in any way reflect the position of the commission or its staff.""The commission sincerely apologises to all its stakeholders and the general public,"" it said.But Orengo has insisted that the tweet was not an innocent mistake, adding that it revealed the commission’s subconscious feelings about the proposed constitutional amendment.“The tweet about BBI by the IEBC was more than a simple Freudian Slip. It was a glaring exposition of the mindset of the commission,” the lawmaker said.""It was not without significance that I described it as a criminal enterprise some time back. I have not changed my views an iota.”"
687,Which way for university online learning after pandemic?,"Covid-19 triggered the closure of universities, disrupting traditional face-to-face learning, thus compelling majority to migrate to online.The pandemic exposed Kenyans to the realities of education in ways not previously thought of.Through the internet, learners were engaged in university tutorials as many students enrolled for the new learning and teaching dispensation.Several Kenyans had previously not embraced online courses despite its existence even before coronavirus.Margaret Njeri, a fourth year School of Arts student at Moi University is one such learner who was forced to adjust to the new normal brought about by the health crisis.Moi University recalled its final year students in October as part of the institution's phased reopening.By October, there was still an upsurge in Kenya's Covid-19 cases and especially a spike in virus related deaths.The Ministry of Education was still skeptical about resumption of face to face learning.Njeri told the Star that for three months, together with her classmates at Moi University, underwent a blended learning programme where lectures were conducted both online and occasional face to face.""I took seven units and three were taught strictly online. While two were taught physically, the others were taught virtually from time to time,"" Njeri told the Star.She, however, notes that, like most of her classmates, she prefers the virtual learning compared to the traditional face to face.""If only learning online was free, I would suggest we do away with physical classes even post the pandemic,"" Njeri said regrettably.Even though online long-distance learning has been emphasized in the past months, many students have missed out due to lack of resources.A majority of eLearning content is premised on a student’s ability to access the same through internet-ready devices and the availability of reliable internet connectivity.Although access to reliable internet connectivity in Kenya has grown exponentially in the past decade, the same is primarily centered around urban areas. This places students in rural areas with limited connectivity at a disadvantage compared to their urban-based peers.Further, financial impediments and constraints may have prevented a significant number of students from being able to access online educational content, even if based in urban areas with relatively higher connectivity.So, the main question is what will the future hold for education and how will customers and consumers influence that?Dr. Mary Lonyangapuo, a senior lecturer at Moi University insists that blended learning is the way to go into the future.She observes that there were positive improvements in students' class participation in her lectures during the pandemic.""Students' attendance and engagement greatly improved and was remarkable. Probably due to the convenience of attending classes from the comfort of their rooms,"" Lonyangapuo told the Star.On whether the quality of degrees and diplomas obtained online compare with those awarded through traditional methods, the 18-year experienced lecturer disputed claims of low-standard degrees acquired through online learning.""Depending on the input, both degrees earned through online leaning should be the same as those acquired through face to face learning,"" she said.Experts have encouraged that institutions must borrow a leaf from colleges of distance education who have dealt with problems of remote communication.Dr Lonyangapuo reiterated the importance of capacity building in effective online learning.""If resources are available for both lecturers and students, I am certain that the digital learning can be very effective in Kenya. Aga Khan University Vice Provost Dr. Alex Awiti  once noted that the time is now for Kenya to have a flipped classroom where students have access to all the content they need, anytime, independently and away from the classroom.These include video, audio, readings, PowerPoint etc, distributed via social media platforms, accessed by mobile devices.This learning upgrade can only be possible if all learners have equal access to resources.Universities will have to conduct baseline surveys on the students to find out whether they have computing devices such as laptops, tablets, smart phones; whether they have connection to electric power, broadband internet, access, with acceptable speed and reliability, affordability of and access to wifi and data bundles.Students who cannot be on board because of these constraints must be sought and their problems addressed.Those who have no connection to power may have to move from rural to urban centres where there is electricity.A lot of money is needed to solve such problems, at least in part.The Higher Education Loans Board on December 7 announced plans to provide at least 60,000 laptops to new government-sponsored students.It has requested the Treasury provide about Sh2.5 billion for the project.If approved by the Treasury, about 60,000 students next year will be able to apply a portion of their Helb loan to buy a laptop.Varsities have also been advised to re-look their budgets and do virements — move money from some vote —heads to where money is needed more.Some institutions have already started investing in this new learning programme. Zetech University injected Sh8 million into improving its digital learning and management infrastructure.Vice chancellor Njenga Munene said during a virtual graduation ceremony in November that the initiative has enabled students to get value out of online learningHe said the monies has enabled the institution to handle new students who want to complete their coursework on time.More universities should follow suit."
688,Why some women face delays in conception,"When Mildred, 40, was ready to get pregnant, she and her husband went to the hospital and her contraceptive was removed.She had an IUD for five years before she made up her mind she wanted a child.Having been married for five years, Mildred said they agreed to have their firstborn when they turned 40.“So we went to a clinic in Nairobi and the contraceptive was removed. And we started trying to get a baby. We had been led to believe that getting pregnant is way easier than it actually is,” she said.It's well known that it's more difficult for older women to get pregnant. But there are other reasons.Mildred said after a year, she did not conceive and started to worry.“I began doubting my capabilities. What if I was the problem? I visited the hospital but was told that I was fertile. So what was the problem?” she asked.She said her five-year marriage began crumbling as her husband didn't understand why she wasn't pregnant though they had tried for months.“I started being frustrated. I started using herbs to ensure that I got pregnant. This did not work. I started fasting because maybe my sins were catching up with me,” she said.After two years of struggle, Mildred finally got pregnant. Research published in the British Medical Journal indicates that how quickly a woman becomes pregnant depends on the type of contraceptive she used.Women who came off injectable contraceptives, the report indicated, had to wait for five to eight months to become pregnant, while those who stopped using patches had a four-month wait.Users of the Pill took, on average, three months, while women who stopped using implants, including IUDs, reported getting pregnant two months later. Speaking to the Star, obstetrician and gynaecologist John Nyamu said use of contraceptives could hinder faster conception.“Some hormones cause delays in conception. This is when you are injected with a drug that interferes with your flow and also your hormones. These kinds of hormones will also ensure that your pregnancy is delayed,” he said.Nyamu said once a woman gets off a contraceptive, she should be given other medication to reverse its effects.“Once you get off the contraceptive, it will take you roughly three months to one year to get pregnant so you either must be patient or look for the medication for reversal,” he said.But Mildred is just one among many women who struggle to conceive after they stop using contraceptives.Natalia* 30 tells the Star that when she stopped using contraceptives, she was told that she could not bear any more children.With one child, Natalia decided on three-year spacing but when she stopped using contraceptives it took five years before she could conceive.“I went to my gynecologist who told me that my tubes might be blocked and that is why I was unable to get pregnant,” she said.Worried about what society would think of her if she did not get a baby boy, Natalia said she tried everything but there was no change.“I even visited the herbalists and turned to God but I could not conceive.Finally, a gynecologist gave her medication.“After a few weeks, I got pregnant. I did not know why.  Was it the doctor? The herbalist or God? I was confused but I was pregnant,” she said.Gynaecologist Nyamu said once a contraceptive is removed, the cause of delayed pregnancy should be investigated.“If it takes longer than usual, go for a check up. Your tubes might be blocked or maybe you have an infection making pregnancy impossible,” he said.Then, there's your partner.“The sperm might be of low quality but the best way to remove all  doubts is to visit a specialist. Check the cause, get medication to induce ovulation.”Among the 1.9 billion women of reproductive age (15-49 years) worldwide in 2019, 1.1 billion need family planning; of these, 842 million are using contraceptives. About 270 million have unmet needs for contraception."
689,Ministry to provide 7.5 million masks for needy learners ahead of schools reopening,"Poor learners will be given masks as schools reopen, the Health Ministry has announced.Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Friday said more than 7.5 million masks are available to be distributed to deserving and needy cases as schools reopen next week on Monday.The masks have been provided by the Chamber of Commerce.“We have also told teachers and parents that a mask is now part of the uniform; when you are sending your child to school with the school uniform a mask is part of it, and ideally two masks will be better,” Kagwe said.The CS has however hinted that the government will not hesitate to close down the schools again should Covid-19 cases soar.“There are very many countries that have opened schools and at the sign of an upsurge of cases have closed them and there is nothing that we have removed from the table. This is a fluid and dynamic situation and we will be watching very carefully,” he said.Education CS George Magoha is expected to issue more guidelines on the operation of schools ahead of the reopening, but Kagwe maintained that as the Health ministry they had issued protocols to guide the reopening to ensure teachers and students are protected from the virus.Some of the protocols are aimed to guide on the sports activities in the schools and how to maintain social distancing amid strained resources and amenities.“The more exposed and vulnerable groups are not actually the students given the asymptomatic nature that we have experienced within our young people, but the more exposed people are the teachers particularly those who may be having underlying issues and the elderly,” Kagwe said.He added: “Teachers have been advised to take very serious measures not to take anything for granted. We don’t want to lose nay children and we don’t want to lose any teachers.”The ministry has put in place measures to ensure there are officers moving around the schools and observing to make sure all is well, as well as carry out ad hoc tests in schools.“We have proposed that in our good weather if a class is too big and we can’t be able to social distance it can be better to do it outside.”On Friday, the CS announced that 156 more people had tested positive from a sample size of 4,317 with 11 people succumbing to the virus."
690,Allocation of affordable houses commences amid artisans' concerns,"Early in December, the first batch of houses completed under President Uhuru Kenyatta’s affordable housing project was handed over to homeowners.Some 1,730 completed units constructed at the Park Road, Ngara site were officially handed over to those who qualified through the Boma Yangu portal.The move paves way for the construction of the second phase in Shauri Moyo, Embakasi and Athi River where some 3,000 units will be constructed.According to Housing PS Charles Hinga, 310,378 Kenyans have registered in the Boma Yangu and Huduma portal raising over Sh463 million.Those who contributed the minimum 12.5 per cent (Sh187,500) qualify for the allocation.Hinga said the allocation for the Park Road project which is a mixed settlement considered civil servants and non-civil servants on 60-to-40 per cent criteria.He said the 60 per cent (822 units) have been occupied by the members of police and Kenya Defence Forces.He said another project in Rongai called King’s is  65 per cent complete and will be handed over to the government in due course.“We want Kenyans to understand and see beyond Parkroad, there are so many other developments that are going on. We have a huge pipeline of 5,551 units in different stages being delivered,’ he said.With regards to misinformation that the government is constructing houses for Kenyans, Hinga said Kenyans are now starting to understand what affordable housing is all about.“Homeownership is not a privilege for a few. And when we say affordable houses, it is not synonymous with poor quality. With the simplified messages we have been running this should help us tell Kenyans that whatever they are paying for rent, there is a package for them under the affordable housing,” he said.President Uhuru Kenyatta under his Big Four Agenda promised 500,000 affordable housing units for Kenyans by 2022 as one of the deliverables from his flagship projects.Hinga said some other 5,551 units are under pipeline on various stages of construction.The lowest price for the one-bedroom unit 30 sq metres is set at Sh1.5 million but there might be slight variation for projects not on government land but registered under the AHP programme through the Bomayangu portal.“Overall we shall have one bedroom of 30sqm selling at Sh1.5 million, 2 bedroom of 40sqm at Sh2million, 2 bedroom 60sqm at Sh3 million, 3 bedroom of 60sqm at Sh3, 550,000 and 3 bedroom 80sqm at Sh4 million,”  Hinga said.This will apply for houses within Nairobi.In Embu, a two-bedroomed house will cost Sh3.5 million while three bedroomed will go for Sh4.8 million.In Machakos, while a two-bedroom will cost Sh3.3 million, a three-bedroom will cost Sh4.3 million compared to Kiambu where a one-bedroom will cost  Sh2.25 million, two-bedroom Sh4 million and a three-bedroom with master en-suite Sh5.4 million.Under the same project, a one-bedroom in Kisumu will cost Sh2.25 million, two-bedroom Sh3.75 million while a three-bedroom with master en-suite Sh5.4 million.""Once a member has been allocated a unit, they will be removed from the AHP Purchase Allocation Waiting List,"" he said.So far, the government has identified 40 locations across the country with 20,000 acres of land being set aside to construct 621,523 houses.Nairobi’s Eastlands area is among the locations that will host these units, with a total of 186,242 out of the 621,523 houses. So far, 1,509 houses have been completed, awaiting allocation in this month.Despite this progress, a section of Jua Kali artisans from Nairobi’s Kamukunji Jua Kali Association have accused the PS of using proxies to get a Sh100 million tender at their expense.Those who spoke to the Star on request of anonymity said the PS lobbied for a company identified as NGOKAMKA holdings to supply over 1,370 doors to the just-completed Parkroad units of the affordable housing.According to them, Hinga handpicked and lured officials from the Association and artisans who operate along Ngong Road and Kariobangi and instructed them to form a private company behind their backs.In documents seen by the Star, the said company was registered on February 24,2019 and was subcontracted in a contract price worth 100 million two months later on April 30,2019.Its registered office is said to be at 1st Ngong Avenue, Building ACK Garden, House LR NO.209/8342/2.The company has three main directors who also double as shareholders alongside seven others.According to an agreement dated April 30, China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd contracted Ngokamka in a deal worth Sh99,895,883.86.The company was to supply 8,832 doors and door frames.The PS is said to have written to Mi Xiliang, the Project Manager China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd directing him to subcontract the company.“This is to, therefore, request that you fast track the negotiation in good faith with Ngokamka for the delivery of ring-fenced items for the Park Road project,” read part of the letter dated April 17. “Any support that the entity requires will be provided by State Department for Housing and Urban Development to enable them meet the demand and the quality of the products,” it read.But Hinga dismissed the claims terming them baseless.Hinga in an interview with the Star said he could not comment on rumours because no complaint had been presented to his office.The PS said the government does not involve itself in the consortium’s internal affairs.“I don't comment on rumours and there's nothing that is on my desk officially. Here they are. You can ask them who they are,” he said while directing us to speak to the officials of the company.“Part of the government is not interfering with private entities or whatever they are given. They were given the work by the contractor ask them how they share the work,” he added.We reached out to Joseph Ngure Muhia, the Chairman of the company who said the allegations were neither here nor there.Though he did not dismiss or agree to the claims that they were handpicked by the PS, Muhia said, “When a project is starting, everybody cannot be involved. Those allegations are neither here nor there because it is common knowledge that starting points always have challenges”.He added, “We are not a private company but a group company with 12 directors out of whom 4 are drawn from each of the three associations”.Muhia confirmed that they had only supplied 1,370 doors and frames worth Sh100 million instead of the over 8,000 indicated in the contract.Muhia also doubles up as one of the directors cum shareholders.Other directors cum shareholders are Eliud Muthiga Mbiyu and Peter Mwema Muthaaka.Shareholders include Eunice Wanjiru Mwangi, Jared Omolo Akumu and Joseph Mungai Mburu.They are chairlady, Vice-chairman, and treasurer respectively for Kamukunji Jua Kali Association.Others listed as shareholders include Edward Okoth Otieno, Daniel Macharia Kihanya, Cynthia Andrine, Wanjiku Kamau and George Gitau Wachira.Mbiyu when reached for comment said the company with a membership of 10,000 requested the government to be given an opportunity in the project.He said an official from the Small and Medium Enterprises department under the Office of the President approached the leadership of the three Jua Kali Associations and told them to corporate in order to get the tenders.“The government heard our cry. We were nominated from the three associations and advised to form the company. The government officials then introduced us to the developer who actually gave us the contract to make the doors,” he said.“This was a pilot project because again the government was testing waters to see if the Jua Kali sector has the capacity. We could therefore not bid for the entire population in Kenya to get the job,” Mbiyu said.He said the project is going on countrywide and instead of complaining those aggrieved should start preparations to do the next bidding for the Shauri Moyo or Embakasi project.The artisans however said they had felt betrayed by the leaders whom they said bided for the contract using their certificate.“We are a legally registered entity. They used our certificate to win the contract and instead of bringing the money here, they chose a few people loyal to them and started parallel operations,” one of the artisans said,“They are fraudsters because when we raised the concerns they split and formed a parallel-group with those loyal to them. When we persisted with concerns, they moved to court seeking to access our offices but the membership refused because we felt we were betrayed,” another artisan noted.According to them, if the PS is honest with the deal, he would have allowed each association to do its bidding and be subcontracted independently.""It is unfair for them to use our bank account for an illegal company without our consent,” another artisan said.The artisans said after the scuffle that saw the said officials ejected from their offices, tension has been high as a group of youth has been hired to target them.We are appealing to the DCI to move in ad investigate because this is a criminal matter. We cannot live in fear because we don’t know who is marking who,” they said.The artisans said EACC should help them establish the real owners of the said Ngokamka Company."
691,Westlands wine restaurant at the centre of trade mark dispute,"A businessman has denied claims of stealing and using the ‘Chez Sonia’ trademark to run a high-end wine shop and restaurant along Peponi road in Westlands, Nairobi.  In documents filed in court, Ernesto Gonzalez says he registered the trademark in dispute in strict adherence to the Trade Marks Act and that he is the legal proprietor of the trademark. The name ‘Chez Sonia’ he says was derived from his spouse's name Sonia Massioui which translated from French means “House of Sonia” “The registration of the trademark was done in full compliance with the Trade Mark Act and the same is now protected and it is no surprise that no one else can seek to have the name registered under them including the company,” says Gonzalez.  Gonzalez is responding to a suit filed by Salome Kiende Ibeere. Salome filed the case under the name Chez Sonia Limited. She claimed she is the one who registered the restaurant's trademark. She sued Sonia, Gonzalez and one Esther Muthoni accusing them of infringing the trade name which she says she registered as Chez Sonia limited. Salome in her court papers wants Gonzalez and Sonia stopped from using the name ‘Chez Sonia’. She is also seeking general damages for infringement of intellectual property rights. She says Chez Sonia Limited was incorporated in January 2019 to carry out operations as a wine club. Sonia was initially the consenting partner but the two fell out.  Consequently, Sonia according to Salome colluded with Gonzalez and Muthoni to trade the wine bar using the name Chez Sonia without the license of Chez Sonia limited. But Gonzalez says the insinuation by Salome that they ought to have sought license from her to publicize the trademark is ridiculous especially given that the trademark was already published in the Kenya Industrial Property Journal (KIPI) in August 2019.  Gonzales says they have no legal connection with Chez Sonia Limited but maintains that he is the proprietor of the trademark ‘Chez Sonia’ and therefore finds it ridiculous that the company is advising him to abandon his already protected trademark.  He has asked the court to dismiss the suit saying Salome has concealed to the court the fact that the name ‘Chez Sonia’ derives from his spouse first name Sonia Mansioui “Chez Sonia has become associated with the three of us and we enjoy goodwill among the general population. It should not be taken away from us through lies, ill-will and abuse of the court process, says Gonzalez.  Gonzalez is also a shareholder of Case De Sonia and Co, the company that owns the Chez Sonia brand."
692,"Don't get tired of Covid rules, war not yet over, says Muheria","The church has appealed to Kenyans to strictly follow protocols aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19.In his New Year message, Nyeri  Archdiocese  Archbishop Anthony Muheria said the war against the pandemic is far from over.""I wish to plead with you all Kenyans that we may fully follow these guidelines for the sake of our children, for the sake of our elderly and especially to bring to an end this pandemic,"" he said in a recorded message.Muheria, who battled the virus late last year, urged Kenyans not to get tired of wearing masks, washing hands and keeping social distance.""Please make it a habit, make a commitment to always wear your mask wherever you are. Make your commitment to defend your brother and sister through social distancing, wash your hands, do all you can. Also serve those who suffer and those who are sick.""On Thursday, Kenya recorded 207 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the total caseload in the country to 96,458.The new cases were picked from a sample size of 4,988 tested in 24 hours.From the new case, 190 are Kenyans while 17 are foreigners. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said 130 people from the new cases are males while 77 are females.The youngest is a five-month-old infant and the oldest is 84 years.He said that 262 more people have recovered from the virus, adding the number of recoveries in the country to 78,737.Three more people have also succumbed to the virus, bringing the number of fatalities in the county to 1,670.The CS said 662 people are admitted in various health facilities across the country, and 3,024 are on Home Based Isolation and Care.Twenty-eight patients are in the ICU, 14 of whom are on ventilatory support and 13 on supplemental oxygen, while one patient is on observation."
693,Businesses that flourished despite the pandemic,"Overall, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on Kenya's economy.Many businesses, especially Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) , received a hard blow.These independent firms according to the Kenya National Beaaraeu of Statistics (KNBS) 2019 survey contribute 33 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product. They are a main jobs driver in the country. Following confirmation of Kenya's first Covid case in March, the government closed all restaurants, bars and hotels nationwide along with other non-essential stores. As the country began to feel the devastating impact of the coronavirus, massive job cuts erupted as firms turned to austerity measures to deal with revenue shortfalls.The latest Kenya National Bureau of Statistics report shows that the rate of joblessness doubled between April and June to 10.4 per cent from 5.2 per cent in the same period last year.Hundreds of employees with Export Processing Zone firms were sent packing due to lack of raw materials and inability to export.Hotels, clubs and the tourism sector were also hit hard when the government moved to enforce social distancing that literally grounded nearly all socio-political and economic activities.Big hotels were not spared as hotels such as Serena Hotels sent staff on unpaid leave in June. Others such as PrideInn Paradise Beach Resort and Spa and Utalii hotels were forced to temporarily suspended operations until further notice.The Fairmont Norfolk closed indefinitely due to inability of the company to sustain its business.Meanwhile, some businesses were able to survive the storm better than others. Here is a brief look at these businesses.Liquor StoresKimani Njogu is a Wines and Spirits attendant in South B in Nairobi and according to him, he made the most sales during lockdown than he did most of 2019.""I had to be fast in restocking because people were eally buying in bulk,"" Njogu told the Star.The term Kagwe special gained its popularity during the pandemic as it was the term crafty Kenyans were ordering after the government said eateries will be allowed to offer customers only two drinks when they order for food.Kenyans took advantage of this to eat a sausage and two alcoholic drinks. They did this as they went to different eateries.The things Kenyans do for a bottle.House parties were also common during the Covid-10 period which aided the spike in alcohol consumption.Revelers saw an opportunity to consume alcohol in the company of friends while bars and clubs remained closed.Also, the rise in liquor sales can also be attributed to the fact that most Kenyans were locked in their houses with fear and stress or losing employment.EntertainmentWith a lot of time spent at home, many Kenyans turned to digital media for entertainment. Online subscription video on demand service, Showmax must have gained a massive subscription in the nine months of the pandemic in Kenya.According to an article by Forbes, Netflix, added nearly 16 million new subscribers during the first quarter of 2020, and its growth numbers more than doubled what the company predicted January. According to the article, this was the biggest three-month gain in the 13-year history of Netflix's streaming service.Online businessOnline retailers have fared well during the pandemic.More and more people preferred buying things online over the conventional method of going into stores. It gained massive traction thanks to increased internet usage from the extended time spent indoors.E-commerce businesses that did averagely well during the pandemic include the e-Commerce Delivery and Logistics such as Glovo and Safe Boda, Online Fashion Stores, Health and Beauty online retails among others.Glovo, reported a high increase in deliveries and cashless payments on its platform since the onset of Covid-19 in Kenya.The Barcelona-based startup applied a raft of protective and precautionary measures to its delivery operations at the beginning of the pandemic as the company prioritised the safety of its customer, couriers and partners.During this period, Glovo saw cashless payments made by bank card increase by 50 per cent and mobile payments by 14 per cent in Kenya.Hand-Sanitizing ProductsPersonally, I've seen so many hand sanitizer company's in mall stores in seven months than I've seen in years.Not to say that those didn't sell because  people were sweeping them off those shelves like hot cake.The demand for hand sanitizers shot up since the first day Kenya reported it’s index case of the coronavirus.From Pharmacies to Supermarkets, people lined up to get their hands on litres of alcohol based hand sanitizers.This was one of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s recommended way to contain the virus from spreading.Online pharmacy, My Dawa, told the Star there was a sharp increase in online daily purchases of face masks and sanitisers within hours of the the confirmation of a Covid-19 patient.According to an article by Forbes, the hand-sanitizing billboards, which have been popularized, are totally functional and beneficial for everyone involved: the retailer, the advertiser, and the consumer who benefits from using the wipes.SupermarketsApart from hygiene products such as detergents and hand sanitizers, Kenyans ran to supermarkets to stock up on their house supplies due the lockdown.The onset of the pandemic in the country left Supermarkets in circus as people pushed and scrambled for tissue paper on shelves.Supermarkets that were quick enough to move to digital services were lucky as most people preferred making doorstep delivery order.Naivas Supermarket was the first to make adjustment to fit the unprecedented crisis.The retailer on March 21 announced its partnership with technology logistics firm Glovo to reduce the price of home deliveries for shoppers to encourage staying home.This was for online purchases valued at Sh1,000 and above.The move was in compliance with the government directive to limit public gatherings and crowding in stores as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus."
694,The curfew that unleashed terror on Kenyans,"On March 27, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced that Kenya would commence its nationwide dusk-to-dawn curfew.  The 7 pm – 5 am curfew was one of the many measures put in place by Uhuru’s administration amid efforts to contain the current Covid-19 pandemic.This came after Kenya registered its first Covid-19-related death at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi.The deceased, a 66-year-old Kenyan male, was being treated for diabetes.Earlier, the number of infected people had increased to 31 when two more people were reported to have tested positive for the SARs-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.On the same day, the country announced that the counties of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale were hotspots for the spread of the SARs-Cov-2 virus.When the President announced the curfew directive, he, however, exempted 13 groups of workers offering essential services.These include all categories of medical and health workers, national security, food and fuel distributors and retailers and licensed media.Kenya’s police have a reputation for being heavy-handed even without the excuse of enforcing a nationwide curfew, but no one anticipated the brutality that was about to take place following Uhuru’s order. Baton-wielding police were immediately deployed across the country as people rushed to get home before the curfew time. However, with fear spread across the country, a confrontation was expected.  Many Kenyans across the country who violated the curfew were whipped and some had guns pointed at them.Photos and videos have gone viral showing police using rungus and whips to 'discipline' those on the road after 7 pm.In Mombasa, residents were harassed and whipped by police as early as 4 pm, three hours before the start of the curfew.In a video that has sparked criticism over police brutality, police and the NYS are seen ordering women to lie down in water after being tear-gassed.The centre of the violence was the Likoni ferry terminal.Huge crowds had built up as commuters tried to get on ferries that were running at lower capacity due to new social distancing rules.Suddenly, hordes of police officers in riot gear appeared before throwing teargas into the crowds, lashing out at innocent men, women and children and forcing them to the ground.Dozens were made to lie on top of one another while others sat choking, vomiting and rubbing their burning eyes.In another video, journalists who tried to film the violence were not spared, some were assaulted by police though journalists and media houses are listed among those who are not affected by the curfew.In Nairobi, many residents were stranded in the CBD after matatus to various routes closed shop by 5 pm.Many commuters waited in long queues, hoping that a miracle would get them home on time.They were whipped and scattered. Women screamed for help.Some people were forced to trek home, dodging police and security forces.In the following months, police unleashed a torrent of violence on Kenyans.According to data from the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, at least 15 people were killed by officers during the first nine weeks of curfew alone.At least six additional deaths are also being investigated by the IPOA, as well as allegations of shootings, robbery, harassment and sexual assault by police officers.This brutality prompted a number of political leaders to denounce the violence. They said it would spread the coronavirus rather than contain it.Faced by public fury over police curfew brutality, the government said the ""mishaps"" were expected on the first night of the 7 pm to-5 am curfew.Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the 'incidents' had been reviewed and going forward the situation was expected to improve.""It was inevitable that mishaps would be there. Going forward, we hope that the situation will be a matter of the past,” he said.Kagwe rather said employers should release employees in good time so that they can be home in good time before the curfew.""We are all asked to sacrifice because of this situation and therefore it would be unfair for employers to hold unto employees for them only to be rounded up by security officers before they get home,"" he saidFollowing a public outcry, lawyers called for the resignation of Interior CS Fred Matiang'i over police use of excessive force while implementing the dusk-to-dawn curfew. Through LSK, the lawyers said the National Police Service had no right or justification whatsoever substituting the penalty imposed on violating the directive with corporal punishment.LSK President Nelson Havi said the penalty for contravening a curfew was a fine of not more than Sh1,000 or imprisonment for not more than three months, or to both and thus the action of police officers amounted to aggravated assault.“We condemn the actions of the individual police officers who have assaulted suspects. The Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Co-ordination of National Government who was declared to have contravened Article 10 of the Constitution should take personal responsibility and resign,” Havi said. “It is evident that Covid-19 will be spread more by actions of police than of those claimed to have contravened the curfew,” he said.But Police Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai in his defense said he never ordered any police officer implementing the ongoing curfew to terrorise Kenyans. In an affidavit filed in court, the IG said the police are supposed to implement the curfew within the confines of the law. Mutyambai dismissed the allegations by Law Society of Kenya of police brutality on grounds that he had not received any reports related to abuse of power. He said he could not act unless they report.  Interior PS Karanja Kibicho accused the LSK of pursuing a collateral populist agenda. “Instead of advancing public interest, the legal agency has chosen to pursue a populist agenda at a grave period when the entire world is facing a monumental threat on the very basic survival of humanity,” Kibicho said. He further claimed that LSK has not demonstrated any prejudice it will suffer if the order is issued under the Public Order as opposed to the Public Health Act as the agency has proposed. But President Uhuru Kenyatta apologised for the excessive force used by police officers.""I am aware during the introduction of curfew, there were some challenges. I apologise if there were some excesses that were conducted or happened,"" Uhuru said.He added, ""If we all work together, and if we all understand that this problem needs all of us and we all pull towards one direction, we will overcome”.JUSTICEAs a result, six police officers were arrested and charged for murders during the implementation of the nationwide curfew.Ipoa said the six officers had been found guilty of having directly involved themselves in shootings that resulted in deaths while implementing the curfew directives.“Following investigations by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority and upon an independent review of the case files by the Director of Public Prosecutions, six officers will be arrested and arraigned for various serious offences,” Chairperson Anne Makori said.Makori said Administration Police Officer Lotugh Angórita will be charged with the murder of the secondary school teacher, Ms Colleta Amondi OudaAccording to her, the teacher was shot after one of two police officers responding to a burglary incident opened fire at Usigu market in Siaya County.“A public inquest on the matter has been going on at the Magistrate’s Court but the ODPP has directed that it be withdrawn in favour of the murder trial,” she said.In another incident, four police officers are charged for assaulting Abdi Ibrahim Noor.The four, Festus Kiptoo Saina, Boniface Wambura Chacha, Joseph Mwaniki and Nashaon Adera are charged for causing grievous harm to Noor.Noor is said to have sustained a fracture in his leg during an arrest near Gateway Hotel, Garissa.“Police officer Duncan Ndiema Ndiwa alias Champes are charged with murder for shooting to death of 13-year-old Yassin Hussein Moyo,” Makori said.She added, “The boy was shot while at the balcony of his parent’s home in Kiamaiko, Nairobi on March 30, 2020. The ODPP noted that the evidence is sufficient to sustain trials in courts of law”.Makori said Ipoa supports officers in maintaining law and order but will not hesitate to act in accordance with its mandate, on the few bad elements that break the same laws they are supposed to enforce.Earlier on, the Authority said 15 Kenyans have lost their lives in the hands of police as they implement curfew directives.In a statement, Ipoa said the 15 deaths are among 87 complaints against the police it had received since March 27, when heightened security measures were put in place to combat the spread of Covid-19.Makori said the deaths were directly linked to the dusk-to-dawn curfew.She said the complaints include deaths, shootings, harassment, assaults resulting in serious injuries, robbery, inhumane treatment and sexual assault.“After preliminary investigations, 15 deaths and 31 incidents where victims sustained injuries have directly been linked to actions of police officers during the curfew enforcement,” she said.Makori said all the cases are currently at different stages of investigations.“Further, the Authority has dispatched Rapid Response teams to establish the circumstances that led to six other fatalities in the latest incidents,” Makori said.According to the authority, any use of force that leads to death, serious injury and other grave consequences should be reported immediately to Ipoa.“It shall be a disciplinary offence for a police officer to fail to report in accordance with these regulations. Following the orders of a superior is no excuse for unlawful use of force,” she said.ARRESTS The curfew directive has since then left scores of Kenyans arrested and businesses closed for flouting Covid-19 rules.Majority of those arrested are found drinking in bars beyond stipulated curfew hours, others found without masks while for businesses, operators not adhering to social distancing rules or taking temperatures of customers.For the businesses, the worst affected are bars, matatus and eateries, where operators adopted the ""business as usual"" mode.President Uhuru Kenyatta on November 4 while announcing an extension o the curfew to next year ordered police officers and county government officials step up measures to ensure Kenyans adhere to the laid down protocols.It is estimated that over 1,000 people have been arrested and charged."
695,Kenyans hit hard as new tax rates kick in,"Tough times await Kenyans, more so salaried couples, with the new tax measures recently enacted by President Uhuru Kenyatta kicking in on New Year's day.The Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020 passed ahead of Christmas Day will pile more pressure on households, with the increased minimum taxation on wives.Salaried couples will see their net income drop drastically because wives will now be taxed 10 per cent more.In the new tax regime, anyone earning above Sh32,300 will be charged 30 per cent Pay as You Earn.Those earning less than Sh24,000 will be exempt from tax while those earning between Sh24,000 up to Sh32,000 will pay at 25 per cent.A wife’s employment, professional and self-employment income tax rates will be 10 per cent for earnings above Sh24,000 per month.Those who earn up to Sh32,000 will be charged 25 per cent and 30 per cent for earnings above Sh32,333.The government had initially sought to expand the lower tax band to provide for 30 per cent to apply from Sh74,000 from Sh47,060.But faced with a cash crisis and dwindling revenue streams, the move changed as the government sought to net more income earners in the upper tax band.KNBS data for the third quarter of 2020 showed that 17.6 million Kenyans are employed, of which close to three million will be moved to the new tax regime.With the reliefs coming to an end, Kenyans will get less pay as companies are yet to reverse pay cuts imposed after the coronavirus outbreak.The only hope is an increase in tax relief to Sh28,800 from the current Sh16,890, but the longevity of the same is in doubt. The reduced Value Added Tax on goods and services to 14 per cent has ended, setting the stage for a price increase pegged on the old rate of 16 per cent.More trouble awaits loss-making companies as they will be required to pay a minimum tax at the rate of one per cent of their gross turnover.The minimum tax shall apply to all persons or companies whether they are making profits or losses.The National Assembly Finance committee chaired by Homa Bay MP Gladys Wanga said the bid was to “expand the tax base and ensure companies that make perpetual losses contribute towards enabling the government in the provision of services”.“The rationale of this tax is that even where companies are making losses, they continue enjoying facilities such as infrastructure – whose cost of construction continue to be serviced by the government,” the committee said in its report on the tax laws.Apart from individual top tax rate rising to 30 per cent and loss-making entities paying minimum tax, companies will also be charged 30 per cent corporate income tax.The tax rate was reduced to 25 per cent in April last year to cushion employers from the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and to keep their staff in the payroll.Non-residents will be charged tax on dividends for up to 15 per cent in what is likely to hit foreign investors and by extension on jobs created by such firms.Treasury seeks to raise Sh5.7 billion from the minimum tax; Sh28 billion from reversal of top individual income and corporate tax rates to 30 per cent.The measures have sparked outrage with tax experts, lawyers and business leaders pointing out that the new tax regime will impact the economy negatively.Cotu in a statement from office of secretary general Francis Atwoli said it was insensitive of the government to introduce punitive tax measures at a time when many workers have lost employment as a result of the pandemic.The trade unions cited concerns that only 2.5 per cent of salaried Kenyans earn above 100,000 and the majority of about 80.5 per cent earn below Sh50,000.""As much as we understand that the government is struggling to balance between saving the economy and surviving through the pandemic (including the health crisis), we believe that there are alternative ways the government can use to meet its obligations without being insensitive to the working poor,"" Cotu said.Federation of Kenya Employers boss Jaqueline Mugo told the Star that the ""withdrawal of the tax reliefs will make a bad situation even worse for both ordinary citizens and business.""""These measures were aimed to cushion Kenyans, stem job losses and business collapse as we grapple with Covid-19. So what has changed? We are still at the height of the pandemic so the timing is unfortunate. Employers had asked for the relief measures to be maintained at least till June 2021 when the current financial year ends,"" Mugo said.The Law Society of Kenya, in a memorandum to Parliament, said the introduction of minimum tax is likely to hit Kenya’s competitiveness as a business destination.They further argued that the rate of one per cent is higher compared than in other jurisdictions and should be reduced to 0.3 per cent.Lawyers also sought that the tax measure be deferred to 2023 in order to allow businesses to recover from the negative impact of Covid-19.Kenya Association of Manufacturers wants a minimum tax at 0.25 per cent saying the one per cent rate “is extremely high and would affect business”.Other jurisdictions such as Nigeria Tanzania, and Ivory Coast have minimum tax rates of below 0.5 per cent.KAM’s Phylis Wakiaga said additional taxes would impact negatively on the economy as corporate taxpayers are still dealing with huge losses occasioned by Covid-19.She said income tax rates were better retained at the current rates.“The economy is yet to recover from the effects of the pandemic and the extra income still necessary to cushion and sustain household needs.”Kenya Private Sector Alliance fought the minimum tax saying it should have been abolished.The private sector holds it would be used as a blanket tool to punish firms that cook their books and pay little or no tax.Kepsa said: “The government should extend the relief to its working citizens until the economy stabilises or shows signs of recovery.”Accountants body ICPAK opposed the introduced minimum tax and instead sought the collection of additional revenue through increase in VAT.Kenya Bankers Association said the minimum tax is regressive and anti-business, saying it claws back on existing tax incentives.KBA is concerned that the amount would be pegged on turnover as opposed to taxing profits and wants the proposal to apply to entities that have made tax losses in three consecutive years.Cofek said the taxes would not do any good as “consumers are still in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic and are struggling to adjust considering the higher unemployment, high food prices, transport costs and high energy costs.”“The corporate tax should be suspended and introduced in the finance bill for financial year 2021-22,” Cofex advised.“It is therefore premature, ill-advised, irrational and unacceptable to revert to higher taxes.”Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry said more than 50 per cent of all sectors in the economy are projected to make losses.“They will be denied the ability to carry forward the losses through the introduction of minimum tax,” KNCCI said.Treasury boss Ukur Yatani recently asked Kenyans to adapt to the new reality adding that the government is committed to cushion them from painful effects of the pandemic.The CS, in an interview with the Star, said the fall in export and import tax earnings, which are a major revenue stream, had posed a tricky situation.President Kenyatta is banking on a proposed Sh930 billion post-pandemic war chest to restore businesses and continue cushioning Kenyans.A Sh54 billion Covid19 economic stimulus package is being implemented in the current budget.Other jurisdictions are working to cushion their citizens, like in the United States where Congress on December 22 passed a $900 billion pandemic relief package.The UK, media reports show, has spent hundreds of billions on measures to support businesses and jobs and fight the pandemic.Germany reduced VAT from 19 per cent to 16 per cent and rolled out a $155 billion stimulus package in June.France unveiled a 100 billion Euro stimulus plan to kick-start its economy while South Africa rolled out a package of $30 billion."
696,Jobs and cost of living top fears among Kenyans - poll,"Kenyans are not worried about contracting coronavirus as much as they fret about the prospects of unemployment and the skyrocketing cost of living, according to a new poll.Instead, the Infotrak survey reveals Kenyans are anxious about joblessness and access to health care.The pandemic, which has made life unbearable for a large of the population, is a distant fifth in a list of pressing national priorities they expect President Uhuru Kenyatta's administration to give urgent attention this year.As at Wednesday, the country had recorded 96,251 confirmed corona cases, 78,475 total recoveries and 1,667 fatalities.Some 667 patients are admitted in various health facilities countrywide while 3,214 patients are on home-based care and isolation.According to the ministry of health records, 30 patients are in the intensive care unit.Despite the ravaging effects of the virus that was first announced in Kenya in March, Kenyans did not consider the respiratory disease a major issue of concern.The research findings released on Thursday had unemployment rated as the major concern at 18 per cent followed by the high cost of living which polled 13 per cent.A Kenya National Bureau of Statistics report shows that the rate of joblessness doubled between April and June to 10.4 per cent from 5.2 per cent in the same period last year.KNBS’second quarter Labour Force Report shows the number of unemployed increased to 4,637,164 between April and June compared to 2,329,176 in the same period last year.The more than two million out of work shrank the number of people in active employment to only 15,870,357.In 2019, 17,790,800 Kenyans were actively employed in the same quarter. In the January to March period, some 17,586,961 had jobs.After unemployment and cost of living, Kenyans listed the ability to access health care as number two concern at 10 per cent followed closely by corruption at seven per cent.The study by Infotrak Research and Consulting shows that an overwhelming majority – 95 per cent of those interviewed – felt 2020 was the most difficult year in their lives.The study commissioned by Infotrak had 800 respondents with 3.5+/- margin of error and 95 per cent level of confidence.It was conducted between December 27 to December 29, 2020, across 24 counties in the former eight provinces.About 44 per cent of those who said 2020 was the most difficult year cited financial instability as the biggest reason for their response.With 24 per cent having lost their jobs, 21 per cent had their business collapse, while two per cent either lost a friend, colleague or relative to the pandemic.Coast region — whose economy is dependent on tourism — led in the number of those cursing 2020 with 72 per cent saying they experienced extreme difficulty, followed by Nyanza region with 64 per cent.Coast experienced unprecedented closure of hotels following the outbreak of the pandemic which led to flight restrictions from major tourists countries.A number of hotels, including three five-star beach facilities, closed last in the last ten months at the Coast due to the coronavirus, which has paralysed the global aviation industry.The tourism sector largely depends on the aviation industry.A record 62 per cent of Nairobi residents listed 2020 as their worst year, 61 per cent respondents from Western and Eastern also admitted to having experienced extreme difficulty navigating the year that corona wreaked havoc in the country.The situation slightly dropped in Northeastern (60 per cent), Rift Valley (59 per cent) and Central Kenya (54 per cent).The year also had many people confessing to not celebrating the festive season as they used to, with 77 per cent saying they were unable to spend the festive as they have in the past.“A total of 61 per cent failed to celebrate this festive period as they would have liked due to financial constraints,” Infotrak’s Walter Nyabundi said when he released the research findings.Despite the ravaging effects of the pandemic, 61 per cent of those polled were very optimistic that the New Year will be better than 2020.Optimism for the New Year was highest in North Eastern, with 70 per cent of the surveyed respondents in that region stating they were optimistic about 2021.Nairobi had 67 per cent optimism level, followed by Central 65 per cent and Rift Valley 61 per cent.Coast, Western and Nyanza regions recorded the lowest hope for 2021 with 55 per cent, 57 per cent and 58 per cent respectively.Majority of respondents (27 per cent) who were optimistic of a better 2021 expressed confidence that the country’s economy will improve while 15 per cent were upbeat that citizens will get vaccinations against Covid-19.“Asked why they think that 2021 will be better than 2020, 14 per cent said their finances will improve, while 10 per cent stated they will get a job and nine per cent strongly believed their business will expand and grow,” Nyabundi stated.However, 36 per cent of respondents expressed fears that the economy will worsen with 15 per cent were fearful that Covid-19 will continue to take lives and destroy livelihoods.A further nine per cent of those not optimistic about the New Year cited the Building Bridges Initiative referendum, saying it is likely to divide the country with another eight per cent linking the law change drive to heightened ethnic tensions and rivalry."
697,Why 2021 will shape Raila’s political future,"A constitutional referendum, a push to fire electoral agency bosses and barely time to put his house in order for 2022 are some of the issues ODM leader Raila Odinga will have to deal with in 2021.  With a string of losses in by-elections signalling his party’s waning popularity, 2021 will be the defining year for Raila to gather momentum into the 2022 General Elections.  Beaten in Msambweni by-elections, Raila will most likely go flat out in Matungu and Kabuchai by-elections to redeem himself and stop the hustler movement from inheriting what have been his traditional strongholds. Already ODM has withdrawn from the Nairobi by-elections where the ODM leader was expected to demonstrate that he still holds the key to the city politics.Raila has not declared he will run for president in 2022 but his handlers are adamant his name will be the first on the presidential ballot.Having lost the last three elections and bounced back, Raila hopes to ride on the success of the Building Bridges Initiative to bolster his 2022 presidential bid.  In both 2007 and 2017, the ODM leader took a giant step to work with the government but it is his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta that may benefit him more.Political analyst Daniel Orogo said Raila’s future will be shaped more by the outcome of the 2021 referendum.“It is a do or die for Raila. Depending on the outcome, he will march out as a kingpin with velvet gloves or retire to his political oblivion,” Orogo said.“In fact, it is Raila’s elder brother Oburu Odinga who opened the lid on Raila’s chances of riding on the handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta to ascend to the highest office in the land.”Orogo said the current constitutional discourse has given Raila a lifeline for his political career.“As it happened in 2005 and 2010, he is the biggest beneficiary of a contested referendum.”On August 3, Oburu said during an event in Siaya that Raila has the backing of the system for his 2022 bid.“Why have we not gone to State House when we have won the presidency before? It’s because there is something we have been missing. That thing is called system. And now we are with Uhuru Kenyatta who is holding the system,” Oburu said.But Raila distanced himself from Oburu’s remarks, terming them as personal opinions that had nothing to do with him.Still, Uhuru’s foot soldiers have amplified Oburu's remarks and endorsed Raila’s presidency.Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe and nominated MP Maina Kamanda are some of the close allies of Uhuru touting Raila as heir apparent.In August, Murathe said Kenyans should gear up for a Raila presidency.“We think it’s time Kenyans rewarded the years of struggle of Raila Amollo Odinga. They owe it to him. It’s like Mandela, and 2022 will be a Mandela moment. And we would also like to tell him (Raila) to be a transitional president who will then nurture the young generation to take over in 2027,” Murathe said.Political analyst Danstan Omari agrees that the law change process will cement Raila in the people's imagination.  “Baba is likely to remain relevant by putting his name on the ballot. Should William win, they will negotiate. Should Baba win, William Samoei Ruto will position himself or even swear himself as the people’s president. He will be the Baba of that season,” Omari said.Orogo warns, however, that should Kenyans reject the referendum, selling Raila will be a gigantic task. Consequently, Raila might find it difficult to convince Kenyans to consider his candidature after losing the plebiscite months to elections.“If Kenyans overwhelmingly vote ‘No’ to the amendments, Raila will be lumped together with the failed Jubilee government agenda. He will share the blame and the mistrust of Jubilee's misdoings,” Orogo said.“Additionally, his political comeback might be an uphill task since the narrative of hustlers versus dynasty will have been deeply entrenched and confirmed in the voting on the Constitution Amendment Bill.”The referendum is likely to be held in June, should the electoral agency clear the process to go to the counties by early next year. (edited by o. owino)"
698,Let’s look forward to a year of rebuilding and restoration: Ruto,"Deputy President William Ruto has challenged Kenyans to look forward to a year of rebuilding and restoration.In his new year message to Kenyans on Thursday, Ruto asked Kenyans to seize more chances and make up for everything lost moment.The DP said that 2020 has been a year in which the country's normalcy was shattered, hearts are broken, strength tested and our faith tried.""...but also the year we learnt the power of hope, solidarity, and the tremendous resilience inside each of us. In 2020, our vision has been trained to seek opportunity in the chaos, to see light in the dark,"" Ruto said.He added that ""It is my hope and prayer that, with the lessons we have learnt and our now sharpened capabilities, the worst is well behind us.""Ruto has also asked Kenyans to work hard and to do their best to define the new year as a moment of rebirth, and a time to shed the old ways.""...adjust our plans, align our priorities, and embrace new possibilities in making our lives, our communities, and our nation more prosperous, secure and joyful than ever before.""He continued:""With courage, faith, hope, and love, let us enter the New Year, marching boldly towards a blessed destiny, in the name of Almighty God our creator and protector.""Earlier on, President Uhuru Kenyatta had conveyed his New Year Message to Kenyans.Uhuru asked Kenyans to build back better.The president reminded Kenyans that the dawn of a new year is not just a calendar event that marks the passage of time.""It symbolises transition, renewed hope, new opportunities, and limitless possibilities. A New Year brings with it the chance for rebirth, renewal as well as restoration,"" Uhuru said."
699,Uhuru's 2021 message to Kenyans: Build back better,"Build back better.This is President Uhuru Kenyatta's message to Kenyans, hours before citizens cross over to 2021.While delivering his New Year speech on Thursday night, Uhuru urged Kenyans to look forward to a better year in 2021.In his message, the president reminded Kenyans that the dawn of a new year is not just a calendar event that marks the passage of time.""It symbolises transition, renewed hope, new opportunities, and limitless possibilities. A New Year brings with it the chance for rebirth, renewal as well as restoration,"" Uhuru said.He added that ""But we cannot experience the ‘newness’ of a new year without a renewal of minds. I say so because you cannot seize the opportunities and limitless possibilities of 2021, if we are stuck in the mind-set of the old year 2020 and the previous years.""The president urged Kenyans to adjust their mind-set and to embrace the spirit of renewal and hope, possibilities, growth as well as triumph.He noted that Kenyans cannot wish away the woes of 2020, but that if the country changes its perspective, it can bounce back and bounce back better.""I know that we cannot reverse our losses, but we can rebuild what we had before the onset of Covid-19.""He also said urged Kenyans to usher in the new year knowing that the amendment of the constitution is still on course.""The proposed first amendment to our constitution in 2021, I believe, is a bold path that seeks to lay the foundation for a juster, more inclusive, more equitable, and more prosperous Kenya. It also seeks to make right our politics by eliminating “Winner Takes All” and replacing it with “We All Win”.The president has also lauded the efforts of the healthcare workers who are at the forefront in the fight against coronavirus.""I wish to recognise and thank our medics, our healthcare workers, our security forces for their exemplary courage and sacrifice during the continued Covid-19 pandemic. Each and every one of them is a hero in our eyes.""Uhuru added that the schools will be reopened on January 4, 2021, assuring both learners and parents as well as guardians that the government will do everything to ensure their health and safety remains our foremost consideration.""To every farmer, teacher, artisan, artist, to every worker and entrepreneur, to every innovator and to every investor; I wish to assure you that 2021 is the year of Building Back Better, building back better for the opportunity, building back better for reclaiming lost ground, and for realising greater growth as well as opportunity and possibility."""
700,Kenya shelves plan to ban flights from UK over new virus strain,"Kenya has decided to shelve the plan to restrict all flights from the UK over reports of a mutant Covid-19 strain.In his last address, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe had said that various state agencies were in discussion to reconsider a possible restriction of international flights in an effort to curb the situation.The government instead opted to issue stricter measures which will be applied to passengers jetting in from the UK instead of a total ban of flights.Already, Kenyan scientists have increased surveillance of the coronavirus after the new mutations were reported in South Africa and the UK.Reports indicate that the new strain has been detected in Nigeria, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Australia.“We have very strict travel measures with the UK which the US and the Europeans did not have. We are carefully observing every passenger traveling from there,” Kagwe said on Tuesday.Kagwe said the country needed additional recommendations from other agencies such as the World Health Organisations (WHO) to be able to arrive at decisions such as banning flights.WHO had reported that the virus was mutating at a ‘much slower rate’ than seasonal influenza, but officials from the UK said the mutation of the virus was allowing it to spread more easily.So far, no mutated strain has been reported in Kenya but experts warned it could happen.“We will therefore make decisions based on scientific advice as well as any additional advice from the WHO. We are not part of the European Union,” Kagwe said.The ban could have caused a negative impact on Kenya Airways which operates direct flights to and from the Heathrow International Airport.The KQ which has been declaring losses relies on such routes with the hope of growing its revenue.The discovery of the new strain sowed new panic in a pandemic that has killed almost 1.7 million people worldwide, showing that the new variant could be up to 70 per cent more transmissible than the original strain of the virus.Initial reports indicated that the new strain spreads faster but does not appear to be deadlier than the original virus.It was not however immediately clear whether the rapid spread was due to mutation or people’s laxity in protecting themselves.“We have seen an estimate of a small increase in the reproductive number by the UK, which could mean the virus is more contagious or spreads more easily in colder months. It could also mean that people are getting lax about following public health protocols,” WHO health emergencies programme executive director Mike Ryan said.In June, Kenya Medical Research Institute released results of genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 revealing that nine lineages were circulating in Kenya, mainly from Europe.There was no significant mutation to account for a new strain in Kenya.A mutation is a change in the virus’ genome, the set of genetic instructions that contain all the information the virus needs to function.“The current mutation in the UK is not unusual because viruses are continually changing. We are monitoring people arriving from outside and sequencing our own strain to see if any mutation is more or less dangerous,” Prof Omu Anzala, a virologist, said.Although there is a rare chance a virus could mutate to become more aggressive, RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to mutate into weaker versions."
701,Big names that toppled in anti-graft war,"The arrest of three governors, a number of state officers and the sentencing of an MP headlined the Jubilee administration’s anti-graft efforts in 2020.The list of big names felled by graft cases is growing longer and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission promises to pursue thieves and net more in 2021.ALL PLEAD NOT GUILTYGovernors Okoth Obado (Migori) and Muthomi Njuki (Tharaka Nithi) are in court on charges of corruption.They were barred from accessing their offices. Anti-graft detectives acted on the precedent-setting legal opinion by Justice Mumbi Ngugi that they be barred lest they tamper with evidence and witnesses.She said the law excusing elected leaders from suspension at half pay when charged with economic crimes is unconstitutional.The decision made work easier for detectives, ending their frustration with prosecuting persons holding plum jobs.The Senate in January voted to impeach Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu on charges of corruption. His seat was taken by his deputy, James Nyoro.Nairobi MCAs voted to remove Governor Mike Sonko on charges of abuse of office, violation of the Constitution, and gross misconduct.The governor was barred from accessing his office following his arraignment for a fraudulent Sh357 million garbage collection deal. Both Waititu and Sonko were arrested in 2019.EACC also got a landmark win in the fight against corruption in the sentencing of Sirisia MP John Waluke.The lawmaker was fined Sh727 million for a Sh313 million maize fraud and so was his co-accused Grace Wakhungu, the mother of former Environment Cabinet Secretary Judy Wakhungu.Garrissa Governor Korane is in the dock over alleged misappropriation of a World Bank grant of Sh233 million for an urban upgrade.He was charged alongside four senior county and municipal officials.The arrest came barely a day after the court granted Governor Njuki bail in the case of irregular awarding of a Sh34.5 million solid waste project tender.He and his co-accused were prohibited from accessing their offices - unless accompanied by an EACC official.Obado is out on Sh20 million bond on charges of Sh73 million fraud and was also prohibited from accessing his office.Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji also approved the prosecution of Lari MP Jonah Mburu and members of the Lari Constituency Development Fund committee for alleged embezzlement of Sh27 million.Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa was charged with misappropriation of Sh57.7 million from the constituency fund kitty.In August, the DPP approved charges against former Kenya Ports Authority managing director Daniel Manduku over irregular procurement of works.Haji also approved the prosecution of Masai Mara University Vice Chancellor Mary Walingo on allegations of embezzling Sh177 million.She was arraigned in Nakuru alongside two deputy vice chancellors and her driver Hassan Abdi.Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa was also charged at the Kajiado law courts with allegedly obtaining Sh450,000 in a car sale case.Kenya School of Law CEO Morris Kiwinda and seven employees  were also booked on charges of conspiracy to defraud the law school.They were charged with fraudulently paying Sh198.4 million for goods not supplied.A clerk attached to Justice Roseline Aburili was also fined Sh1.2 million in a Sh50,000 bribery case.Nairobi MCAs David Mberia, Jared Okoth Okode and Abraham Njihia Mwang were taken to court in a Sh1 million bribery case.They are accused of soliciting the money from Kiragu Waichahi Schools as protection fees against prosecution on allegations the school was built on public land.Agricultural Finance Corporation legal services manager Rashid Ngaira was also arrested for allegedly demanding a Sh3.5 million bribe from a client.He is said to have claimed to be in a position to restructure a loan the client owed to the corporation.A former KPA finance manager Patrick Nyoike, his wife Jacinta and KPA clerk Isaac Obunga were arraigned over alleged Sh214 million graft.Some 31 Kenya Revenue Authority employees were also charged with abetting tax evasion.They allegedly sought to issue tax compliance statements to individuals and companies with outstanding tax liabilities, in the virtually endless list of cases dealt with this year.EACC Chief Executive Officer Twalib Mbarak said the cases are just the tip of the iceberg, the beginning of their efforts to rid the country of graft.He said the successful prosecutions follow efforts put into prevention, enforcement and recovery of stolen public assets.The EACC, he said, is banking on the national anti-corruption policy for a comprehensive, coordinated and integrated framework for the fight.Despite the concerted efforts by the multi-agency teams dealing with graft, the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency hit the headlines over a Sh7.8 billion scandal over procurement of PPEs and other Covid-19 supplies.Senior officials, among them Managing Director Jonah Manjari, procurement director Charles Juma and commercial services director Eliud Mureithi were suspended.Following the incidents, Transparency International says more needs to be done if the country is to stop runaway corruption.TI executive director Sheila Masinde said much as there is progress in asset recovery, the returns are tiny compared with the resources stolen.She said it is important, though, to acknowledge the ongoing civil and criminal processes towards reclaiming stolen assets.“Progress has also been registered in possessing unexplained wealth in the hands of corruption suspects and other individuals.“These efforts should be complemented by a well-elaborated and open wealth declaration and lifestyle audit systems,” Masinde said.She raised concerns that multi-agency efforts to tackle corruption have been hampered by turf wars and fears of political and executive interference, in some instances.“Independent institutions in the anti-corruption justice chain must be given the space and resources to deliver on their mandates,” she said.TI said a system should be put in place for integrity checks on aspirants or persons bidding for public office.“Those with unresolved ethical issues should be denied clearance to vie in the next elections. The year 2021 should be the year to actualise a vetting mechanism,” she urged.Citing the theft and irregular procurement of Covid-19 resources, the TI boss said urgent reforms are needed in public procurement, especially of emergency supplies. She said the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) should regularly publish a market price index for PPEs and other supplies used in the fight against Covid-19.“A public information portal on Covid-19 is needed to enable Kenyans to hold duty bearers to account and insulate resources from misuse,” the TI boss advised.Masinde said the portal should have information, including resource allocations and expenditure, at the national and county levels.DPP Haji said there would be concerted efforts to secure more convictions in the coming year.“Conviction rates for corruption cases increased from 37 per cent in 2017 to 63 per cent in 2020,"" he said.Haji said this was as a result of the focus on high-profile and high-impact cases, prosecution-guided investigations, follow-the-money approach and inter-agency collaboration.He also dismissed claims that the war against corruption has been weaponised, a claim that featured prominently since 2018.“We only prosecute cases forwarded to the office of the DPP based on sufficient evidence,” Haji said in his report to the President last month.(Edited by V.

702,"Striking health workers, state resume talks","Talks between striking healthcare workers' unions and the government resumed on Thursday to seek a durable solution to the walkout and chronic problems in the healthcare system.It was a Christmas without most public hospital care and New Year's will be the same.The talks had collapsed after more than six meetings failed to yield an agreement, with each side blaming the other. Health CS Mutahe Kagwe and governors started issuing threats of sacking and withholding salaries.Many doctors and nurses have been infected and have died. Union officials  accused the government of abandoning the talks and resorting to threats and intimidation. The government accuses unions of politicising the issue and refusing to treat patients while their issues are being resolved.The nurses and clinical officers went on strike on December 7, with the doctors joining them on December 21.The Health ministry later signed a return-to-work agreement  with the doctors, which the other union call a bad-faith accord and a betrayal.Despite signing the agreement with the doctors, health services across the country remain paralysed.Nurses and clinicians urge the government to swiftly solve their grievances so all normal services can resume countrywide. Nurses and clinicians demand comprehensive health insurance, a Covid-19 allowance, treatment in a dedicated facility for Covid-19 contracted on duty, back pay, designations and promotions, hiring of more health workers, a national Health Services Commission and a continuous supply of quality PPEs.Poor Kenyans who cannot afford private health facilities mostly stay at home.“It is not politics when Dr Kevin Muthoni has been found dead in his house in Chuka after working for four months without a salary,” Kenya National Union of Nurses Seth Panyako said.Talks collapsed after the Health CS Kagwe and governors started threatening health workers. Insults over insensitivity flew.By Thursday, 34 nurses and at least nine clinical officers had succumbed to the virus while on duty. The number of doctors who have passed on stands at 13.More than 2,900 healthcare workers have so far contracted the virus, but the CS said some of the infections were contracted outside health facilities.“Stop calling health workers names. When you call us names we will call you names. When you say we are drunkards and we get Covid by drinking in bars. We we will also tell you you are a drunkard because it is only a drunkard who can tell us we are getting Covid-19 from bars,” Panyako said.The Kenya Union of Clinical Officers secretary general George Gibore said the union has since April been providing advisories and reports about the working environment and problems. All their reports have fallen on deaf ears, they said.The union suspended strike notices on two occasions to allow the government to take remedial measures, without success.“While the union has always presented itself and participated in all meetings to resolve the stalemate, it must be noted the employers have become hostile, politicised the demands and refused to sit with the union,” Gibore said.The new meetings were scheduled by the Labour CS Simon Chelugui.As nurses are key to the healthcare system, the fear is that gains made in the sector are at a great risk of reversal should no solution be found.(Edited by V.

703,"Terrorism remains our major security threat, Mutyambai says","The Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has called on the police officers in the country to ensure that the rights of Kenyans are respected while discharging their duties.In his new year message to Kenyans on Thursday, Mutyambai said that integrity, honesty, and true service are the foundation stone of spotless disciplined police service.“Our actions must therefore demonstrate respect for the people, honour for the offices we occupy, and devoid of any false sense of entitlement,” Mutyambai said.The IG said that the efforts to fight corruption within the service is unwavering, calling upon the police officers to continue giving faithful services to the public.Mutyambai said that terrorism still remains a major cause of insecurity in the country, adding that the security forces managed to thwart a number of planned attacks in the country.“We must remain vigilant at all times for our own safety, and that of the public.”He noted that there have been isolated cases of ethnic violence, perpetrated by cattle theft which has left a number of people dead and property destruction.To mitigate cattle theft, the IG has asked commanders in the affected areas to work closely with other security officers as well as other community initiatives to restore peace in the affected areas.The police boss added that road carnage remains a major cause of death across the country, lauding the concerted effort to bring back order on roads which has reduced the number of deaths being reported on roads.“Drivers, pedestrians, and riders must strictly observers traffic laws and rules. Direct every police officer to exercise their constitutional mandate on enforcing safety on our roads, especially during this festive season.”At the same time, the IG remembered the gallant officers who lost their lives or suffered injuries in the line of duty.“We recognize with deep appreciation their sacrifice and willingness to pay the ultimate price for the safety and security of our great nation and their people.”Mutyambai has also asked Kenyans to continue observing the Covid-19 protocols in order to reduce the further spread of the deadly virus, which has left more than 1,500 people dead since March 2020.Regarding the virus, Mutyambai has asked the station commanders to ensure that the cells are not congested."

705,Justice Gicheru abhorred graft with a passion,"A sombre mood engulfed St Francis Church in Karen where family, friends and the legal fraternity paid their last respects to Chief Justice Evan Gicheru. He was known for fighting graft, even among friends in the Judiciary, and for upholding  judicial independence from interference. Chief Justice David Maraga said he restored public faith in the Judiciary after many years of subservience to the Executive. Gicheru 79, died on December 25. He was the longest serving Chief justice, having been appointed by former President Mwai Kibaki in 2003. His widow Margaret on Thursday said he has been critically ill and was unable to communicate.  Her daily prayer, “God, let my husband only hear your voice always and no other”. She said throughout his ailment, God walked beside him.They were married for 50 years. Gicheru's seven surviving children recalled how he had several health scares over the years but always managed to bounce back.“Even recently, after a three-week hospitalization, you were back home looking brighter and fuller. You always held on. We have seen God work in you and through you. We are so blessed,” they said in a statement.“We shall do our best, na usiwe na wasiwasi, you have left your love, Mum, in good hands with us,” they said.Gicheru was born in Mutira Village, Kirinyaga, on September 16, 1942.He was appointed a judge of the High Court in 1982. In 1986 he was elevated to Court of Appeal Judge, he was appointed Chief Justice in 2003.His wish was to live  to be 120.In 1978 Gicheru penned a prayer at the midnight hour asking God to help him be rich in mind, soul and property. He also wished to serve and worship God throughout his life on earth, a prayer his wife said was answered. Chief Justice David Maraga flanked by other serving and retired judges mourned Gicheru as one of the most distinguished jurists the country has ever known. “He was an outstanding public servant who served Kenyans with distinction and humility,” Maraga said.In his tribute, Maraga said Gicheru’s role in restoring the public's faith and trust in the justice system after its many years of subservience to the Executive will always be recognised as the starting point for the reforms that today define the Kenyan judiciary. He further applauded his widow Margaret for the unwavering support she gave Gicheru when his health had failed him. “We know as a judiciary family Gicheru was not very well in his last days. It was difficult but that proved the love of the family for their patriarch. There are some families that neglect their own but we applaud you for maintaining the love of the man you loved until he parted,” Maraga said.Also present was retired Judge Aaron Ringera who eulogisted Gicheru as a man who believed in integrity. Ringera, who spoke on behalf of all the retired judges, said integrity and judicial independence were the two values Gicheru held dear. “He never interfered with our work. He let every judge do his duty according to the law and evidence presented before him. He himself was incorruptible. This was evident when he spearheaded the clean-up of the judiciary in 2003. He did not even spare his friends,” he said.President Uhuru Kenyatta, represented by Attorney General Kihara Kariuki mourned Gicheru as a devout public servant. “His death has robbed us of a gifted leader and one of the country's most respected legal minds. He was a firm believer in the rule of law and worked hard to strengthen and entrench the independence of the judiciary,” Kariuki said on behalf of the President.Court of Appeal Judges led by President William Ouko said they will remember Gicheru as one of the very few judges who was incorruptible and independent.(Edited by V.

706,The year Judiciary was besieged by controversies,"The judiciary has been in the eye of the storm for stands it took in 2020.Of course, nullifying the presidential election in 2017 didn't help as President Uhuru Kenyatta called the Supreme Court justices wakora and promised to revisit the troublesome Judiciary. He was reelected in a no-contest rerun.In 2020, Chief Justice David Maraga, who has just retired, rubbed top leaders and politicians the wrong way when he condemned what he called persistent interference with the independence of the Judiciary. To some he was seen as petty, not savvy and hard-headed but to the majority in the legal fraternity Maraga was seen as a heroe who stood firm and defended the rule of law, even if it meant offending the powers that be.For example, when President Uhuru Kenyatta declined to appoint 41 judges recommended by the Judicial Service Commission, the CJ in June condemned the actions of the head of state and called his actions unconstitutional.On one occasion when he spoke about the issue, CJ Maraga said Uhuru's refusal to swear in the judges has contributed to the backlog of cases  in the Judiciary.""You know I have respect for you as our President, you also know that I have unsuccessfully sought an appointment with you to sort out these issues but it has been futile, leaving me with no option but to make this public,"" he said on the steps of the courthouse.Maraga asked Uhuru to direct the Attorney General Paul Kihara Kariuki to begin the process of satisfying the decrees issued by the courts.""The President's disregard of court orders doesn't bode well for our constitutional democracy and is potentially a recipe for anarchy,"" the Chief Justice said.""I must remind you that you swore to defend the Constitution and the laws of Kenya. The laws include court orders. Demonstrate that faith and respect the rule of law and comply with court orders.""This did not bear fruit because to date the President has not appointed the judges, as required, but instead the state said that some of the 41 judges had integrity issues. Maraga asked for details and they declined; the cases are in court.Another occasion when the CJ confronted the Executive was when it was decided to place the Judicial Service Commission under the Office of the President.The CJ said the JSC is part of the Judiciary, a government branch that can't be assigned functions by the Executive. After all, the principle of separation of powers is supposed to be sacrosanct.In the order signed on May 11, the President assigned functions and institutions among ministries and state departments, superseding Executive Order No. 1 of 2018 (Revised) issued in July 2018.It contained portfolio responsibilities and changes made in the structure of government.Maraga argued that the Executive order cannot restructure or assign functions to the other co-equal and co-substantial arms of government and independent commissions.""An Executive Order cannot restructure or assign functions of the Judiciary or the Chief Justice,"" Maraga had said.He said the manner in which the Judiciary operates cannot be subject to Executive Order.Immediately afterward, the state responded. Attorney GeneralKariuki defended the Executive, saying it has done nothing wrong and blamed the CJ for misunderstanding the order.""Nothing in the Executive Order is intended to undermine any independent arms of government or institutions or to cause any confusion to the public,"" he had said.""The Executive Order seeks to provide clarity to ministries and government departments on their responsibilities with respect to the necessary and inevitable inter-agency linkages and liaisons.""Kariuki argued that it is the duty of the President to define for ministries and government departments such responsibilities and mechanisms for fostering policy coordination and the building of synergies between all arms of government.Another thorny issue that kept creeping back this year is the continuous decisions by the state to disobey court orders.The Judiciary has in the past complained about the issue but this year the problem deepened.Maraga again spoke about it and didn't receive a response. Instead, what ensued was a game of ping-pong in which the state kept accusing the Judiciary of frustrating the war on corruption. It was also accused of frustrating development issues by issuing unnecessary orders halting projects.And to make an already bad situation much worse, Maraga advised the President to dissolve Parliament over its repeated failure to implement the constitutionally mandated two-thirds gender rule. Many male lawmakers didn't even bother to show up, denying a quorum for business.It was the right thing to do and was within Chief Justice David Maraga's constitutional mandate, many lawyers said.It didn't happen.Politicians held several press conferences and excoriated the Chief Justice. Numerous lawsuits were filed to challenge the CJ's advisory to dissolve Parliament for violating the Constitution. The situation was so bad that money was withheld from the Judiciary, forcing Maraga again to publicly condemn the Executive.A number of court decisions also did not sit well with the ruling class. In one decision, the High Court nullified 23 bills that were passed by the National Assembly without the involvement of the Senate.Among the bills affected was the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, 2018 (No. 18 of 2018).Among the laws amended under this Act was the Registration of Persons Act that provided for establishment of the National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS), popularly known as Huduma Namba.On the Registration of Persons Act, the Parliament had introduced new definitions in proper alphabetical sequence and made a number of changes.The nullification came at a time when Kenyans were waiting to receive the Huduma Namba cards after President Kenyatta and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta - letters 'K' - became the first to be issued with cards during Mashujaa Day celebrations at Gusii Stadium in Kisii county.Now the scramble to replace the CJ has begun and the state is looking for a compliant jurist who will play ball and not complain.(Edited by V.

707,"Ambulances, military vehicles exempted from Nairobi Expressway pay","Transport CS James Macharia has declared the Nairobi Expressway as a Toll Road.In a gazette notice dated December 21, the CS said that the dual carriage with Class A standard that connects the Mlolongo with James Gichuru Road along the median strip of the A8 National Road are declared to be toll roads.At the same time, the CS declared the vehicles which will be exempted from liability to pay prescribed tolls for the use of the A8 Road Nairobi Expressway.This will also include the A8 and A8 South the Nairobi Nakuru Mau Summit toll road.These vehicles are ambulances, police vehicles, military vehicles, and some which will be specified.Macharia said the toll roads start from the African Inland Church, Mlolongo, and runs in the central service all the way to the James Gichuru.From Mlolongo to Crater Automobiles (15.71km), and the alignment is at grade.From the Crater Automobiles all the way to St. Marks Church in Westland, the alignment is viaduct and the length of the main bridge is 8.57km.The total length of the alignment is 27.12 km and is approximated to cost Sh62 billion.Users will pay tolls ranging from Sh100 to Sh1,500, depending on the type of vehicle and entry and exit points.It is expected to be completed in December 2022 by the China Road and Bridge Corporation.It will be a four-lane, dual carriageway being constructed along the middle section of the road between Mlolongo and Waiyaki Way and terminating at the James Gichuru junction.The Ministry of Transport estimates it will take only 20 minutes to get from James Gichuru Road junction in Westlands to Mlolongo using the road."
708,Thirdway Alliance unveils Miguna’s running mate,"Thirdway Alliance has unveiled Angela Mwikali as lawyer Miguna Miguna’s running mate for the upcoming Nairobi governor by-election.The National Elections Nomination Board assured residents of Nairobi that the two will be on the ballot come February 18 and urged supporters to ignore remarks by ousted party leader Ekuru Aukot.Chair of the board, Cripus Wathimba on Thursday said Miguna will be in the country soon to campaign for his candidature.“Do not ask me when or how Miguna will come but he will be in the country soon. We expect the government to obey court orders that were issued allowing him to return,” he said.Miguna, a Kenyan-Canadian lawyer, was deported on March 26, 2018 after he swore in opposition leader Raila Odinga as the “People’s President” after the 2017 presidential elections.Mwikali, a PhD graduate from University of Nairobi, said residents of Nairobi now have an opportunity of correcting the mistakes they made during the 2013 and 2017 elections.“Miguna and I have the competence to fight cartels and gangs that have derailed development in Nairobi,” she said.Addressing the media at a hotel in Nairobi, Mwikali added that she has been holding virtual discussions with Miguna, who resides in Canada.“We have been planning and strategising virtually but he will soon be in the country to join me in the campaign trail. The general will be back home to clean up Nairobi,” she said.She asked the government to obey court orders and allow Miguna back to the country.Mwikali unsuccessfully contested for the Embakasi South Parliamentary seat during the April 5, 2019 by-election.Aukot has disputed the party’s endorsement of Miguna as the candidate for the by-election.He termed the nomination as fake and a move engineered by rent-seekers within the party.Aukot is involved in a legal battle in efforts to retain his seat after the party’s governing council expelled him.The party’s National Chairperson Miruru Waweru however said Miguna shares the party’s belief that Nairobi cannot be entrusted to the hands of cartels and criminal enterprises.Aukot was ousted by the Party in September due to what the National Executive Committee termed as financial impropriety, lack of civility, and transparency to party members, and failure to attend disciplinary hearings.Secretary general Fredrick Okango said party supporters have indicated that they will fund Miguna’s campaign.“We have thousands of supporters who have said they are willing to contribute the little they have to fund Miguna’s campaigns,” he stated.He asked supporters to ignore sentiments by Aukot saying Miguna’s candidature was overwhelmingly endorsed by the National Executive Committee and the National Elections Nomination Board.“We have the NEC and NENB here as we speak. Do not listen to those speaking from the periphery,” he added."

712,"Magoha to headteachers: Be innovative, use tree shades as classrooms","The Ministry of Education has indicated that all the schools will resume learning in January 2021 after a long interference caused by the coronavirus.Speaking in Murang’a county on Wednesday, Education CS George Magoha urged school headmasters to be innovative and ensure Covid-19 protocols are adhered to.The CS said that the school heads can take advantage of good sunny weather and use tree shades within the school compound as classes.“If the weather is as good as now, nothing stops the headteacher, who is an excellent teacher from having classes there in addition to others being inside the rooms. Let us be innovative and stop criticizing without a solution,” Magoha said.Magoha said that there are no new classrooms across the world that have been constructed following the virus disruptions.He said that the schools will officially be reopened on Monday, January 4, 2021.The CS asked parents to prepare their children for the resumption of learning, saying the government is doing everything possible to ensure schools are conducive for learning.He also instructed teachers to ensure all children are given access to schools and warned them against sending children home for not paying fees.“Primary education is free as per the constitution but in cases where it is payable, we are asking teachers to identify the needy children and support them. Let’s not have a situation where a pandemic has occasioned the loss of jobs and then we send children back home,” he said.The CS further asked boards of management to handle expectant teens gently and ensure they go back to school.“When ready to deliver, they will be allowed to go for delivery and come back to school. Even those who are married, all students, especially candidates must go back to school so they can sit for the national exams,” he added."
713,Nurses warn of Covid-19 surge as strike enters day 24,"Striking healthcare workers have accused the government of publicising their industrial action instead of looking for an amicable solution.They have warned that Covid-19 infections could rise if the government does not urgently address their grievances.The medics said next week's full reopening of schools and with Kenyans coming out of the festive season could likely cause an upsurge in cases.The nurses and clinical officers have been on strike for 24 days. Talks to end the work boycott have stalled.As of Wednesday, 34 nurses had died of Covid-19 with another nine clinicians also succumbing to the virus.“It is not politics when Kevin Muthoni has been found dead in his house in Chuka after working for four months without salary. Kevin Muthoni has died without seeing a pay slip for a period of four months. It is not politics,” Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako said.“This is the only CS who has never met this union. You write letters, you want a consultative meeting or a courtesy call, it is cancelled. Then he says we are contracting Covid-19 in bars,” he added.The healthcare workers are demanding quality and standard PPEs, comprehensive medical cover, risk allowance, hiring of more medics and dedicated health facilities per county for those who contract Covid-19.Panyako said the nurses will not be going back to work until the government lays bare the evidence of medical cover provided by each county government.He said only nurses in counties that have met the demands will be allowed to resume duty.“Please don’t politicise our issues. We have lost 34 nurses and that is not politics. That is not just numbers. It is lives of mothers, grandmothers and sisters who have dependents to look upon,” KNUN deputy secretary general Maurice Opetu said.He added: “You have called us murderers and that has come from the mouth of a very senior leader in this nation. You have told us that we are not dying from Covid, we are dying from infections we are getting from bars. We want to tell you we can forgive each other at this time; we all tone down, and come to the table and reason as Kenyans.”The nurses have threatened to withdraw their services at the Kenyatta National Hospital and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital from Monday.Both are referral facilities managed by the national government."
714,[PHOTOS]: Kagwe inspects ongoing construction of hospitals in slums by NMS,"Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday made a tour to several hospitals under construction by the Nairobi Metropolitan Service (NMS) to inspect their progress.The NMS is set to construct 24 new health facilities in informal settlements in the city at a cost of Sh2 billion by the end of February 2021 in an effort to improve access to healthcare.Kagwe visited Uthiru level 3 hospital where he met Maganda Wanja, who donated her land for the construction of the community hospital.He then toured Kiamaiko level 2 hospital and Ushirika level 3 in Dandora before making an impromptu visit to Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital on Kangundo road.The CS then visited Soweto level 2 hospital located in Kayole.Target areas include Kibera, Githurai, Viwandani, Majengo, Kayole Soweto, Kawangware, Korogocho, Mathare, Mukuru kwa Njenga and Mukuru Kwa Reuben among others.Plans are also underway to elevate Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital to a level five health facility.“In my next 100 days, I intend to achieve building 24 fully functional hospitals in Nairobi’s informal settlements. The development comes at a cost and we must ensure we do not go back to where we came from,” Mohammed Badi said while taking over as the NMS DG.The project was officially commissioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta in August by witnessing the groundbreaking for the construction of a 16-bed capacity hospital at Muthua in Uthiru and Kianda in Kibera as well as a 24-bed facility at Maendeleo Village in Mukuru Kwa Reuben.All the facilities are expected to be completed by February next year for official handover to the government.According to NMS Health services Director Dr. Josephine Kibaru, 19 out of the 24 health facilities will be built from scratch while the rest would be rehabilitated."
715,"Make Covid-19 expenditures transparent, state told","The government should enhance transparency and accountability in the use of Covid-19 funds, an NGO has said.Concerns have been raised on the utilisation of billions of shillings set aside to fight the pandemic by both the national and county governments.Hennet chief executive Dr Mercy Onsando in a report said accountability and transparency were disregarded and overlooked this year with pre-existing frameworks for procurements and contracts not applied.The report says by the time the year started, the government had already secured over Sh200 billion from the international community including World Bank and European Union for the fight against Covid-19.In April, as part of Kenya’s Covid-19 Emergency Response Project, World Bank approved Sh5.4 billion.Also, Kenya’s Financial Year 2019-20 budget was revised, increasing allocations to the National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) by Sh8.7 billion; from Sh30.2 billion to 38.8 billion.An additional Sh1.1 billion was allocated to the National Covid-19 Contingency Plan while the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions donated Sh2 billion to the country’s coronavirus emergency fund. The report says some counties misappropriated Covid-19 funds.It says Vihiga only released information relating to expenditure on Covid-19 after a demand by MCAs, but the information provided showed that the funds had been misappropriated. This is after it emerged that the county's Covid emergency committee spent Sh10.2 million on precautionary measures and other logistics in the first 51 days of the fight against Covid-19.Over the same period, Kisumu spent Sh91.8 million on the fight against the pandemic despite there being no detected case within the county by the time the cash was spent. As a result, Hennet wants the government to post all procurement information related to Covid-19 on government portals to enhance transparency.“For better accountability in the expenditure of Covid-19 funds at the county, the national government should publicly disclose funds disbursed to county governments towards Covid-19 mitigation or support,” Onsando said.Hennet also called for a quick conclusion to the probe into alleged scandal at Kemsa.Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission disclosed that preliminary findings had shown that several laws on public procurement were flouted during the awarding of the tenders at Kemsa.EACC’s report to Senate health committee stated investigations had established criminal culpability on the part of public officials in the purchase and supply of Covid-19 emergency commodities at the authority.It cited irregular expenditure of public funds.President Uhuru Kenyatta in August directed the Ministry of Health to publish details of all procurements related to Covid-19 particularly those undertaken by Kemsa.Hennet asked the EACC, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the DCI to take action against the culprits.“Hennet is concerned that three months into the Kemsa Covid-19 scandal investigations have never been concluded and those responsible not held to account. This is despite President Uhuru directing investigations to be concluded in 21 days,” Onsando said."
716,"Release CDF cash so students can get bursaries, says MP","Many students who depend on CDF bursary might fail to resume learning when schools reopen next week due to lack of fees, an MP has said.Homa Bay Town lawmaker Opondo Kaluma on Tuesday asked the National Treasury to quickly disburse National Government-CDF cash so learners who depend on bursaries can benefit.He said constituencies have not received funds for six months now.“Since the budget was passed, Treasury has not given out any money. We are worried as leaders because we have many students who depend on CDF bursary for their schooling,” Kaluma said.He asked the Treasury to prioritise money meant for bursaries to ensure students do not waste learning hours after staying at home for months due to the coronavirus pandemic.The lawmaker also warned that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive on infrastructure and provision of face masks might not be attained ahead of reopening.During the State of the Nation Address, Uhuru appealed to MPs to chip in from their CDF kitties to address gaps in learning institutions in line with Covid-19 protocols.""Public day and boarding schools are overstretched and as a result, the learners are congested in classes and boarding facilities,"" Uhuru said.“Currently there is an urgent need for construction and equipping of more classrooms, dormitories and other amenities to further facilitate ease of learning of our children,” he added.The government aims to construct at least 12,500 classrooms and related school facilities under new cost-effective guidelines to be developed jointly by the ministries of Education and Transport.Last month, MPs sitting at the NG-CDF committee warned that CDF funded projects might grind to a halt expressing fears that it will be a tall order implementing the President's directives."
717,Journalists' union threatens strike at KBC over medical scheme,"The Kenya Union of Journalists has threatened work boycott at national broadcaster KBC to demand a better medical scheme for employees.KUJ said employees the scheme offered to workers was way below the amount deducted from their salaries.KUJ secretary-general Eric Oduor gave the KBC management up to Monday January 4 to address the matter or they call a strike.“We demand that the issues raised by staff be addressed by close of business on January 4, 2021, failure to which we shall have no other option but to declare the withdrawal of services until such a time when KBC will take health matters seriously,” Oduor said in a statement.The union also wants Director of Criminal Investigations and Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to probe circumstances under which an inferior medical cover was procured.KUJ is demanding administrative action be taken against managers at the national broadcaster who signed the contract without considering the benefits to the employees.“KBC management should account for the 10 per cent medical contribution for each individual staff who contributes five per cent of basic salary to the medical scheme,” Oduor said.He further called for procurement of an alternative scheme that matches the employee’s contributions.Last week, the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation instituted a review committee to scrutinise the controversial medical scheme after the union raised concerns.“The review committee has indeed vindicated the Kenya Union of Journalists  which had raised concerns over a pitiable scheme the public broadcaster had signed despite colossal amounts of money it collects from staff to finance the scheme,” Oduor said.He added: “Based on the recommendations of the committee, we demand that KBC terminates the contract, and immediately begins a fresh process that will ensure staff are given a better scheme.”The union also warned the management against intimidating employees.Oduor cited a recent internal memo to staff which he noted amounts to intimidation."
718,Kemsa denies claims World Bank donated ventilators missing,"The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority has dismissed claims that two ventilators donated to the Migori county government by the World Bank have mysteriously disappeared.There were claims the county was unable to trace the ventilators donated four months ago.The equipment were to be delivered to Migori Level 4 Hospital to help Covid-19 patients who needed emergency treatment. However, county Health executive Iscar Oluoch said they had been unable to trace the ventilators.In a statement Wednesday, Kemsa said the two ventilators were collected from its Embakasi Supply Chain Centre on December 22  by the Migori county chief officer for health Dr Dalmas Oyugi.“Kemsa received the distribution list of the ventilators from Afya House on November 19 and released the two ventilators to Migori county as per the distribution list,” the agency said.“Early this year, Migori County also received two Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines as part of government donations. We wish to assure the residents of Migori of our commitment to supply health products and technologies that are of high quality, safe and cost-effective.”There were claims the county had been given four ventilators but the authority mentioned only two.A shortage of breathing machines could mean the difference between life and death for Covid-19 patients in the most critical condition. That means the ventilators are crucial to saving lives.For patients with the worst effects of Covid-19, a ventilator increases chances of survival.“Kemsa upholds its’ mission of providing reliable, affordable and quality health products, technologies and supply chain solutions for improved health care,” the statement said.The machine takes over the body’s breathing process when the disease leads to lung failure in a patient.It helps patients who cannot breathe properly on their own by pumping air into their lungs through a tube that is inserted into their windpipes.Those who are put on ventilators are typically the sickest patients in the hospital, and any decision to have them put on ventilators is often made as a last resort to save their lives."

728,Relief as senators approve anti-doping law,"Senators on Tuesday approved the anti-doping law to ensure that Kenyan athletes participate in international championships, including the Olympics, next year.All the 28 senators who attended the special hybrid sitting (physical and virtual) voted to approve the Amendment Bill, 2020 to enable Kenya to comply with the world 2021 anti-doping code.Kenya had until December 31 to enact the law to comply with the Unesco convention against doping.The Bill, which awaits the President’s signature to become law, criminalizes doping and puts in place an enhanced result management system for anti-doping in sports by categorizing it as a criminal offense whose penalty is imprisonment.It also seeks to harmonize the Anti-Doping Act of 2016 with the 2021 World Anti-Doping Code and Regulations to which Kenya is a party.The proposed law was passed by the National Assembly a week ago before it was sent to the Senate for concurrence.Kenya ratified the convention against anti-doping in sports in 2009, making it a member state thus bound to international regulations on anti-doping.“If we don’t adopt these new codes, that have been added, Kenya is likely to be barred and banned from participating in athlete’s world from next year,”Kisii senator Sam Ongeri said.Ongeri chaired the athletics Kenya for 10 years between 1974 and 1984.This year, the convention introduced two new codes – the International Education standards and the international standard for results management – to put in place an enhanced result management system for anti-doping to eradicate the vice.The first World Anti-Doping Code was adopted in 2004. It was amended and a new one adopted in 2009.The current code was ratified in 2015 and is due to be replaced by the 2021 code which will become operational on January 1, 2021.“This is a very important bill. It seeks to harmonize anti-dipping legislation of 2016 with the current developments in the world of sport,” Bungoma senator Moses Wetangula said.He said many times, athletes have fallen victim to situations beyond their control and have had rouge counties helping their sportsmen and women to gain superiority in sports.He said many young, talented and innocent Kenyan athletes have seen their careers crumble because of rogue agents who introduce them to performance-enhancing drugs.“In between, we have people we call agents. These are the people who go around the country, scouting for young talents, but if you look at their history, infant, most of the monies they get-go to these agents. They should be punished‚” he said.He said such agents should be prosecuted and imprisoned. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
729,Impeached governors can't hold any other public office - Kindiki,"Tharaka Nithi senator Kithure Kindiki has weighed in on the ragging debate on whether impeached county governors are eligible to contest for election for a public or state office.Kindiki, an international law professor, said governors removed from office by impeachment, cannot run for election for a similar seat or hold any other public or state office.""Impeached governors cannot subsequently run for election to the office of the county governor or any other state or public office ever again in Kenya,"" he opined.The former senate deputy speaker reiterated that the lot cannot hold public offices unless their ouster are successfully challenged and quashed by a court of law.Kindiki waded into the debate moments after impeached Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu passed the registrar of political parties Anne Nderitu's test to run as an independent candidate for Nairobi Governor.The seat was left vacant after senators impeached Governor Mike Sonko. Unlike Waititu whose deputy was at hand to succeed him, Sonko did not have a deputy.Nairobi Assembly speaker, Benson Mutura, is currently holding the seat in an acting capacity for 60 days pending the by-election.Following the registrar's nod, all eyes are now on IEBC and EACC to see if they will clear the former Kiambu, who was impeached for abuse of office, gross misconduct and violation of the constitution, to run for the Nairobi Governor seat.Kindiki's observations buttresses opinions by other legal minds, including former Chairman of the Commission on Administrative Justice (CAJ) Otiende Amollo who argue that Waititu and Sonko and any other impeached governor or speaker, cannot hold any other state or public seat.""According to Article 180(2) of the Constitution, to be eligible for election as county governor, one must among other qualifications, be eligible for election as a member of the county Assembly,"" Kindiki said.In his observations, Kindiki argued that Article 193 (2)(g) of the Constitution stipulates that a person is disqualified from being elected as a MCA if the person has been found, in accordance with any law, to have missed or abused a state office or to have contravened Chapter Six of the Constitution on Leadership and Integrity.""Invariably, impeached county governors are removed from office by impeachment for among other violations, breach of Chapter Six, "" he said.He added that Article 75(3) of the Constitution bars a person who is removed from office for violation of the integrity provisions of Chapter Six from holding any other state or public office."

731,Protests rock Malindi over eviction by tycoon,"Demonstrations erupted in Msabaha area of Malindi subcounty after an Indian tycoon allegedly evicted 20 families from disputed land.The businessman accompanied by police officers stormed the land estimated to be 74 acres and demolished homes of the residents who claimed to have lived there for many years.Police are said to have beaten the families who were trying to resist eviction, leaving some with injuries.They later regrouped at the Malindi-Mombasa highway where they staged protests, closing the road for over two hours and demanding justice.The families said they will celebrate the New Year in the cold after the eviction from the only place they called home.Residents carried twigs, stones and pangas shouting and singing songs calling for justice.Mbarak Omar, one of the affected residents, wondered why the tycoon came to evict them without any court order.He urged Lands Chief Administrative Secretary Gideon Mung'aro and Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi to intervene and help them get justice.Omar said the locals planted coconut, mangoes and cashews nut which were cut down by the tycoon.''What the tycoon did was wrong, using police officers to evict people who have lived here all these years,'' he said.Former Ganda MCA Abdulrahman Omar said the locals buried their grandfathers there, having lived on the land since the 1970s.He said the Indian tycoon appeared from nowhere and claimed he was the legitimate owner of the land.Omar wondered why the tycoon hired police to evict the poor locals despite the fact that there was a pending court case coming up for hearing on January 5, 2021.""Police should follow the law. They used excessive force to evict the locals without any court order,"" he said.Denis Gona said the tycoon has no documents to prove that the land is his, adding that the locals will still go back and stay on their land.""We shall not move out of the land because the Indian tycoon wants to grab our land. The government should come in and help us get back our land,"" he said.Samuel Gona said the families are the genuine landowners and accused the tycoon of grabbing their land.Edited by Henry Makori"
732,"What parents, learners should expect as schools reopen","As schools reopen on Monday, things will look very different as families grapple with the aftermath of the pandemic.While most students will return to in-person learning in January, uncertainty still surrounds the right way to reopen schools.Different stakeholders have given suggestions to reignite the school system; however, each scenario comes with its own set of challenges, opportunities, and anxieties.Trapped, sometimes disoriented, and anxious about an unclear future, children now need communication, support, and guidance from educators, says Indimuli Kahi, the Kenya Secondary School Heads Association.Upon reopening, Kahi says that the institutions will be working to recover 23 weeks lost during the lockdown.In the recovery, he says learners could be saved from wasting any time that could give rise to the often fought early morning and evening remedial classes, Saturday classes, and possibly holiday tuition could be adopted in the rush against time.Indimuli says, without funding, activities are threatened and Covid-19 could jeopardize learners' safety.“The heads should also seek training for both teachers and learners in coronavirus prevention strategies. The training should be backed by continuous psychosocial support for learners as they continue to adjust back in school‚” he saysThe heads want a high premium placed on outdoor classes and remedial for upper classes allowed. Outdoor classes, Kahi says, will utilize the available space in institutions and ensure safe distancing.The Kenya parents association, chairman Nicholas Maiyo, says with all the pressure anticipated in the recovery process, the government should psychologically help both learners and teachers.“Each child needs someone to hold her in this confusing time, to help her into a place where she is seen, known, understood, supported, and customized opportunities to learn‚” Maiyo said.He advises parents to be more involved in their children's returns to school, work with them to create a schedule and invest more time in their child’s education than they have in the past. “During the lockdown, the conversion to remote learning was done in a rushed fashion by people with no or limited experience with remote instruction‚” he explains.Headteachers say that for school operations to fully resume, the government and parents will need to ensure funds availability.In the new calendar, the second term for classes yet to reopen will run between January 4 and March 19. This will also be the third term for Grade 4, KCPE, and KCSE candidates. Edited by Kiilu Damaris"
733,MP Koinange urges leaders to promote peace,"Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange has called upon leaders to avoid hatred among themselves to cultivate peace in the country.Speaking in Karuri on Monday where he held a prayer meeting with Kiambaa constituency clergy, Koinange said politicians should sit down with elders and speak about the future of their communities.“Leaders should know when there is no peace in the community there is no development and conflicts are very expensive. At the end of any conflict we lose a lot of money as a government which can be put to good use in different developments in the country,” he said.The chairman of the National Assembly Security and Administration committee said Kenyans should believe that there shall be peace in the 2022 General Election.“Kenyans should open up dialogue with one another and solve their differences so as to be in unity,” Koinange said.He called on leaders to stop hurling insults at one another. The leaders should also seek intervention of the church to solve issues.“Social media is being used of late to spread hate among Kenyans and it has brought division as most of the things posted are not true and propagate propaganda and will bring the country into chaos,” he said.He said that action ought to be taken against those politicians who engage in hate speech.“Rev Dr Samuel Kobia, the chairman the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, should make sure that whoever utters words that can bring any issues in the country, that can bring any insecurity or anything that can make anybody shed blood of the other, should be arrested immediately and taken to a court of law,” Koinange said.Edited by Henry Makori"
734,Blockbuster HIV drug linked to obesity in women,"The new blockbuster HIV drug called Dolutegravir is facing speed bumps after new studies showed it causes significant weight gain in women.Further, it does not achieve viral suppression in people who were already having resistance to other HIV drugs.However, Dolutegravir, also known as DTG, remains the most powerful HIV drug and its combination is recommended as the preferred option for everyone starting treatment by the World Health Organisation.Kenya introduced the DTG combination pill last year to replace older drugs as the first line of treatment.Data from two major studies conducted in Kenya,  South Africa and Cameroon show significant weight gain on users.The first study is the African Cohort Study, which enrolled nearly 2,000 HIV-positive participants between January 2013 and November 2019 at 12 Pepfar-supported clinics in Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda.People who used Dolutegravir/TDF/Lamivudine combination were 85 per cent more likely to develop overweight or obesity than those taking other non-dolutegravir combinations.Also, those on DTG regime were 27 per cent more likely to develop hyperglycemia, excess glucose in the blood often associated with diabetes.The data was presented at the virtual 23rd International AIDS Conference mid this year.In the South Africa-Cameroon study called Advance, men on DTG combination gained three to five kilogrammes.Women gained four to eight kilogrammes.“Weight increases were largely fat rather than lean body mass, and were distributed in the trunk and limbs,” says the study, also presented in the virtual 23rd International Aids Conference.Separately, a study reported in Nature Communications by the Advance team, shows that people with HIV resistance to drugs such as Efavirenz or Nevirapine, are less likely to achieve viral suppression even when they switch to DTG.“Further research is needed to find out if there is a resistance mechanism that explains the result or if it is behavioural,” researchers said.DTG remains the most powerful ARV on the market.It is more effective, easier to take and has fewer side effects than alternatively prescribed drugs, according to the WHO. It also has a high genetic barrier to developing drug resistance, which is important given the rising trend of resistance to other regimens.The drug is produced by ViiV Healthcare, a UK-headquartered company solely focused on HIV treatment.At least 76 per cent of the company is owned by GlaxoSmithKline, 13.5 per cent by Pfizer and 10 per cent by Shionogi of Japan.Edited by Henry Makori"
735,"Ruto allies: We're fed up with Jubilee, moving to wheelbarrow party","Some allies of the Deputy President William Ruto have claimed that he could run on a different political party in the 2022 General Election.Speaking a day after speculations swirled that the DP could ditch Jubilee, confidants disclosed that the intended renaming of the Party for Reforms and Development to United Democratic Alliance is part of their game plan ahead of the polls.“We left Jubilee a long time ago. We now have a new vehicle,” an MP close to the DP confided to the Star on condition of anonymity.The Registrar of Political Parties on Monday gave notice of intention by the PDR to change its name to UDA, raising speculation that the DP camp was plotting to embrace the party as his vehicle for the election.In the gazette notice published on Monday, the party also sought to change its symbol from a bull to a wheelbarrow with Kazi Ni Kazi as its slogan.“In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 20 (i) of the Political Parties Act, the Registrar of Political Parties gives notice that the Party for Reforms and Development (PDR) intends to effect changes on their particulars,” reads the gazette notice in part.The wheelbarrow has been the face of the hustler nation empowerment programme headed by the DP that has attracted a lot of criticism from supporters of the Building Bridges Initiative.With the new symbol and the slogan, Ruto allies told the Star that it is only a matter of time before the DP gives direction on how he will approach the 2022 election.“We were are fed up with that party [Jubilee]. What they have treated us to is enough. We are charting our own way,” another MP said on condition that he is not named.Ruto and his allies have had run-ins with Jubilee top leadership on key issues including fielding of candidates in the previous polls.In Msambweni parliamentary mini-poll, Ruto backed an independent candidate after Jubilee pulled out of the race citing the handshake.The MP disclosed that the renamed party could filed candidates in some of the upcoming by-elections ""even if Jubilee fields theirs.""PDR is an affiliate of Jubilee party. It won three parliamentary seats, one woman representative and a senator in the 2017 election.However, Soy MP Caleb Kositany and Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei who are Ruto’s confidants sought to downplay the claims he was intending to use the party.“There are very many parties in Kenya. Why is this one a problem? There is nothing wrong. It is just a change of a name of a party which is an affiliate of Jubilee,” he said.Asked whether the DP will use the renamed party in 2022, Kositany said, “That is not a problem. Maybe it is, maybe it is not. Why should we link DP to everything that is happening politically?”He reiterated that the DP and his allies are still in Jubilee.“There are very many political parties in Kenya.…let them continue with the curiosity, but they should be careful it does not kill the cat… let people relax,” he said.Former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama, who was reported to be new chairman of the renamed party, sought to downplay the report but hinted at leading a party ahead of the 2022 polls.“I want Kenyans also to enjoy their Christmas.  But there must be at any given time a democratic process that brings in a party that brings Kenyans together and I won’t mind being the chairman of such an organisation,” he said.He added, “If it is about DP Ruto, currently he belongs to Jubilee party. Ruto is the deputy party leader of Jubilee and DP of Jubilee’s government. But the party I will be leading. I will not mind to approach any Kenyan to come and join us.”Edited by Henry Makori"
736,BBI proponents hint at marathon campaigns from New Year,"Allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga have hinted on a back-to-back marathon of campaigns to market BBI in the New Year.Political confidants of the two political 'brothers' have revealed plans to launch aggressive countrywide campaigns to popularise the Building Bridges Initiative process.The campaigns will precede the submission of the BBI bill to amend the Constitution to the 47 county assemblies by the Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission.“We will unveil a tight programme from next week that will take us to most counties to popularise our bill,” said nominated MP Maina Kamanda, a key Uhuru ally.According to the former Starehe MP, the campaigns will be spearheaded by regional leaders leading various teams that will be unveiled “soon”.“There are regional leaders who will take the lead in popularising the bill in their respective regions,” Kamanda said insisting that the next three months would be key for the BBI process.He added: “We want to finish with the BBI process and move on to do other things, the referendum should happen before June or thereabout.”Homa Bay women representative Gladys Wanga told the Star that the BBI train will soon hit the road with major campaign programmes planned in the coming months.“It is clear that Kenyans are ready for a referendum, there is no doubt about that because we are receiving positive feedback from them. Soon we shall hit the ground,” Wanga, a key Raila ally said.Siaya women representative Christine Ombaka said the country is gearing up for a historic moment to review the 2010 constitution without delay.“We hope that we conclude the process before August next year so we can initiate radical reforms to required to guarantee free and fair elections in 2022,” Ombaka said.She added: “We intend to take the message to the Kenyans at the grassroots in popularisation campaigns so that they can own the document.”The Covid-19 pandemic had slowed down the BBI campaigns, but the process is expected to gather pace from January with the proponents maintaining it will go on irrespective of the measures.The BBI secretariat co-chaired by Dennis Waweru(Ex-Dagorretti MP) and Junet Mohamed (Suna East)is expected to be the focal point in coordinating the popularisation activities.The IEBC is working on the signature verification exercise before to ensure the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 is backed by at least a million registered voters.The Constitution does not spell out the timeliness within which the Commission must complete the process and submit the bill to the County Assemblies.However, the MCAs will have at most three months to dispense with the Bill before relevant speakers send them to the National Assembly and Senate for deliberation."
737,"How bars, restaurants weathered Covid-19 effects","In July this year, President Uhuru 'stopped reggae' for Kenyans shutting down bars indefinitely to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus.Uhuru also banned the sale of alcohol in restaurants and eateries, forcing Kenyans to enjoy their drinks from their houses.The closure of bars caused major losses for bar and restaurant owners as it meant completely no business for them.""2020 has been a really bad year for us due to the pandemic, this year has seen as operating with low sales of even 0.8 per cent from April to June with the ban of alcohol in restaurants,"" said Bavaria restaurant, head of operations, John Ireri.Ireri noted that most of the restaurant's clients were from nearby offices, and the work from home directives had offices empty at that time. The restaurant had to retrench workers from 40 to 16 staff to be able to remain afloat.""The delivery segment improved slightly with the pandemic but it still doesn't meet what we used to sell, we are hoping for a better 2021,"" said Ireri.Consumption of alcohol was now restricted to homes with purchases from supermarkets and wines and spirits shops allowed for a specific period of time.The consumption was also affected by the ban of gatherings and events such as weddings which traditionally drive up alcohol sales.The closure of bars, however, saw an improved performance of wines and spirits in various estates for the period.Overnight, wines and spirits (alcohol) outlets were cropping up at every corner, most next to or across where pubs are located.""Closure of the bars was a bad thing but it really saw my business grow this year, I recorded more profits than the previous years,"" said Stephen Musyoka who owns Bonanza liquor store in Mlolongo.The continued closure of bars also cost sorghum farmers, workers and the government Sh9.1 billion, according to the Alcoholic Beverages Association of Kenya (ABAK).Over 6,300 farmers will also suffer forgone revenue worth Sh419 million as the demand for barley and sorghum declines by three million kgs and 4.4 million kgs respectively.The reduced consumption of alcohol and job losses cost the government approximately Sh5.88 billion in excise duty, value-added tax and fees.The county governments also lost approximately Sh3.4 billion which accounts for the issuance of bars and liquor licences.ABAK, which brings together key players such as Kenya Breweries Limited (KBL), said that the closure of bars accounted for the loss of 57,000 jobs between March to September.For firms who manufacture alcohol, this plummeting business saw them record major profit drops.East Africa Breweries Limited (EABL) announced a 39 per cent drop in net profit to Sh7 billion for the year ended June 2020.On August 26, President Uhuru then set the stage for reopening of bars and night clubs after directing the development of rules to guide sit-down drinking in public places.He asked bar owners and the Ministry of Health to jointly develop guidelines that would promote social distance and hygiene in the quest to strike a balance between promoting the hospitality industry and curbing the spread of Covid-19.When the bars started operating this brought to life more than 20,000 outlets countrywide, a move that has given hope to more than 300,000 Kenyans employed directly by the outlet.At least 5,000 bars, entertainment spots, and restaurants had closed down in Nairobi alone with another 4,000 in Mombasa, according to the Pubs Entertainment and Restaurant Association of Kenya (Perak).During the closure period, March–September, gross sales for beer reduced by more than 50 per cent, ABAK said, a huge revenue deficit for KRA.With effect from June 30, 2020, spirituous beverages of alcoholic strength not exceeding six per cent attracted an excise duty at a rate of Sh110.62 per litre.Spirits of undenatured ethyl alcohol; spirits liqueurs and other spirituous beverages of alcoholic strength exceeding six per cent were charged excise duty at a rate of Sh253 per litre.Beer, cider, perry, mead, opaque beer and mixtures of fermented beverages with non-alcoholic beverages are charged excise duty at a rate of Sh110.62 per litre.KRA was also getting Sh75 per bottle of beer as tax, the slow return to normalcy was a relief for industry players and KRA which has been missing about 60 per cent of excise duty payable by the industry.Upon the reopening of bars, EABL announced a Sh532 million ($5 million) recovery fund to help pubs and bars resume trade post-lockdown.The two-year plan dubbed “Raising the Bar” was part of the Sh10.6 billion ($100 million) kitty rolled out from June 1 in different markets through EABL’s parent firm, Diageo.EABL made the recovery plan to offer targeted support like purchasing equipment such as hygiene kits, permanent sanitiser dispenser units, hand sanitisers, masks, and protection screens for bars that cannot maintain the one-metre social distance.The firm offered the bars hardware and not cash through the recovery plan that comes in form of a free grant.In November, the State gazette rules that required bars to hire Covid-19 liaison officers to ensure that drinkers observe protocols meant to curb the spread of the disease in the facilities upon a looming second wave.Bars committed to cut sitting capacity by half under social distance rules, have contact free-bill payment, restrict drinking at the counters as the industry turned to self-regulation due to a lack of regulations from the State.They were also required to close dance floors and reduce contact between staff and drinkers, designate spacious waiting and collection areas for couriers and customers as part of curbing the spread of the coronavirus.Alcohol Beverages Association of Kenya, a lobby group for alcohol manufacturers and importers had in its petition raised concerns about unsafe socialising behaviour by some establishments operating with little regard to the Covid-19 guidelines.Some entertainment spots are still yet to open months later such as Mojos in the Nairobi CBD and Lounge 108 in Gachie."

The time is now. Nairobi must be liberated. Viva!"" he said via a video shared across social media.""The cartels and their surrogates are trembling already, but the majestic people of Nairobi are happy and ready with their voters' cards. We are going to transform Nairobi into a first-class county and city.""This comes a week after Miguna had on December 19 announced his interest to run for Nairobi governor's seat moments after the IEBC set the date for the by-election.Thirdway Alliance national chairman Miruru Waweru said Miguna is the best bet to reclaim the capital city from what he described as ineptitude.Waweru said the forthcoming by-election offers Nairobi residents an opportunity to correct 'one of the greatest political mistakes of our generation.'“Nairobi deserves leadership devoid of ineptitude, unbridled lust and gluttony for public resources which has defined it for the last eight years,” said Waweru.Waweru said Miguna is the right choice because he has consistently fought for including integrity, visionary and transformative leadership, elimination of corruption and development for all.Thirdway Alliance appealed to state agencies including the electoral commission to respect previous court rulings that affirmed Miguna's Kenyan citizenship."
739,Biden: Trump aides setting 'roadblocks' for his transition team,"President-elect Joe Biden said on Monday many of America's security agencies had been ""hollowed out"" under President Donald Trump and the lack of information being provided to his transition team by the outgoing administration was an ""irresponsibility.""""We've encountered roadblocks from the political leadership at the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget,"" Biden said after a meeting with his foreign policy team.""Right now we just aren't getting all of the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas. It's nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility,"" he added.After Biden beat Trump in the November 3 election, the Democrat’s team only began meeting with administration officials in late November to coordinate the handover.Trump, a Republican, has refused to concede defeat and his administration only authorized cooperation with Biden on November 23. Biden takes office on January 20.Earlier this month, Biden's team said they had met resistance to requests for information from some Pentagon officials.The Pentagon pushed back.In a statement, acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller said the Pentagon had conducted 164 interviews with over 400 officials and provided more than 5,000 pages of documents.""Our (Department of Defense) political and career officials have been working with the utmost professionalism to support transition activities in a compressed time schedule and they will continue to do so in a transparent and collegial manner that upholds the finest traditions of the department,"" Miller said.But Biden reiterated his team's concerns on Monday. When he takes office, he will inherit a wide range of foreign policy and national security challenges, including China, Iran and North Korea, as well as the coronavirus pandemic raging across the globe.One of his toughest tasks will be rebuilding US alliances that have frayed under four years of Trump's ""America First"" agenda.""My team needs a clear picture of our force posture around the world and our operations to deter our enemies,"" Biden said.

740,South Africa announces new restrictions as virus cases surpass 1 million mark,"President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced new tougher coronavirus restrictions, a day after South Africa recorded more than one million Covid-19 cases.Indoor and outdoor gatherings will be banned, a curfew introduced from 9 pm to 6 pm, and alcohol sales prohibited.Mr Ramaphosa said the country was at an extremely dangerous point in the pandemic and action had to be taken.Recently authorities confirmed a new, faster-spreading variant of the virus had been detected in South Africa.Some hospitals and medical centres have reported a huge rise in admissions, putting a heavy strain on resources.In a televised speech, Mr Ramaphosa said the new 501.V2 variant was now well established in South Africa, and the recent rise in cases was a ""cause for great alarm"".""We have simply let our guard down,"" said the president.He added that the new measures would come into effect at midnight on Monday (22:00 GMT) and last at least until 15 January.He said gatherings except for funerals and a few other limited exceptions would be banned, no-one would be able to leave their homes between 21:00 and 6:00 without a permit, and all shops, bars and other venues would have to close by 20:00.All alcohol sales would also be banned, and every individual who failed to wear a mask in public places would face possible fines or imprisonment, he added.On Sunday South Africa became the first country in Africa to pass a million Covid-19 cases, with 1,004,413 infections and 26,735 deaths since the outbreak began in March.Last week, it recorded a daily average of 11,700 new infections - a rise of 39% on the previous week - and from Wednesday to Friday, the daily number of new cases was above 14,000.The 501.V2 variant is believed to be driving the surge in infections. It was identified by a network of South African scientists in the Eastern Cape province and then rapidly spread to other parts of the country.Earlier this week, the UK banned travel from South Africa because of the new variant. Another new Covid variant has already been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately.Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells, but appear unrelated to each other.After South Africa, the worst hit country on the African continent is Morocco, which has seen 432,079 cases and 7,240 deaths. They are followed by Egypt with 132,541 cases and 7,405 deaths and Tunisia with 131,592 infections and 4,466 deaths."
741,Ex-MP Mwinga to be buried in Kaloleni on January 9,"The body of former Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga has been transferred from the Mombasa Hospital morgue to the Pandya Memorial Hospital morgue where it will stay until around January 8.The body will then be buried on January 9 at his rural home at Chamagande in Kaloleni sub-county, according to the Burial Committee chair Philip Ziro.Kaloleni MP Paul Katana, who was charged with ensuring the safe transfer of the body from Mombasa Hospital mortuary to the Pandya Memorial Hospital mortuary said Kaloleni has lost a father figure and a development-oriented leader.“He will be remembered most for his love for his people and for championing for the unity of the Coast region,” said Katana.The MP asked the public to respect the wishes of the bereaved family and allow them to mourn in peace.“There are all kinds of speculation regarding Mwinga’s death. The family has not released any official statement on the death, so let people not come up with imaginations, rumours and falsehoods,” said Katana at Mombasa Hospital.Katana and the late Mwinga’s uncle and personal assistant, Ngunza Kahindi, had to talk to the hundreds of mourners who had gathered at the Pandya Memorial Hospital to view the late legislators’ body, in order to calm them down after it emerged that they would not be allowed to view it.Ziro explained that he had been informed by the mortuary attendants at Pandya Memorial Hospital said the body had to be treated first before mourners are allowed to view it.Although disappointed, the mourners, who had gathered at the hospital from as early as 1 pm, said they understood.Mwinga’s widow Brenda Nanjala was overwhelmed with emotions as she witnessed her late husband’s body being transferred into the Pandya morgue.She had to be held by relatives.Mwinga had been admitted at the Mombasa Hospital since at least December 20.Umoja Summit Party of Kenya Kilifi county chair Birya Menza, who was a close friend to Mwinga, said the late legislator had informed him of his sickness on December 20.“I called him to inform him I was at a burial in Mwandaza in Kaloleni ward. I had expected to see him there,"" said Menza.“However, he told me he could not make it to the burial because he had been admitted at Mombasa Hospital and was suffering from severe bacterial infections.”On Monday, December 21, Mwinga informed Menza his condition has gotten worse prompting the USPK chairman to want to visit him in hospital.“However, he told me not to waste my fare because where he is, doctors would not allow me to see him,” said Menza.The Kilifi county USPK said he sent him a text on Christmas eve wishing him a Merry Christmas but Mwinga never responded.He did not pick Menza’s calls too.On Christmas day, Menza again sent him a text message wishing him a Merry Christmas but Mwinga neither responded nor picked the follow-up calls.“Then on Boxing Day, I got the sad news that my friend and advisor is no more,” said Menza.He described Mwinga as a personal advisor and mentor.“He had promised to organize a political meeting for me in January in Kaloleni so I could sell the unity agenda of the USPK to Kaloleni residents,” said Menza.Mwinga had been supportive of the USPK because of their unity agenda.USPK secretary-general Naomi Cidi said they had worked with Mwinga side by side in pushing the Coast agenda although the late legislator had formed his own Devolution Party of Kenya.There were talks ongoing between Mwinga and the USPK leadership to try and work out a possible merger of the parties.“He was planning to join hands with USPK. When we wanted to join all Coast parties he was among the champions of the idea. He was very influential in most of the meetings we had,” said Cidi.Mwinga has left behind a widow and three children."

The government will not be in a position to provide masks to each learner. Parents have to get into their pockets and at least provide two reusable masks for their learners. This should not be a hard thing to do,” he said.Unicef is installing hand washing facilities in over 600 schools in line with the government’s back to school directive for learning institutions.Since September, Unicef has worked with the government on guidelines for schools and is continuing to distribute soap and install hand-washing facilities in a number of schools.The agency will also be supporting the Ministry of Education with a ‘Back to School’ campaign, that aims at ensuring all children, including those who had dropped out, return to schools safely when they reopen."

748,Voter moves to court to stop Nairobi gubernatorial by-election,"A Nairobi voter has moved to court in an attempt to stop the upcoming gubernatorial by-elections because of the Coronavirus pandemic.In an application to court, Josphat Ngendo wants the court to stop IEBC from conducting the by-elections to replace Mike Sonko as governor.He also wants to be enjoined in the case that was filed in court challenging the nomination of Anne Mwenda as the Deputy Governor.Mwenda was nominated by impeached Governor Mike Sonko early this year but the court barred the assembly from vetting her.“Pending hearing of the petition, court be pleased to grant a stay of the Gazette Notice dated December 21 issued by IEBC calling for the by-election in respect to Nairobi County to be held on February 18 2021,” reads court papers.Ngendo further wants the court to set aside the orders issued barring the vetting of Mwenda as the deputy governor of the County.He wants the court to determine whether Mwenda was validly nominated as deputy Governor by Sonko.“In light of the impeachment of the Governor the prevailing circumstances brought about by Covid-19 pandemic, it’s in the public interest that this court determines the question of whether Mwenda was validly nominated by Sonko,” Ngendo argues.He also claims that unless the court stops the by-election it will result in great prejudice to him, the people of Nairobi and Mwenda.It’s his argument that if the elections pull through as expected then it will further expose people to the coronavirus.“The same will avert a catastrophic crisis in the informal sector during the campaign period for the position of the office of the Governor and further save on public funds,” he says.""Ngendo and other millions of Nairobi residents have been adversely affected by the pandemic and their sources of livelihood completely decimated by the pandemic.""In February this year, Justice Mumbi Ngugi issued orders that prohibited the vetting of Mwenda until the application filed by one Peter Odhiambo Agoro is heard and determined.However, Mwenda challenged the orders and asked for a review seeking the court to set them aside arguing that there was a timeline in which to appoint a DG.Justice Mumbi Ngugi dismissed the application saying she was not satisfied there is a basis for review of the orders she issued."
749,2020: The year that saw peaks and troughs in the Nairobi County Assembly,"Referred to the ‘House of Drama’, chaos and wrangles at the Nairobi County Assembly had become a tendency witnessed by the public.In-house power battles and administrative issues seemed to be at the centre of the chaos witnessed in the assembly.The chaos had not only marked with a bitter exchange of words among the legislators and broken furniture but had also been accompanied by teargas lobbed by police officers.This year’s climax of drama was witnessed on July 28, 2020, when a section of MCAs had attempted to serve former county assembly speaker Beatrice Elachi with an impeachment notice.The chaos witnessed saw Mlango Kubwa MCA Patriciah Mutheu spend the night at Nairobi Women's Hospital after police officers clobbered her at the assembly.Elachi’s resignation The drama soon culminated in the unexpected resignation of Beatrice Elachi as the Speaker of the County Assembly.Her resignation on August 11, 2020, came at a time when she was in a protracted power battle with MCAs and had fallen off with the then Governor Mike Sonko over the supplementary bill that had allocated Sh15 billion to the Nairobi Metropolitan Service.She also cited threats to her life and family also as part of the reasons for her resignation.While tendering her resignation via a televised address Elachi said her resignation due to ‘ life-threatening incident’ that made her work untenable at the County Assembly.Elachi, the first female speaker of Nairobi County Assembly had time to time found herself at loggerheads with a section of MCAs who even impeached her on September 6, 2017.Despite her ouster, the court reinstated Elachi but she still kept away from the assembly only make a comeback on October 9, 2019, that was accompanied by teargas and chaos.However, with the support of Governor Sonko and the Jubilee Party, Elachi managed to stay in office until August this year.Change of leadershipPower battles have always been at the centre of wrangles in the assembly.This year, we saw the comeback of former councillors becoming part of the Jubilee leadership of the county assembly Changes in the leadership of the Jubilee Party have always had been rocked with back and forth resistance and it took Secretary-General Raphel Tuju to communicate leadership changes three times following Elachi’s resistance to acknowledge the leadership.Matopeni Ward rep Abdi Ibrahim Hassan alias Guyo proved his supremacy in 2020 by reclaiming back his Majority leader seat after being kicked out following Elachi’s comeback in October 2019.His comeback saw Mihang’o MCA Paul Kados gain the Majority Whip position with his deputy Waithera Chege and Deputy Majority Leader Peter Wanyoike.Guyo’s leadership saw this team kicked out of power and Dandora Area 3 MCA Charles Thuo losing the Majority leader’s seat he had attained in November 2019, Nominated MCA June Ndegwa lost the Majority Whip position and, Ziwani MCA Millicent Mugadi the Deputy Majority leader.On the minority side, ‘Embakasi MCA Michael Ogada was placed by ODM Party as the Minority leader in August, kicking out Karen MCA David Mberia from the position.Hospital MCA’s Patrick Musili lost the deputy majority leader position to nominated MCA Mellab Atema while her counterpart Catherine Okoth was placed as ODM party’s representative to the County Assembly’s board, kicking out Nairobi West MCA Maurice Gari.Former Mayor and Baba Dogo MCA Geoffery Majiwa was also elected as the Deputy Speaker.Ngwele’s exitThis year also marked the end of an era of Jacob Ngwele who had been serving as the County Assembly Clerk since 2013.The rain started beating Ngwele after former Speaker Elachi made a comeback on October 9, 2020, and a month later he was kicked out of the assembly after a report was adopted to revoke his appointment.Despite the court ‘saving’ him and recognizing him as the substantive clerk, Ngwele never accessed the assembly since November 2019.After eight months, on July 23, 2020, Ngwele returned to clerk’s office after a court and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission ( EACC) affirmed he was in office legally.However, he was finally ousted from the office after the Labour and Employment Court in October ruled that his appointment to the office was shrouded by irregularities.Parties crack the whip on MCAs This year, Both Jubilee and ODM Party showed their interests in maintaining party discipline and position on matters as they moved in to tow the line of MCAs.Amidst Sonko's impeachment and budget stalemate, Jubilee Party suspended three Sonko allied Nominated MCAs; Silvia Museiya, Millicent Jagero and Ann Thumbi from the party for six months.They were also dewhipped for six from all the committees on the assembly.On December 3, 2020, as MCAs impeached their Governor, ODM Party suspended 12 of its MCAs for a period of three to six months as well as dewhipped from committees.The 12 MCAs ( both Nominated and Elected ) were also fined a total of Sh9.25 million over misconduct after disciplinary hearings The elected MCAs included David Okello (Huruma), Redson Otieno (Ngei), Jared Okode (Mathare North) and David Mbithi (Viwandani), Wilson Ocholla ( Utalii), Maurice Gari ( Nairobi West), Nicholas Okumu ( Lower Savannah) and Cecili Ayot ( Laini Saba).The Nominated MCAs were Caroline Mayunzu, Millicent Akinyi, Hafsa Khalif and Nimo Haji.New Speaker and Acting GovernorThe year 2020 has been filled with events that will go down Nairobi’s history lane.For one 48-year-old Benson Mutura (Former Makadara MP and Councilor), 2020 was a year full unexpected events.Not being a new face in the Nairobi political arena, Mutura made a comeback at City Hall on August 14, 2020, after being elected as the third speaker of the county assembly.This was after Elachi resignation from the seat.Mutura was President Uhuru Kenyatta's fronted candidate and was voted by both Jubilee and ODM MCAs.With the turn of events, within a span of four months, Mutura was made one of the most powerful figures in Nairobi.Mutura was last week sworn in as Acting Governor of Nairobi County following Sonko's impeachment on December 17, 2020.By this Nairobi becomes the first County to invoke the provisions of Article 182(5) of the Constitution following the vacancy that arose in the Office of the Governor of Nairobi City.Mutura will act in the position until February 2021 when Nairobi’s gubernatorial by-elections will be held."
750,Reached Form Four? Your risk of getting diabetes is higher,"The more educated you are, the higher your risk of diabetes, regardless of whether you are overweight or obese.A new analysis shows a 14 per cent increase in the risk of diabetes for Kenyans with secondary school education or higher compared with those with no formal education.Researchers say this specific risk has nothing to do with being overweight or obese, the two main major drivers of the growing diabetes epidemic.They said even after taking away the two factors during the analysis, the association between education levels and diabetes remained statistically significant.“In contrast to the association seen in high-income countries, diabetes risk was highest among those with greater educational attainment, independent of BMI,” the researchers said in the study published recently in the Diabetes Care journal, owned by the American  Association of Diabetes.The study is a meta-analysis of the World Health Organisation STEP wise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) survey from 29 countries including Kenya, from 2008 to 2016.The STEPS survey collects and disseminates data about noncommunicable disease risk factors in adults living in WHO member countries.The researchers explained that more educated people may have poor diet quality and physical inactivity, which are also independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes.The relationship may also be explained by the recently proposed obesity transition theory, where unhealthy lifestyle behaviours are first adopted by more affluent groups.“As public knowledge of disease prevention and access to preventive services increase, social norms change, and the rise of obesity and diabetes in affluent groups is attenuated and the burden shifts to vulnerable segments of the population,” the study says.The authors also explained the results using the fifth stages of the nutritional transition theory.The stages progress from hunter-gatherer level to industrialized societies with low levels of physical activity and high consumption of energy-dense foods, resulting in the rise of obesity and diabetes (stage 4).The fifth stage occurs in countries with higher economic growth such as the US, where well-off people adopt an individual behavioural change to reduce sedentary behaviour and adopt healthier eating habits.“Lower middle-income countries included in this analysis may be at an advanced stage in the nutrition transition but with no reversal in the socioeconomic gradient of diabetes risk,” they said."
751,"Sifuna, Jumwa off the hook over Msambweni exchanges","ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna and Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa have been let off the hook over their bitter and vulgar exchanges during Msambweni by-election campaigns.The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has said it won’t press charges against the two. This comes after they publicly apologised for their remarks.“For us, we won’t pursue anything beyond what we have done,” NCIC commissioner Danvas Makori said.The commissioners said the fact that the two politicians acknowledged their wrongdoing and publicly issued an apology are a testament to their regrets and willingness to reconcile.“Those words have effect on the ground in terms of supporters. They have potential of inciting people on the ground. So, if they take them words back, then that is enough to heal,” he said.""Our act gives us powers to do that. If somebody acknowledges in public, then we stop at that because that acknowledgement is enough to heal.”Sifuna and Jumwa were grilled by the commission last week during which they publicly apologised.Sifuna had offered to do 50 hours of community service to show remorse and demonstrate his regret.“As a lawyer, I am offering 50 hours of free legal service in any case touching on gender-based violence, particularly in Msambweni. This will demonstrate genuine remorse so that we can put the chapter behind us,” he said.The following day, Jumwa also apologised and promised to restrain herself.“People did not know what triggered my utterances, but I apologise to the country and in particular the girl child,” she said.Jumwa further said she had forgiven Sifuna for remarks he made targeting her.Makori said the NCIC Act allows them to use alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to reconcile parties.“It is the preferred way of resolving conflicts. Being taken to court won’t cure anything. We think that ADR, conciliation and mediation are the key,” Makori said.Section 51 of the NCIC Act gives the commission the mandate to reconcile warring parties."
752,Ruto has panicked over crumbling political camp — Mudavadi's spokesman,"ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi's spokesman Kabisu Kabatesi has hit out at DP William Ruto for his attempts to undermine political bigwigs from Western.Kabatesi blasted Ruto for his political overtures to have Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula enter into a pre-2022 political marriage with him.He said at no time have Mudavadi and Wetang'ula lacked political partners to work with for them to seek company of a person ""whose character is wanting”.“The two welcome political partnerships underpinned by integrity,” Kabatesi said in a blistering attack on the DP.Ruto has sustained calls for the two leaders to work with him ahead of the next general election in the wake of a bitter falling-out with President Uhuru Kenyatta.Ruto on Saturday chided the two leaders over what he termed a tendency to snub him despite his many 'calls' to have them strike a political deal.“I always call them. At least tell them to pick up my phone calls. Maybe they fear my calls because they think I want to ask for their votes,"" Ruto said.He spoke during the burial of Maurice Mabonga Wanjala, the father of Bumula MP Moses Mabonga.But Kabatesi said before Ruto can even reach out to Mudavadi and Wetang'ula, he should first exorcise his demons in Jubilee Party.“He must face the truth that he is part of the mess the Jubilee government has brought on Kenyans. He cannot wriggle out by pretending to be impoverished Kenyans’ Robin Hood,” Kabatesi said.He said Ruto’s attempt to appropriate and personalise government projects like he did demonstrates a devious character and desperation to cling on any straw to survive the political onslaught he faces. Kabatesi said Ruto has panicked because of the two Western leaders' unity and efforts to bring together the Luhya nation. He termed it ridiculous for a man who has been claiming of massive support in Western to seek a forced marriage with Mudavadi and Wetang'ula.“If Ruto is so sure of support from Western people, it makes little sense for him to seek a forced marriage with Mudavadi and Wetang'ula. His bravado hides a worried and panicking man,” Kabatesi said.He said the DP plays politics of deceit and buying political support using money whose sources are suspect.“He (Ruto) covets and is infatuated by hubris. It is hubris that drives him to undermine his own government and oppose his boss, the President,” Kabatesi said.He said Ruto's arrogance blinds him to go to the backyard of Western leaders and issue an ultimatum.“Ruto is showing all the signs that give meaning to the adage that ‘pride comes before a fall.'""The two leaders aren’t ready to offer Ruto a shoulder to cry on; not until he reforms his waywardness and makes peace with his partners in Jubilee. He cannot be demanding partnership when his house is burning,” he said."
753,"Uhuru, Raila and Ruto condole with Mudavadi family","President Uhuru Kenyatta has eulogised Mama Hannah Atsianzale Mudavadi as a true family matriarch that brought up a close-knit family.Hannah, the mother of ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, died on Monday at the Nairobi Hospital aged 92.In his message of condolence and comfort to the Mudavadi family, Uhuru said Hannah was generous and helped many poor Kenyans access education.“Mama Hannah was the cornerstone of the Mudavadi family, a wise woman of few words on whose broad shoulders many people were raised to become great Kenyans.""Mrs Mudavadi was a gracious and loving mother, a true matriarch who loved and took care of all people, especially those in need, without any reservation,"" the President said.Hannah was the widow of Cabinet Minister Moses Mudamba Mudavadi.Uhuru described her as a devoted, generous and humble matriarch who raised a close-knit family and contributed immensely to the progress of her community.He said she will especially be remembered for her love for education and how she assisted many bright children from poor families access quality education. Uhuru wished Mudavadi and his family God's solace as they come to terms with her demise.“We will forever be grateful for her charitable work and acts of love.

Deep condolences to my friend Musalia Mudavadi and his family. The pillar may be gone, but you must soldier on. My prayers are with you,"" he said."
754,Political bigwigs to watch in 2021,"President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto top the list of political bigwigs to watch in 2021, a time the country is expected to hold the first constitutional amendments to the current law.Known for dwindling political bromance since they were re-elected to office in 2017, Uhuru and Ruto will play a critical role, especially in the coming amendments whereas the President has expressed his support for the law change while his deputy has remained non-committal.Political commentator Danstan Omari insists that President Uhuru remains a person to watch in the coming two years stating he will shape a number of political happenings both next year and 2022.“Unlike Kibaki's time, Uhuru has engaged very actively in the elections of 2022 so Kenyans must watch his steps as he has fought not to be a lame-duck president and he seems to be succeeding. So, he'll be a big question in 2022,” Omari said.“Then we have now the contestants, William Ruto with his hustler movement and Raila Odinga if he will contest. They have a big following, fanatical bases, they are serious politicians, good campaigners and the deep rich docket so they'll also be very critical in 2022.”Smarting from gruesome Msambweni by-elections and losing the seat to his arch political rival Deputy President William Ruto, opposition chief remains a man whose commission and omission will thrust him among the marked men of 2021.The coming referendum and series of by-elections in Nairobi, Matungu and Kabuchai will put the trio in the national political scene as they are expected to stamp their political authorities ahead of 2022.Nairobi being dear to President’s heart, some sources are saying that Uhuru and Raila could sponsor joint candidates for governor and deputy governor in a strategy to control Nairobi politics ahead of 2022 polls.The President is also keen on a loyal governor who will not disrupt the workings of the Nairobi Metropolitan Services and threaten the deed of transfer.Political Analyst Joseph Mutua, however, opines that in the coming year, Raila and ANC boss will be people to watch especially from President Uhuru’s camp.He noted that Raila would find it easy to sacrifice his presidential ambition and support Mudavadi so as to block Ruto from taking over from President Uhuru in 2022.“We are going to have two camps, one of them being the handshake and the Ruto camp. The politicians to watch in the handshake or BBI camp are quite a number but talking about the front liners, I have two in mind - Musalia Mudavadi and Raila Odinga as the presidential candidate in the handshake camp,” Mutua said.He added: “The reason why I'm talking about the two is that the position of Raila is that he doesn't want Ruto to succeed President Kenyatta and  he has made up his mind that he does not want Ruto to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022 and based on that if Raila realizes that he is not commanding the full support of the country he may opt to step aside and support Musalia Mudavadi as the presidential candidate on the handshake coalition.”Mutua also avers that eyes should also be on ex Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, two leaders he noted will play conspicuous roles in the handshake team going into 2022.Already, Kenneth’s name has popped up as a likely successor to impeached governor Mike Sonko.A former Nairobi gubernatorial aspirant and once Planning assistant minister and a 2013 presidential candidate, Kenneth is also viewed as the heir apparent of President Uhuru in Mt. Kenya politics.According to Omari, a new breed of politicians especially Governors serving their final terms will also hold sway on the politics of next year going into 2022.“These are the new entrance. We have Oparanya (Kakamega Governor), Joho (Mombasa Governor), Mudavadi, Kalonzo. All these people are likely to be determinants for the 50 plus one vote. They might deny some people the requisite 50 plus one vote,” Omari said.Veteran trade unionist and Cotu Secretary General Francis is another individual who political observers see as another force to reckon with in the New Year.Atwoli’s Ildamat home is known for hosting who-is-who in the political arena where political deals are discussed and settled.A confessed KANU loyalist, Atwoli’s passion for Building Bridges Initiative and 2022 succession politics has earned him ‘membership’ to the politically correct elites loosely referred to as Deep State of Uhuru’s administration.Observers, however, note that Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetangula’s relevance will be informed by the bold steps they will take especially on their 2022 political matrix."

756,EU starts mass vaccination in 'touching moment of unity',"The EU is launching a co-ordinated vaccine rollout to fight Covid-19, in what the bloc's top official says is a ""touching moment of unity"".European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had been delivered to all 27 member states.Some countries started administering the jabs on Saturday, saying they were not prepared to wait another day.The EU has so far reported more than 335,000 Covid-related deaths.More than 14 million people have been infected, and strict lockdown measures are currently in place in nearly all the member states.The vaccine rollout comes as cases of the more contagious variant of Covid-19 are confirmed in several European nations as well as Canada and Japan.News of the new variant triggered travel restrictions around the world last week.What's the latest on the vaccine rollout?Mass vaccination across the EU - a bloc of 446 million people - began early on Sunday.This comes after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Commission authorised the German-US Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.The EU has secured contracts for more than two billion vaccine doses from a range of drug companies.""Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year. The #COVID19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries. Vaccination will begin tomorrow across the EU,"" Ms von der Leyen tweeted on Saturday.""The #EUvaccinationdays are a touching moment of unity. Vaccination is the lasting way out of the pandemic,"" she added.The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Saturday: ""This really is a happy Christmas message. At this moment, lorries with the first vaccines are on the road all over Europe, all over Germany, in all federal states. Further deliveries will follow the day after tomorrow.""This vaccine is the crucial key for defeating the pandemic. It's the key for us getting back our lives.""Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio urged his compatriots to get the jabs. ""We'll get our freedom back, we'll be able to embrace again,"" he said.Health workers in north-east Germany decided not to wait for Sunday and started immunising elderly residents of a nursing home in Halberstadt.In Hungary, the first recipient of the vaccine was a doctor at Del-Pest Central Hospital on Saturday, the state news agency says.The authorities in Slovakia also said they had begun vaccinating."
757,Year virus put protection of iconic species at risk,"The Covid-19 pandemic took the world by storm and hit the tourism industry hardest.The sector took a nosedive after international travel was stopped as one way of curbing the spread of the virus.In April, the Kenya Wildlife Service announced a tiger had been infected with the coronavirus.It announced precautionary measures for captive wildlife facilities.This was after the United State Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed SARS-Cov-2 in one of the tigers at a zoo in New York on April 5.The samples from the tiger were taken and tested after several lions and tigers at the zoo showed symptoms of respiratory illness.It is believed that the big cats became sick after getting exposed to a zoo employee who was actively shedding the virus.On March 30, pre-print of a scientific publication titled 'Susceptibility of ferrets, cats, dogs and different domestic animals to SARS-coronavirus-2' made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 international licence, reported an investigation of susceptibility of ferrets and animals in close contact with humans to SARS-Cov-2.Though it had not undergone peer review, the authors found that SARS-Cov-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens and ducks.It, however, replicates in ferrets and cats.They also found out that the virus is transmitted in cats through respiratory droplets.KWS said although the study is experimental, whereby the virus was inoculated into the animals, there is the possibility of the same occurring in a natural setting, especially in their captive facilities where human-animal interaction is high.KWS director general John Waweru called for precaution.""To ensure that susceptible animals in captive facilities are not exposed to this virus, it is important to identify specific staff who will work with various families of animals species in the captive facilities. For example, specific staff be deployed to work with felids, canids, herbivores and non-human primates,"" he said.In June Tourism CS Najib Balala announced that the country had lost 50 per cent of total annual tourism earnings.This translates to Sh81.8 billion based on last last year's revenues when the sector generated Sh163.6 billion.The CS said the pandemic, which was declared a global pandemic in March, had hit the sector hard, bringing international travel and tourism to a halt.""We began the first and second quarters of financial year 2019-20 with tremendous tourism growth. However, the performance was curtailed by the coronavirus,"" Balala said.Data from the government, in collaboration with the Kenya Private Sector Alliance, indicates travel and tourism is the most hit, with 3.1 million jobs affected.This includes hotel employees, pubs and restaurants, tour operators, airlines, travel agents and their related suppliers and support services.The impact of the pandemic also affected the operations and programmes in some of the protected areas.These included operations such as protecting endangered species, conducting regular field patrols, managing human-wildlife conflicts, monitoring illegal wildlife trade, conducting anti-poaching operations and generating revenue from various sources.A study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature World Commission on Protected Areas showed that most countries reported high impacts in activities related to monitoring illegal wildlife trade, gathering security intelligence and carrying out security investigations.African Wildlife Foundation supported the survey.“The impact of the pandemic on revenue generation was so serious that nearly half of protected areas across Africa reported that they could only maintain basic operations for up to three months if the restrictions imposed by Covid-19 continued to be in force,” part of the study released June said.""This loss of income to already underfunded protected areas has huge implications on their ability to perform basic functions and fulfill mandatory obligations, including payment of salaries and protecting biodiversity and other resources.""It is estimated that there were 1.5 billion tourists in the world. Of these, Africa received 71.2 million and Kenya 2.05 million.The report was commissioned by the National Tourism Crisis Committee under the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife in June.“The airline sector of the tourism industry is adversely affected. There is a ban on international  travel worldwide, including Kenya. The Covid-19 outbreak could cause 50 million job loses; which may translate to a global loss in tourism revenue of about USD30 to USD50 billion in 2020,” the report reads.Kenya has recorded impressive growth in the tourism sector since 2015. Tourism arrivals grew by 3.9 per cent from 2.02 million tourists in 2018 to 2.05 million tourists in 2019 after a 37.33 per cent from 1.47 million in 2017.Domestic tourism numbers grew from 3,645,144 in 2017 to 3,974,243 in 2018, recording a 9.03 per cent growth.Wildlife conservancies have also not been spared, with most now relying on donations.Landowners within the Maasai Mara, despite leasing their large tracts of land, have nothing to show for it.However, Conservation International has come to their rescue, promising to provide a lifeline for them.Conservation International announced that it will provide a loan programme to support conservancies imperilled by drop in tourism.Maasai Mara is home to 25 per cent of Kenya’s wildlife and host the greatest annual migration of animals on Earth. The greater Mara ecosystem is one of the most important conservation areas in Africa.The land is owned by the indigenous Maasai people, who lease it to conservancies for tourism operations, which in turn fund conservation efforts that drive wildlife tourism.But this conservation model, one of the most promising and innovative in Africa, faces collapse as a result of the pandemic.The loss of lease income due to the halt in tourism — and uncertainty as to when tourists may return —could force the Maasai landowners to sell or convert their land to farming, putting wildlife conservation at risk.In 2019, Maasai landowners collected more than $7.5 million (Sh815.8 million) in lease payments; this year they are expecting less than half that sum.Working with the Maasai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association, Conservation International has established the Maasai Mara Rescue Fund, a loan programme that will help cover lease payments owed by the conservancies to landowners.The fund will provide a significant boost to the donations made by other landscape supporters.“The fallout in tourism due to the pandemic means communities are struggling to survive. These lease payments will help ensure the lands that make up the greater Maasai Mara remain wild, and that the communities that count on income from tourism are supported during this global crisis,” said Michael O’Brien-Onyeka, senior vice president of the Africa Field Division at Conservation International.Daniel ole Sopia, CEO of the Maasai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association, said over the last two decades, local communities and tourism investors have worked to find a way that nature and people can thrive together.“Our conservancies both secure critical wildlife populations and benefit local people. This is what successful conservation looks like,” he said.Sopia said Covid-19 has put this model at risk.“This innovative fund will help us withstand this shock, and better prepare for future ones. It will help us, our hard work, survive,"" he said.As home to some of Africa’s most iconic animals – elephants, lions, leopards, buffalo and rhino – the Maasai Mara’s sweeping rangelands are one of the world’s last remaining places where all of these animals roam.The Great Migration, which takes place from July to October, occurred this year with a fraction of the tourists who typically turn out to see it — resulting in significantly less income for the conservancies and ultimately less resources for conservation.Through the loan programme, conservancies across the Maasai Mara will secure short-to-medium term funding to offset the revenue loss from Covid-19 and support long-term sustainability.The loans will be repaid out of future tourism returns and fees that the conservancies collect from tourism operators.As a condition of the loan, the conservancies will be required to implement governance, operational and financial strengthening activities to ensure long-term sustainability of the conservancy model.The ecosystem spans 4,500 square kilometers.The Maasai community controls more than one-third of the ecosystem through community conservancies with the conservancies supporting the livelihoods of an estimated 100,000 people."
758,"144 killed by police in 2020, say human rights lobbies","More than 700 people have died in the hands of the police since 2007, reports by human rights lobbies documenting extrajudicial killings show.A data base maintained by Missing Voices, a website mounted by human rights entities including Kenya Human Rights Commission and International Justice Mission to document case of extrajudicial killings, show 2020 has been the second deadliest after 2007. Some 144 have been killed by security officers in 2020 according to Missing Voices.It ranks far higher that 2019 when 144 people got killed by the police. Cumulatively, 742 people have been killed or disappeared without a trace, acts attributable to police conduct, the website shows.Direct police shooting accounted for 59 per cent of the deaths. Battering, torture and teargassing accounted for the other deaths.The onset of the coronavirus pandemic with the attendant containment measures enforced by the police saw many of such deaths. The measures included curfews, partial lockdowns of Nairobi and the three Coastal counties of Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale.For example, as of June 15 people had died at the hands of the police as they enforced the dust-to-dawn curfew. Police watchdog the Independent Policing Oversight Authority said in a statement in June that it had received 87 complaints against police since they started enforcing the curfew and heightened security measures.The complaints included deaths, shootings, harassment, assaults, robbery, inhuman treatment and sexual assault, the authority said.“After preliminary investigations, 15 deaths and 31 incidents where victims sustained injuries have directly been linked to actions of police officers during the curfew enforcement,” Ipoa said in a statement.Police Spokesman Charles Owino maintains the police did nothing wrong and that any mistakes attributable to them were due to common human error. Police officers do their job under very tough circumstances and we only owe them our thanks, he said. The wrong ones are held personally responsible, Owino added.Yassin Hussein Moyo, 13, is part of the statistics. He was shot by police on March 31, only 4 days after the police commenced the curfew enforcement operation.He was playing in his parent’s balcony in Mathare area. Reports at the time indicated that the police officer Dancun Ndiema had shot in the air to scare people into their homes as he enforced the curfew.Moyo’s mother Khadija Abdullahi Hussein told the media that after she heard the shot, she told her children to lie down shortly before Moyo complained of being hit by the bullet in the stomach.“After a few minutes I heard gunshots, I told the kids to lie down. I noticed that Yasin had fallen off the chair where he was standing.”In a fainting voice, Moyo would tell her; “Mama I've been shot.”Police officer Ndiema was later arraigned and charged with murder. He denied the charges.Dennis Lusava is the latest victim. He was arrested by police in October allegedly for not wearing a mask. His decomposing body would be found at the bank of river Nzoia a few days later. Post-mortem conducted by state pathologist Dickson Muchana found that the 31-year-old was tortured using blunt objects.“The deceased was tortured to death. There were no indications that he drowned in the river. He was assaulted with a blunt object, resulting in severe injuries on his neck, forehead, occipital area, backbone and the left upper quadrant,” Muchana said in a report.EnragedAll accusing fingers have been trained towards police officers who are said to have bludgeoned him to death while he was detained at Mbururu police station in Lugari constituency.Enraged locals set the police station on fire.The multiple reports and optics of police violence in enforcing the curfew, the public anger was palpable, with public demonstrations organised. Human rights groups such as Amnesty International, ICJ and Human Rights Watch roundly condemned the alleged conduct of the police.“The police, without apparent justification, shot and beat people at markets or returning home from work, even before the start of the curfew. Police have also broken into homes and shops, extorted money from residents or looted food in locations across the country,” Human Rights Watch said in its April 22 report.“It is shocking that people are losing their lives and livelihoods while supposedly being protected from infection,” Otsieno Namwaya, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch said. “Police brutality isn’t just unlawful; it is also counterproductive in fighting the spread of the virus,” he added.The general public anger culminated in a public protest in Nairobi organised by civil society groups demanding that culpable officers be held accountable.Robina Otieno, a grassroot activist in Mathare said the police’s aggressiveness exposed more people to the virus yet their action was meant to cushion them from the pandemic.“When they [police] come in the slums, their appetite is just to harass, extort, beat and kill,” Otieno told the Star, giving the [in]famous Mathare crime buster Ahmed Rashid as example.President Uhuru Kenyatta later apologised generally for the conduct of the police."
759,425 recoveries as three patients succumb to Covid-19,"Kenya on Sunday recorded 80 new virus cases, from a sample size of 1,601 tested in the last 24 hours.This brings the total number of confirmed positive cases in the country to 95,923.The cumulative tests now stand at 1,033,322.From the cases, 63 are Kenyans while 17 are foreigners.In terms of gender, 51 are males while 29 are females, and the youngest is a three-year-old child while the oldest is 98.On a good note, 425 patients have recovered from the disease with 369 from the home based care program while 56 have been discharged from various hospitals.The total number of recoveries in the country now stand at 77,423.Unfortunately, the country has lost three more patients to the disease, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,658.Currently, there are 651 patients admitted in various health facilities countrywide and 3,417 on home based isolation and care.38 patients are in ICU, 18 of whom are ventilatory support and 17 on supplemental oxygen, while three are on observation.Another 33 patients are desperately on supplementary oxygen, out of whom 26 are in the general wards.

760,Family seeks Sh3.5m for daughter's treatment in India,"Igdaliah Persida also known as Dash had a normal life until her second birthday when she was diagnosed with a brain tumour.It was a grade three tumour that is also known as ependymoma.She underwent her first surgery six months alter at St. Luke’s Hospital in Eldoret. Her mother Faith Ouso says the surgery changed her daughter's life.Igdaliah lost her sight for six months and has never walked again.“She went for further treatment in India in November 2015 where she underwent another surgery for the shunt which was successful,” the mother said.In March 2016, Igdaliah started her 30 session radiations in India before she travelled back home.“In July the same year, doctors informed us that the tumour was stubborn and that we needed to stay in India for eight months for her chemotherapy. She was to end the chemotherapy on December 31, 2016.""Luckily after the chemotherapy, the tumour was not growing and she was given take home chemo-medicine for six months.But this did not last long as in June 2017, the tumour was growing again. She had to fly back to India for a third time.According to the mother, the plan of the treatment this time round was to do a surgery then brainstem transplant.“The surgery was successful but the brainstem failed, she got an infection in the cerebrospinal fluid so the shunt had to drain outside the body,” she told the Star.As the infection was clearing up, Igdaliah got a clot in the brain and developed convulsions.“She had to go through another surgery to remove the clot and stayed in hospital for five months,” she added.In August 2019, doctors confirmed that the tumour was shrinking but the shunt was blocked.Igdaliah underwent another surgery but in ten days, the shunt blocked again forcing her to undergo yet another surgery.All the surgeries, were successful and she came back to Kenya in November 2019.“We were to travel to India in March 2020 but this never came to pass due to Covid-19 travel restrictions,” the mother said.Currently, Igdaliah has survived several radiations, chemotherapy and over 10 surgeries and her family calls her the girl with many lives.However, her condition is rapidly deteriorating. In May, she was admitted at Avenue Hospital in Kisumu for management.Igdaliah was discharged with a bill of about Sh700,000 which was paid by church members.By end of September, the girl had a relapse and was rushed to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu.“More than three litres of fluid was drained from her lungs but she has not improved,” the mother said.Despite the ongoing strike in the health sector, the girl remains in the High Dependency Unit as she cannot do without oxygen. Her condition is worsening and she needs help.“Her doctor in India confirmed that the shunt is blocked and we need Sh2 million for treatment. If you include accommodation and tickets it will cost around Sh3.5 million,” the mother said.Until last year, all the medical bills were footed by the NHIF comprehensive cover when the terms of the cover changed to Sh1 million per year.That means that the family can no longer afford Igdaliah’s treatment in India.To raise the funds, the family has started a crowd-funding drive targeting Sh3.5 million so she can fly to India for tests and chemotherapy.Though it has been a disruptive and painful six years with the the disease slowly sapping life out of the little angel, the family is strong-willed and hopeful.Contributions can be channelled to 0724 367272 or Pay Bill number 8030731. The account number is 1700180386096."
761,Kenyan women to receive world's first injection to stop HIV,"Kenyan women who took part in a study to test a long-acting injection to prevent HIV will become the first beneficiaries of the jab.The injection, administered once in two months, was hugely successful, and found to be 89 per cent efficient compared to pills to prevent infection. The World Health Organization said the rest of the public will have to wait for more than a year. The injection contains a specially formulated drug called Cabotegravir.""Participants who were in the TDF/FTC (the daily oral pills currently used for HIV prevention) arm will be offered cabotegravir long acting (CAB LA) and participants in the CAB LA arm will be able to continue to receive it,"" WHO said in a statementThe trial launched in 2017 enrolled 3,223 women aged between 18 and 45 years who were at higher risk of HIV infection in 20 sites across seven countries including Kenya.Other countries that participated in the trial were Uganda, South Africa, Malawi, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Eswatini.The study results announced early in November said cabotegravir injection is hugely effective when administered once every eight weeks.WHO now says despite the uplifting results, it is also important to temper expectations because there are still some important safety and implementation issues to address.""It is likely to be more than a year before CAB LA will be more widely available. However, now that these results showing its effectiveness in women are available, alongside the results for men who have sex with men and transgender women, plans for regulatory approval will move forward,"" WHO said. The injection, which must be administered by a professional, will be an addition to the current options available to prevent HIV. For instance, the Dapivirie ring, in July received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for its use among women aged 18 and older in developing countries to prevent the spread of HIV.The ring is placed in the vagina where it slowly releases the antiretroviral medicine dapivirine over 28 days.“The Dapivirine Ring is a discreet tool that women use to take care of their own health by preventing HIV infection” Dr Nelly Mugo, an obstetrician, gynaecologist and a principal research scientist, said in Nairobi.With consistent use, it is estimated that the vaginal ring can stop at least 60 per cent of HIV infections via vaginal sex.“In Kenya, 275 young women and girls are getting infected with HIV every week and the Dapivirine ring should contribute to the reduction of these new infections especially for young girls aged above 18,” Joyce Ouma, an AVAC fellow, told reporters."
762,Sonko snubs Ipoa after ouster,"Ex-Nairobi governor Mike Sonko snubbed an invitation to appear before the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) over alleged harassment by police.Sonko had been invited to appear the Authority on December 21, days after senators impeached him over alleged gross violation of the constitution, abuse of office and gross misconduct.However, the Star has established that Sonko gave the invite a wide berth.“He never appeared. We have tried to reach out to him but he has never responded,” Ipoa board member disclosed to the Star.Ipoa head of communication Dan Oketch said, “He is yet to come.”In the letter dated December 15 and received by the governor’s office the following day, Ipoa CEO Maina Njoroge notified Sonko that the authority was investigating an incident where the police allegedly stormed and disrupted his meeting with MCAs.The letter reads, “In exercise of its investigative mandate the authority is currently investigating alleged disruption of a meeting convened by you with members of the Nairobi city county assembly, your arrest and temporary detention on November 30, 2020, at Riverside within Nairobi County,’ reads the letter.""On this premise, the Authority requests you to appear before it on December 21, 2020 at 9am to shed light on the above stated allegations,"" the letter adds.On the day, tens of armed anti-riot police officers stormed Sonko’s meeting with about 40 MCAs who disowned signing the document to sanction his impeachment at a private residence on Riverside Drive.No sooner had the meeting started than the officers stormed the premises, teargassed Sonko, MCAs and journalists who were covering the event. They briefly arrested him before releasing him.The actions sparked outrage with Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja petitioning the Senate to investigate the police actions which he said amounts to intimidation and borders on breach of the former governor’s rights.Days before his impeachment, senate’s Justice and Legal Affairs committee gilled Ipoa chairperson Anne Makori over the incident.The committee directed the authority to investigate the incident and report to them within a week.But in his response to the committee, police IG Hillary Mutyambai denied the police arrested Sonko during his meeting with MCAs the private residence, adding that the officers only responded to a tip-off that the county boss and the ward reps were violating Covid 19 protocols.“The police did not respond with an intention to arrest the governor but to implement the Ministry of Health guidelines on Covid-19. Nobody was arrested during the incident. Police withdrew when the unlicensed meeting was dispersed,” he said"
763,Parties to submit names of aspirants for Nairobi governor race on Monday,"Political parties intending to sponsor candidates for the vacant Nairobi governor position will Monday submit the names of ticket contestants to the electoral commission.The poll to replace impeached Ex-governor Mike Sonko will be held on February 18, next year.Nairobi assembly speaker Benson Mutura was last Monday installed as acting governor because Sonko had no deputy at the time of his removal.Sources have told the Star there is intense haggling in the handshake team for a winning formula in the high-stakes battle.Senior Jubilee and ODM officials are to hold talks on Sunday to broker consensus on joint candidature for governor and deputy governor.“We are yet to agree on our handshake approach for this by-election but some officials are closing ranks in a common meeting to be held today (Sunday) before an announcement would be made,"" a senior Jubilee official said.BBI co-chair Dennis Waweru, Jesus is Alive Ministries’ Bishop Margret Wanjiru, ex-Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth are among the big names being fronted.ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna is being mentioned for the deputy governor post.Allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are plotting to parry away a potential challenge by Deputy President William Ruto's brigade.After today's meeting, the technical team will brief Raila and Uhuru on a possible deal for the handshake team.Sources told the Star that the Jubilee faction allied to the President will be fronting a governor candidate as ODM nominates the deputy governor.Nairobi ODM chairman George Aladwa said the handshake candidate will be the next governor for the capital.""We are working on every detail to ensure that we field joint candidates in the by-election,"" he told the Star. (edited by o. owino)"
764,"How social media, long school closure spiked missing children cases","Going by missing alerts put in the social media and mainstream media outlets since March this year, the Star can report that over 60 children from the age of two to 16 years have gone missing.  A conversation with most of the parents reveals that some of the children, especially those aged 10 years old and above sneaked out from home without any provocation and no clear reason would be offered.This comes hot in heals of latest media reports showing a group of 44 teenagers were busted by the police in a birthday cum sex party in Nairobi’s Mountain View area in November.The boys and girls, whose ages ranged from 11 to 18, were said to have come as far as Kericho and Machakos.Police reports showed that most of them, in early secondary school classes, had tricked their parents that they were going to get textbooks or revision papers.The police recovered over 100 empty alcohol bottles in the cupboard of the three-bedroom house.Reams of used condoms, rolls of bhang and dirty disposable cups with liquor and others with ashes of burnt bhang were also collected at the house.Untidy beds and couch cushions spread on the floor gave police a clear impression that birthday party quickly turned into sex orgies party.Further investigation reports also showed that most of the teens got invites on Instagram with links for registration and direction.Some of them, streamed live the action as it went down during the impugned party on social media. In fact, the police said in November that there were “cartels” that were using online platforms to lure unsuspecting teenagers to sex parties in the city.The DCI announced on Twitter that they were “hunting down members of the cartel and they'll be apprehended to answer for their crimes.”It also announced that child-protection detectives had rescued three of the seven girls who had been reported missing earlier that month.Efforts to trace the others were continuing, it said.Some of the girls, who included form four students, claimed that they had been lured off their homes by unknown people who promised modelling jobs.Detective, at the time, did not disclose where the girls were found or if any arrests had been made.According to the DCI, the alleged cartels operated from Nairobi and were using internationally registered telephone numbers.But psychologists explain that the fact that most of the school-going children have been at home due to the fast-spreading Coronavirus pandemic and hence are bored and emotionally exhausted.“I strongly suspect this is the reason most of them are escaping from home. They are bored being “caged” at home with their parents and family doing literally the same routines,” Florence Mwanga, a private clinical psychologist practising in Nairobi told the Star.Gregory Loch, a youth coach based in Nairobi, agrees. He said most of the young people bored at home and find social media as their outlet for connecting with their friends and falling to peer pressure.“Most of these missing children or young adult alert are not desperate situations. Most of them know where they are, mostly pursuing vain pleasure,” he said.Loch explained that most of the young people get exhausted by the firm restrained mounted by their parents and so when they get their free space, overindulge.It boils down to one thing, parenting, he said.IndisciplineIn some other cases, some of the children escaped from home when they had done a mistake and had been confronted for disciplinary action.For example, Moses Mwangi*, 7, ran from the home in Umoja at 5 pm when his father confronted him for dropping his radio set on the floor, spoiling it.The father told the Star, that since the closure of schools in March, his son had become increasingly reckless and lazy at home.“He had become a truant and difficult character, perhaps because of the company he kept,” he said. When Mwangi spoilt his radio set in June, the father confronted the son and threatened to cane him.The boy ran away and for two months, his family was in a search frenzy, sparing no effort to find him. He only emerged three months later in September."
765,Scandals that rocked the Health ministry in 2020,"“Let me tell you something. This building here called Afya House has some very good and very committed people. It has got people who work day and night, who work so hard in such difficult circumstances but this building here has got its fair share of criminals.”Those were the words of Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on May 27, barely three months into his tenure at Afya House.Kagwe decried how unscrupulous officers at the ministry were more concerned about their personal gain at the expense of service to citizens.The harder he tried to fight them, the harder they fought back, Kagwe appeared to suggest.But more was to come, as tenders for supply of Covid-19 equipment would be turned into a cash cow as medics suffered and cases skyrocketed.  In March, before Kagwe could settle into his new job, claims emerged of officials selling blood from the donor banks.The CS invited detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to probe the matter.Having just taken over from Sicily Kariuki, he wanted the detectives to help tackle the problem of perennial blood shortage in the country.“The ministry is aware that there are criminal elements both within the ministry of health who are colluding with outsiders to escalate the problems pertaining to blood countrywide,” Kagwe said.It is unclear what state the investigations are currently in and no one has been arrested.“I can’t really comment on the investigations that are currently going on.  The DCI has already stepped in and obviously when there is an investigation going on, you don’t want to disclose everything about it but what I can tell you is there is an investigation going on and we expect arrests to be made,” Kagwe said.Before the dust could settle on the alleged blood trade, the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. The Covid billionaires scandal came along.First, 21 packages of Covid-19 donations from Chinese billionaire Jack Ma went missing.  Transport CAS Chris Obure told Parliament’s Health Committee that 21 packages of assorted medical supplies did not reach Nairobi from Ethiopia.The CAS said the ministry realised that the 21 packages were missing after verifying with the packing documents from China.“We realised that 21 packages were short delivered, I assure you we will continue to pursue the matter with the Ministry of Health to ensure they are delivered,” Obure said.Kagwe said investigations into the matter were also going on.“Like any other marketplace there are few mad cases in here. And we will unearth them as we move on. These are people who will call a public officer, will call a businessman and tell them that they have got an order which they can help get getting,” Kagwe said.The whereabouts of the consignment remain unknown.But worse news came from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. As Covid-19 ravaged the country, an audit report revealed that some of the tenders to buy items to fight the pandemic were designed to siphon funds.A special audit by the Auditor General Nancy Gathangu showed that Kenyans lost Sh2.3 billion in the Covid-19 items procurement scandal at Kemsa.According to the auditor, Kemsa over-procured items worth Sh6.3 billion which are lying idle in its warehouses as health workers go on strike over PPE and other demands.If the items are sold at the current market prices, Kemsa will only recover Sh4 billion, leading to the Sh2.3 billion loss.""During the period under review, Kemsa irregularly utilised Universal Health Coverage and Capital Budget to procure Covid-19 related items worth Sh7,632,068,588 without evidence of approval of the budgets by relevant authorities,"" Gathangu said.The auditor noted some of the companies that were awarded the contract were established in January and February this year.The reports indicate that Kemsa failed to conduct market surveys for the items, thereby obtaining them at exaggerated prices.It also hand-picked non-prequalified suppliers with inadequate experience in the market and exposed public funds due to excess procurement of the items.Senators demanded the companies that supplied Kemsa and were paid be forced to take back their items to save the taxpayer from further losses.""There is no way you can register a company on January 22 and you are awarded a tender worth Sh900 million within three months. Which qualification do you have? When were you prequalified?"" Narok Senator Ledama Olekina asked as he pushed the auditor to reveal the directors of the companies.The companies – also under probe by EACC – signed commitment letters to deliver masks, PPE and other hospital consumables to the agency.No element of the tender was advertised, raising questions about how companies were identified and awarded contracts.In August, President Uhuru Kenyatta President Uhuru Kenyatta directed the evaluation and award of Kemsa tenders to be done online amid investigations of irregular use of billions of shillings for Covid-19 kits at the state agency.Uhuru gave the ministry 30 days to develop the online system where Kenyans will be able to view who has tendered, won contracts and the tender prices.“We want to see how the tender was evaluated, how people bid and how it was awarded. This level of transparency will help to manage resources of Kenyans taxpayers in an open and transparent manner,” the President said.Investigations by the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission into the Kemsa scandal are still ongoing. (edited by o. owino)"
766,"No longer so dynamic: How Uhuru, Ruto 'marriage' collapsed","As 2020 began, President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto were pulling in different directions.There was Ruto's early campaigning for the presidency, which Uhuru told him to stop. He didn't.Later came the wheelbarrow initiative and so-called hustler nation pitting the struggling go-getters against the dynasties controlling politics.The DP has showered wananchi with money to start businesses as well as wheelbarrows, sewing machines, carpentry tools, hairdressing equipment and many other things that have endeared him to many poor people.The compelling hustler narrative has made the government nervous. It said young people should depend on state development projects, savings plans and other inducements - not divisive slogans and trivial handouts. And as the year comes to an end, there's a chasm between the two leaders. They are reading from different hymn sheets, particularly on proposed amendments to the Constitution through the Building Bridges Initiative.The differences will no doubt spill over into 2021, the year Kenyans expect to go to a referendum to approve the BBI's proposed changes. The proposals are generating fierce debate but Uhuru is expected to prevail. Uhuru and Ruto – once UhuRuto, the 'dynamic duo' – have been at loggerheads in many instances in 2020. During the first months of 2020, it seemed only a matter of time before the two went their separate ways. Pundits say it's a question of when, not if.The relationship between the two started to crumble after Uhuru shook hands with long-time rival, ODM leader Raila Odinga on March 9, 2018.Ruto had been allegedly excluded from negotiations in the run-up to the peace pact that has made the ODM leader virtually a member of government, not the Opposition. But Uhuru said during the launch of the BBI report on October 26 that Ruto was involved all through, including in the selection of the task force members. The two pledged to work together to promote unity after the bitterly contested 2017 General Election.Political analyst Daniel Orogo said the Uhuru-Ruto open falling out in 2020 had been orchestrated by personal and political factors.“The war on corruption has been seen to target Ruto, the drastic changes [purge of Ruto allies] in the leadership in both Senate and the National Assembly and the reshuffling of parastatal heads are amongst political issues that have soured the relationship between the President and his deputy,” he said. Ruto's allies were purged from parliamentary committees while others faced disciplinary action in a Jubilee Party pruning of perceived rebels.In 2021, this sour, non-relationship between Uhuru and Ruto might escalate to open political rivalry and could become more vicious, he said.Orogo cited the referendum, the fight for heart and soul of the divided Jubilee Party and 2022 politics as factors that plunged the relationship to an all-time low.“Ruto will remove his gloves and might openly defy the President as he traverses the country and popularises the hustlers versus the dynasties political narrative,"" he said.Political commentator Joseph Mutua said the schism between Uhuru and Ruto is real and irredeemable.“I am seeing Uhuru and Raila coming up with a line up that will counter any move that Ruto makes. They will be keen not to give Ruto a chance,” he said.Ruto once was Uhuru's acknowledged heir-apparent.The differences will deepen as the 2022 General Election approaches, he said.Orogo said barring the DP from his political activities in the Jubilee Party headquarters is likely to be another source of conflict in 2021.He has hinted at leaving Jubilee.“The DP will probably mount a war with the party secretariat. The strategy will be to retain the party position and eject his rivals through the party PG or dismantle the Jubilee party functions and lead a walkout with a sizeable number of MPs, governors and insiders. This will definitely attract the President's reaction,” he added.Raila has been cited as the biggest reason for the strained relationship between Uhuru and Ruto.When Uhuru reorganised his Cabinet in January, the effects of the handshake were obvious.Ruto has also moved into Uhuru's Mt Kenya turf without the President's blessings. He has won the hearts of many in the President's backyard.Pundits say by invading Mt Kenya, Ruto was trying to inherit President Kenyatta’s seat long before his term comes to an end. The ugly face of political defiance is being manifested, he said.“In other terms, he will be communicating to Kenyans that he is no longer willing to share in the President's Big 4 agenda failure and the tainted image of the failed Jubilee government,” Orogo said.Several of Ruto’s allies have also been implicated in corruption scandals and supporters said they were being targeted. The Director of Public Prosecutions denies this and says he follows the facts and the money.As the year progressed, the Team Tangatanga- associated with the DP -became emboldened in their opposition to Uhuru.Ruto has also sharply criticised the BBI initiative dear to the President. He set out five 'irreducible minimums' for his support.Privately, he conceded, he cannot publicly confront his boss for fear of losing his support.Speaking at a funeral in October, Ruto, termed the Nyanza BBI forum in Kisii a waste of public funds. He warned civil servants who facilitated the event their days were numbered - when he eventually ascends to power.The Kenya National Elders Council said it would not relent in its drive to reconcile Uhuru and Ruto. Efforts so far have failed as neither side sees much gain in making nice.Lengthy separate talks came to naught.Foreign donors and potential investors have been put off by rising political tension and violence, which has since subsided a bit.The council under the leadership of Captain (Rtd) Kung’u Muigai said their mission is not political and aims to unite the country's  leadership, not just Uhuru and Ruto.“The move to preach unity and peace was an initiative of the elders and not Uhuru's or any other leader,” Muigai said.Ruto has also repeatedly accused Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti of being used by the state to undermine his office.The DP also has a strained relationship with Interior CS Fred Matiang'i - now the 'super minister' - and his PS Karanja Kibicho.At Jubilee headquarters, Ruto has been engaged in a battle with secretary-general Raphael Tuju and party vice chairman David Murathe.Ruto has openly called Tuju and Murathe busybodies, conmen and brokers who have hijacked the party.Tuju announced they had kick-started the process of removing Ruto as the Jubilee second in command.“The NMC has recommended to the NEC that the DP ceases to be Deputy Party leader after he opened the so-called Jubilee Asili offices that is reserved for him and his allies until such a time that this development of Jubilee Asili is discussed at the NEC,” Tuju said.In September, legislators allied to Ruto accused Uhuru of failing to offer leadership in Jubilee Party.Jubilee Party deputy secretary-general Caleb Kositany termed the ongoing differences “a failure by the leadership”. (Edited by V.

767,Big Four agenda falters as Uhuru rushes push BBI legacy,"President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy - the Big Four - has lost traction as BBI and 2022 succession politics take centre stage. The President had listed food security, affordable housing and healthcare and industrialisation as the Big Four Agenda to be well underway before he exits State House.His administration has injected close to Sh1.3 trillion on key projects to drive the Big Four.However, with the economy battered the Covid-19 pandemic and more resources being diverted to deliver the BBI referendum, the President now risks retiring without much to write home about.Long before Covid hit in March, however, experts were saying there wasn't enough money to properly fund the Big Four.In a bold report to Parliament in February 2019, the Budget Committee expressed doubt that Treasury’s budgetary allocations to the Big Four  are enough to achieve any meaningful outcome.The country is burdened by debt, voracious borrowing, a bloated wage bill and corruption that sucks up development money.During his seventh State of the Nation address in November, President Kenyatta appeared shift description of the Big Four from projects to a framework.""The Big Four is not a project as many may think. It is a strategy or framework that I have used to organise government delivery.""The President who will vacate office in fewer than 21 months told parliamentarians that economic development is not about intentions but results.“It is not the volume of what we did, but the impact of what we achieved. Economic development is the measure of tangible positive transformation of the wellbeing and quality of life in our people,” Uhuru told the MPs.The President said despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, his administration has made great strides in rolling out Universal Health Coverage, one pillar of the Big Four agenda.Uhuru’s regime has also made achievements in transport, rail and road infrastructure. Major new roads have been built and airport rail transport has been revived. Nairobi rail and bus transit is becoming a reality.Progress has been made in food security and promoting manufacturing and industrialisation. However, the President administration has has been accused of embarking on too many expensive projects that require overborrowing from both local and international lenders.Compared to former President Mwai Kibaki who rallied Kenyans to pay taxes to finance development, Uhuru has demonstrated such an appetite for loans that the next administration could be hobbled by debt repayment. That could mean much less development.Governance expert Prof Kaburu Kinoti said that Uhuru’s development agenda became a ""lost cause""  when he decided to focus on the BBI, now described as a legacy, along with national unity.The university don said the President “prioritises nothing except when he is advancing political causes to help himself politically, his friends or family business.“His record of failures in pulling through programmes that would have done greater public good is testament to a leader who perhaps was not cut out to bring the meaningful change that Kenya deserves in this era,” Kinoti told the Star.He added, “He would rather ignore the struggles and hopes of the people he leads and concentrate on BBI that secures his future political interests irrespective of the damage to the social and economic interests of this generation and generations to come.”According to Kinoti, for Uhuru to get back to the development trajectory, he should abandon BBI and 2022 succession politics, saying they have diverted the attention and energy of the country. “Uhuru's legacy was hinged on the Big Four. The success of the blueprint would have had a lasting impact on the lives of citizens. It would have been easy for him to secure his legacy had he remained focused,” he said.“Unfortunately there is real danger that both projects are going to fail. The Big Four has failed and there is a high likelihood the BBI project will fail as well. Kenyans will reject BBI after which Uhuru’s political career will end with nothing much to be remember,” he added.However, Uhuru's track record on the Big Four was described as ""so far so good"" by David Pkosing, chairman of the Transport, Public Works and Housing committee of the National Assembly.The Pokot South MP said the Jubilee administration has exceeded the mark in terms of roads, a major enabler of the Big Four.He said, however, the Uhuru regime should have done better in the housing sector.“My committee and other committees of Parliament have facilitated what is required for the Big Four Agenda to be rolled out. We must hand it to the Jubilee government in terms of road networks,"" Pkosing said.A significant road has been constructed or is being constructed in each of the four counties,"" he told he Star.“The housing model ran into problems as the matter remained in the courts for a long time before it was determined.  The government here has done well but could have done better,"" he said."

769,What Covid-19 taught Kenyans in 2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide with nearly 78.7 million infections as at December 24. With over 1.73 million deaths, it is easy to see why stringent measures had to be taken by governments globally to curb the infection rate.Many different tactics were put in place to minimize the risk of infections while still being able to run the economy and keep the people fed, clothed and housed.  The most commonly practiced technique of these measures is advising people to stay home and try minimize contact with other people. In doing this, the novel coronavirus has less hosts to infect and thus the spread is greatly reduced. But how can all the people of a society be asked to remain in their homes for months on end while still being expected to deliver on their work load and hope to get paid at the end of the month? Where will the food they need to survive come from? How is the economy supposed to stay running while millions of people lose their jobs and are forced to stay home, thus not earning the money that they so desperately need to keep the lights on and food on their table? It has been well over eight months since the first case was recorded in the country. Communities have had to shift their focus to survival. Millions of Kenyans have been laid off from their jobs yet many of them were depended on by their families and next of kin. How do those they were working so hard to support, survive this pandemic without the crumbs that they were receiving from their honest and hardworking families? Every single person has to adjust to a new life. What has been termed as 'the new normal' which consists of rules and regulations must be adhered to by the people of a country to help curb the spread of the virus.  Some of these rules are; wearing of PPEs in the form of facemasks, carrying around hand sanitizer and maintaining a social distance of 1.5 meters when out in public, for those that must  be out and about and cannot work from home. All these contingencies must be followed to the letter to ensure that a very small number of the general public become infected by the virus. The problem is, some of these measures are challenging to follow, especially for those with underlying health issues. There are some people who find it hard to breathe through the face masks.Moreover, let's not forget about the fact that most Kenyans don't like to follow rules anyway, so you may find that even though someone could have stayed home and avoided the risk of catching this virus, they instead opt to go visit a friend, or enjoy a meal or drinks with some companions. Some even go as far as to not wear PPEs, for reasons unknown. It could be out of protest, genuine inability to function while wearing them or even in some cases straight up rebelliousness. Whatever the case, the risk of either catching or spreading the virus is still very much palpable. Small businesses and big companies have also been affected by the resurgence of the virus and have put in place their own set of guidelines to keep their employees safe while still maintaining a safe environment for their customers and clients. There are some establishments that will not allow people into their premises without a mask on their face and a body temperature exceeding 37 degrees centigrade. All this is to ensure smooth operations of the business keep flowing while maintaining caution and safety for all.Kenyans are a following type of people, in the sense that we really take to heart what our leaders say and do. And while people are dying in hospitals or in their homes, the leaders are simply moving on with their lives and campaigning for their future aspirations, instead of rallying behind its people to help heal the nation and secure our children's future. The result of these shenanigans by our leaders, is the complete and utter disregard by the people, of the stringent measures set in place to try protect our nation from the deadly coronavirus. This in turn affects every single person in the country because the day that everything can return to normal keeps getting pushed forward by the daily increase of infections and deaths. There is a lot of blame that can be thrown around, but ultimately it is up to us as individuals to face the reality of the situation and become our brothers and sisters keepers. Don't just sit back and wait for a solution to be provided; save your fellow neighbour from risk by adhering to the measures set in place by the WHO and enforced by the government. There is no need to feel 'special', thus relaxing from your obligation to stay alive and healthy by trying to show or prove something that doesn't exist. Let's learn to put aside our pride and ego's for the sake of our children and future generations. Until a stable, more viable and long term solution is created, it is our duty to stay at home where possible and follow the guidelines set in place to help us avoid getting infected. As the Health CS Muthi Kagwe said, ""If we treat this virus normally, it will treat us abnormally."""
770,"Nurses threaten to withdraw services at KNH, MTRH","The nurses’ union has threatened to withdraw services in Kenyatta National Hospital and the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital should the ongoing strike remain unresolved in the next seven days.Nurses in the two referral hospitals had been exempted from the strike by the union based on the fact that most of the issues raised had been addressed by the hospital boards.While speaking in Nairobi on Saturday, the Kenya National Union of Nurses SG Seth Panyako said the nurses are the most important in the health sector, adding that despite the ministry signed a return to work agreement with doctors, hospitals are still not functioning.Doctors on Thursday called off their strike after signing a return to work formula with the government.The nurses and clinical officers have been on strike for the past 20 days with more than six meetings scheduled to find a solution proving abortive.As at Saturday, 34 nurses had succumbed to Covid-19 in their line of duty.“I have not heard any government official wanting to know why there is no strike in MTRH and KNH, but they are very busy coming to say there is no strike in the national referral hospital. They think it is by accident, it is by design,” Panyako said.“We are ready to sit on the table I am a leader, I know you are a government official, I know you are powerful; you can order my arrest but let me tell you history will judge you so harshly.”The SG noted that the focus should be on the issues that have taken nurses out of hospitals, adding that health centres which are affordable to Kenyans are manned by nurses and clinical officers yet they remain closed due to the strike.The healthcare workers have been on strike demanding for provision of quality and standard PPEs, comprehensive medical cover, risk allowance, hiring of more healthcare workers and dedicated health facilities per county for those who contract Covid-19 while on duty.The nurses are blaming the government of abandoning conciliatory talks adding the negotiation stalled after threats were issued by the CS.“The nurses are the hospitals; the nurses are the healthcare system. We are the central nervous system of the hospital and there is no hospital that can function when the central nervous system has broken down,” the SG said.Panyako also said the nurses will not be going back to work until the government lays bare the evidence on which the medical cover provided by each county government, adding that only nurses in counties that have met the demands will be allowed to resume duty.“Stop calling health workers names. When you call us names we will call you names. When you say we are drunkards we get Covid by drinking in bars we will also tell you you are a drunkard because it is only a drunkard who can tell us we are getting Covid from bars.”"
771,Kenya's Covid-19 positivity rate remains below 10 per cent,"Kenya has maintained a Covid-19 positivity rate of below 10 per cent for a week running with 130 new cases reported on Saturday.This was from a sample of 1,973 which represents a positivity rate of 6.5 per cent.This now brings the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 95,843 from cumulative tests of 1,031,721 samples.From the new cases, 113 are Kenyans while 17 are foreigners. Gender wise, 81 are males and 49 are females.The youngest is a four-year-old child while the oldest is 83 years old.In terms of recoveries, 187 patients have recovered from the disease with 93 from the home-based care program while 94 have been discharged from different health facilities, bringing the total number of recoveries in the country to 76,998.Unfortunately, the country has lost two more patients to the disease, bringing the total number of fatalities to 1,655.Currently, there are 681 patients admitted in various health facilities countrywide and 3,650 on home-based isolation and care.38 patients are in ICU, 19 of whom are on ventilatory support and 16 on supplementary oxygen. Three are on observation.Another 33 patients are separately on supplementary oxygen out of whom 26 are in the general wards. Seven are in the High Dependency Unit (HDU)."
772,IPOA opens probe on Nakuru police assault on motorist,"The Independent  Policing Oversight Authority has launched investigations on three police offices caught on camera assaulting a motorist.The three were captured in a video assaulting the motorist and a journalist who recorded the incident in Nakuru County.""Consequently, IPOA on its own motion has this afternoon launched investigations into the assault and injury of the two people,"" IPOA chairperson Anne Makori said in a statement.She added that in the course of investigations if culpability is found or further misconduct established, the Authority will make appropriate recommendations against the police officers.In the video, the motorist was seen confronting one police officer for allegedly hitting his car.The two started getting physical before two other police officers - a man and a woman- joined in and the three started beating the man.The second male officer noticed the journalist recording the incident and charged at him injuring him.But in response, the National Police Service on Saturday said that the video circulating has not shown the full incident as it occurred.""The said motorist was stopped while overlapping along the busy Nairobi Nakuru highway. Upon stopping he assaulted the police officer. Members of the public alerted the rest of the officers who were on the opposite side of the road. The officers gave a reinforcement and managed to subdue him and effected his arrest,"" the NPS said in a post on Twitter."
773,UN peacekeepers killed in Central African Republic before election,"Three United Nations peacekeepers were killed in Central African Republic, the U.N. mission there said on Saturday, as the government and its allies tried to fend off a rebel offensive ahead of Sunday's presidential and legislative elections.The Burundian peacekeepers were killed on Friday by unidentified assailants in Dekoa, about 200 km (125 miles) north of the capital Bangui, according to the U.N. mission, known as MINUSCA. Two more were injured, it said.Peacekeepers were also attacked by unknown assailants in Bakouma in the southwest of the country, MINUSCA added.Central African Republic, which is rich in diamonds, timber and gold, has experienced five coups and numerous rebellions since independence from France in 1960. It has been gripped by insecurity since former President Francois Bozize was ousted by a rebellion in 2013.President Faustin-Archange Touadera is seeking a second term governing the country of five million on Sunday. On Saturday, the constitutional court denied opposition requests to delay the elections, ensuring they will go ahead as planned.The court rejected Bozize's presidential candidacy earlier this month, saying he did not satisfy the ""good morality"" requirement because of an arrest warrant and U.N. sanctions against him for allegedly ordering assassinations, torture and other crimes when he was president.The United Nations also accuses him of collaborating with a coalition of militias to prevent the elections from going ahead.Bozize has denied ordering or committing crimes when he was president while his party, the main opposition, has denied the U.N. allegation, saying they have no links to militia or rebels.Reuters has not been able to reach Bozize for comment.Attacks by rebel groups opposed to Touadera surged after the court rejected Bozize's candidacy. They briefly seized the country's fourth-largest city this week before being pushed back.Underscoring the fragility of the security situation, the army's chief of staff said on Friday that a number of soldiers had deserted and told them to immediately rejoin their units.President Touadera's international security partners, including Russia, France and Rwanda, have responded to the violence by sending troops and equipment.Three hundred Rwandan peacekeepers arrived from South Sudan on Thursday, MINUSCA said, while two Russian military helicopters were offloaded from a cargo plane at Bangui airport on Friday, according to photos and government sources.(Writing by Aaron Ross; Editing by Pravin Char)"
774,"Revenue sharing: Drama, intrigues that brought Kenya to a standstill","Bribery claims, arrests, tears, intimidation - and no money.These were some of woes Kenyans were subjected to during the roller-coaster Senate revenue-sharing debate in August and September.As lawmakers argued, postured and politicked, counties were starved of cash during the Covid-19 pandemic.Finally, there was agreement on September 17 after President Uhuru Kenyatta sweetened the pot with Sh53.5 billion, compromises were made and agreement reached to delay painful cuts. Supporters were banking on the BBI referendum approval to increase county allocations to 35 per cent.No county loses in the short term. The amount to be shared was Sh316.5 billion, before Uhuru's sweetener, which will be factored into the 2021-22 budget.Meantime, Kenya was nearly brought to a standstill and the Council of Governors said counties would shut down if the Senate didn't swiftly resolve the politicised impasse.The Senate had failed an unprecedented 10 times to pass the Revenue Bill, aka third-generation formula, that would base allocations primarily on population.This would benefit President Uhuru Kenyatta's populous Mt Kenya backyard and other regions. It would disadvantage ODM leader Raila Odinga's traditional strongholds of Coast and areas with huge landmass and smaller population.Raila, traditional champion of the downtrodden, wants the Mt Kenya vote.Marginalised areas complained Raila had abandoned them. They stood to lose Sh17 billion.The ODM boss backtracked, said he'd just returned from a trip and had been misinformed. He called for compromise.There were claims senators from disadvantaged counties were bribed to shoot down the state's favoured formula. They denied wrondoing.THE FORMULACritics said that formula would sow division among Kenyans. They recommended other weighted parameters such as health, agriculture, poverty, land area, roads and infrastructure.The debate caused a storm.The formula determines county allocations for five years until 2023-24.The formula is based on 10 parameters: health (17 per cent), agriculture (10), other county services (18), basic minimum share (20), land area (eight per cent), roads (four), poverty (14), urban services (five), fiscal effort (two) and fiscal prudence (two).ARRESTSDuring the period of debate some legislators were arrested in what they termed as intimidation.Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala - a critic of the state formula - was arrested on August 17 after a 10-hour standoff. He was driven from Nairobi to Mumias to face charges of violating Covid-10 containment measures.He had been addressing a crowd and distributing sanitiser.Malala and counterparts Bomet’s Chris Langat and Samburu’s Steve Lelegwe were arrested and driven to their counties for grilling.They opposed the formula backed by the state and by Raila.The arrests triggered a storm. Some senators accused state functionaries of 'unleashing terror' on their colleagues holding divergent views.Senators immediately linked the trio's arrest to the deadlocked debate on the contentious formula.Malala broke down in tears before the Senate Security and Intelligence Committee, saying he was the target of an assassination plot.'ONE KENYA'The senators, whose counties were set to lose Sh17 billion in the disputed state-backed formula, teamed up to approve amendments to the proposal.Known as 'One Kenya', they pushed through amendments to change aspects of the formula.In the amendments, Senator Mithika Linturi of Meru reduced the baseline (equal share) from Sh316.5 billion as proposed by Nairobi's Johnson Sakaja to Sh270 billion.Linturi suggested other parameters  should apply to the difference - Sh46.5 billion.Sakaja suggested the entire Sh316.5 billion allocated to the 47 counties in the current financial year be shared equally.In the Linturi proposal, 19 counties would lose Sh1.8 billion, down from Sh17 billion contained in the disputed formula proposed by the House Finance and Budget Committee.Losers in the Linturi proposal would be Mandera (Sh245.2 million), Kwale (Sh177.9 million), Wajir (Sh175.6), Marsabit (Sh156.9 million), Kilifi (Sh153.4) and Mombasa (Sh135.1 million).COUNTIES STALEMATECoG chairman Wycliff Oparanya announced all county services would be paralysed after the senators failed to agree.He said county health facilities will not permit any new admissions.All non-essential services were suspended and county employees advised to proceed on leave for two weeks.He said county staff, including frontline health workers, had not been paid for three months.TEAM FORMEDThe Senate failed in 10 sittings to approve the formula after a section of the lawmakers whose counties would lose money in the proposal, rejected it.In the disputed formula proposed by the House Finance and Budget Committee, 18 counties were losing Sh17 billion from their allocation last year.Because of the wrangles and standoff, a team was formed to come up with a compromise formula.The committee included Senators Sakaja, Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni), Susan Kihika (Nakuru), Samson Cherargei (Nandi), Moses Kajwang' (Homa Bay), Ledama Olekina (Narok), Moses Wetang'ula (Bungoma), Anwar Loitiptip (Lamu), Stewart Madazyo (Kilifi), Nderitu Kinyua (Laikipia) and Mahamud Mohamed (Mandera).The committee haggled for days without agreement.‘NOT MY MONEY’President Uhuru Kenyatta distanced himself from the standoff.“This is not Uhuru’s money. This formula was crafted by the Commission on Revenue Allocation and went to the Senate. The revenue should be shared justifiably such that everyone gets their fair share,” Uhuru said.Deputy President William Ruto, on the other hand, appealed for a formula that would not disadvantage any of the 47 counties but ensure devolution is strengthened. ""It should be guided by a win-win situation whereby populous counties get their fair share of revenue just as those considered marginalised or geographically small,” Ruto said at his Sugoi home in Uasin Gishu.Raila said the standoff deprived counties of resources to operate. He urged senators to expeditiously resolve the matter.“Revenue sharing has taken a lot of time in the Senate. The standoff is interfering with county services,"" he said.IT’S A YES!The 12-member Senate committee tasked with developing a win-win formula after the President pledged an additional Sh50 billion allocation to counties, reached a consensus.On September 17, senators unanimously approved the third basis for revenue sharing.All 41 senators present voted to approve the formula.The  formula considers eight parameters; Basic share (20 per cent), Population (18 per cent), Health (17 per cent), Poverty Level (14 per cent), Agriculture (10 per cent), Roads (eight per cent), Land (eight per cent) and Urban (five per cent).No county loses revenue."
775,"George Blake, last of Cold War spies who betrayed Britain, dies at 98","George Blake, who died in Russia on Saturday at the age of 98, was the last in a line of British spies whose secret work for the Soviet Union humiliated the intelligence establishment when it was discovered at the height of the Cold War.Britain says he exposed the identities of hundreds of Western agents across Eastern Europe in the 1950s, some of whom were executed as a result of his treason.His case was among the most notorious of the Cold War, alongside those of a separate ring of British double agents known as the Cambridge Five.Unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1961, Blake was sentenced to 42 years in London's Wormwood Scrubs prison. In a classic cloak-and-dagger story, he escaped in 1966 with the help of other inmates and two peace activists, and was smuggled out of Britain in a camper van.He made it through Western Europe undiscovered and crossed the Iron Curtain into East Berlin.He spent the rest of his life in the Soviet Union and then Russia, where he was feted as a hero.Reflecting on his life in an interview with Reuters in Moscow in 1991, Blake said he had believed the world was on the eve of Communism.""It was an ideal which, if it could have been achieved, would have been well worth it,"" he said.""I thought it could be, and I did what I could to help it, to build such a society. It has not proved possible. But I think it is a noble idea and I think humanity will return to it."" BECOMING A COMMITTED COMMUNISTBlake was born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands on Nov. 11, 1922, to a Dutch mother and an Egyptian Jewish father who was a naturalised Briton.He escaped from the Netherlands in World War Two after joining the Dutch resistance as a courier and reached Britain in January 1943. After joining the British navy, he started working for the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, in 1944.After the war, Blake served briefly in the German city of Hamburg and studied Russian at Cambridge University before being sent in 1948 to Seoul where he gathered intelligence on Communist North Korea, Communist China and the Soviet Far East.He was captured and imprisoned when North Korean troops took Seoul after the Korean War began in 1950. It was during his time in a North Korean prison that he became a committed Communist, reading the works of Karl Marx and feeling outrage at heavy U.S. bombing of North Korea.After his release in 1953, he returned to Britain and in 1955 was sent by MI6 to Berlin, where he collected information on Soviet spies but also passed secrets to Moscow about British and U.S operations. ""I met a Soviet comrade about once a month,"" he said in a 2012 interview published by Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.Blake described how, for these meetings, he had travelled to the Soviet-controlled sector of Berlin on a rail link joining different parts of the divided city. His contact would be waiting for him in a car and they would go to a safe house.""I handed over films and we chatted. Sometimes we had a glass of Tsimlyansk champagne (Soviet sparkling wine).""Blake was eventually exposed by a Polish defector and brought home to Britain, where he was sentenced and jailed.When he escaped from Wormwood Scrubs, he left behind his wife, Gillian, and three children. After Gillian divorced him, Blake married a Soviet woman, Ida, with whom he had a son, Misha. He worked at a foreign affairs institute before retiring with her to a dacha, or country house, outside Moscow.SIPPING MARTINIS WITH PHILBYBlake, who went by the Russian name Georgy Ivanovich, was awarded a medal by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007 and held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the former KGB security service, from which he received a pension.""These are the happiest years of my life, and the most peaceful,"" Blake said in the 2012 interview marking his 90th birthday. By then, he said, his eyesight was failing and he was ""virtually blind"". He did not voice regret about his past.""Looking back on my life, everything seems logical and natural,"" he said, describing himself as happy and lucky.Though he worked separately from the Cambridge Five - a spy ring of former Cambridge students who passed information to the Soviet Union - Blake said that during his retirement he got to know two of them, Donald Maclean and Kim Philby.He reminisced about drinking martinis, the preferred cocktail of fictitious British spy James Bond, with Philby but said he was closer in spirit to Maclean.Maclean died in Russia in 1983, and Philby in 1988. Of the rest of the Cambridge Five, Guy Burgess died in Russia in 1963, and Anthony Blunt in London in 1983.John Cairncross, the last to be publicly identified by investigative journalists and former Soviet intelligence officers, died in England in 1995."

778,"Unemployment to blame for violence, siege mentality of boda boda operators","Last month, a viral video in which rogue boda boda riders are seen attacking a driver after he hit their colleague sparked public outrage over indiscipline among operators.The incident which happened along Thika Road, involving a motor vehicle and a motorbike, saw GSU officers manning the nearby facility intervene to rescue the motorist.Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai while condemning the act called on police to move swiftly and take action.This is, however, one among many incidences that boda boda operators have wreaked havoc on Kenyan roads.The motorcycle business known as “Boda-boda” has continued to play a critical role in easing the transportation problem of connecting urban and rural areas in Kenya.Said to have originated in the early 1990s from Uganda through Busia town in western Kenya, the two-wheel motor vehicle spread to adjacent towns, subsequently, other towns and all towns currently are crowded with boda bodas.Currently, the boda boda business in the country is booming, since it is readily available in urban and rural areas and people always transport goods to and fro and uses paths instead of roads given that feeder roads in Kenya are impassable during rainy seasons.The industry has over the years grown to create employment for many young people in the country with the unemployment rate soaring in the country each day.The industry has emerged as one of the biggest revenue-generating sectors in the economy and proved to be a key contributor to the economy by generating a whopping Sh357billion in revenue annually.The National Crime Research Centre indicates that the explosion of boda boda in public transport in the country has taken a similar trajectory to the matatus industry - which operated illegally and thrived on lawlessness when they were first introduced in Kenya in the 1960 -70s.The rise the centre says is attributable to among other factors the inability of the transport system to cater for transport needs of Kenyans, poor transport infrastructure, the 2008 government policy zero-rating motorcycles below 250cc leading to drop in motorcycle prices and widespread youth unemployment that pushed youths to embrace boda bodas as a source of employment.According to the National Transport and Safety Authority, there are about 1.4 million registered motorcycles in the country although the exact number of boda-bodas operating in Kenya has not been well documented.This is due to the fact that some of them are not registered as required by the law and further, the sector is not well regulated.Over 65 per cent are not registered with one motorbike being operated by more than three people.The registered commercial motorcycles on Kenyan roads each make Sh1,000 on average on daily basis.This is through moving people and goods over short distances charging as low as Sh50. President Uhuru Kenyatta earlier on said about 5.2 million people in the country depend on each motorcycle operator for their daily livelihood translating to 10 per cent of the population.“I have been in this business for the last five years since I lost my job. Though life has never been the same, I manage to pay rent and put a meal on the table,” David Owino who operates in Umoja said.The father of three said through the bodaboda business he is able to pay school fees for his daughter who is now a candidate and the other two boys who are upper primary and lower primary respectively.“The highest you can charge for a distance is Sh100. Majority of passengers here travel for short distances and we charge between Sh50 and Sh100. On a good day, I would make at least Sh1000,” he said.Owino said when he lost his job, he spent so much time looking for an alternative until he took a loan to buy a motorcycle.Since then he has repaid the loan and he is happy.Rashid Odanga who operates within the CBD says he lives each day as it comes.For him, venturing in the boda boda industry needs a thick heart especially when the area of operation in town.“Here competition is high. We don’t have any specific rates, it depends on how the customer negotiates with you,” he said.Odanga, a school dropout said the chamas they have formed as operators is what makes them proud of what they are.“Through this chama I have managed to build myself a three-bedroomed home back at upcountry, I have a wife and two kids whom I strive to see live a better life,” he said.Odanga said the only challenge they have is being victimised by authorities as gangsters.Every day they are on high alert because if it is not police hunting them, the county askari’s will be on their case.If only the government can help us be recognised in the transport sector as the Tuktuks, we shall have won big. For now, we survive each day as it comes,” he said.In areas with poor road networks, boda bodas are considered the most viable option while in Nairobi’s highways, they are used by those seeking to skip traffic snarl-ups.Though hyped as a viable income-generating activity for the youth, the sector has turned into a source of misery, economic burdens, physical and psychological pain.The underlying factor has however been the number of accidents involving these boda boda operators.As the country moves towards realisation of modern infrastructure in terms of roads, the situation could get worse according to the completion of high-speed and high-impact roads with the risk of increased serious and fatal injuries.According to NTSA, by the end of October 2020 about 884 motorcyclists lost their lives compared to the same period in 2019 where 597 lost their lives.This according to the safety authority was a variance of 48 per cent.In the same period, 350 pillion Passengers lost their lives compared to 277 in 2019. This was a variance of 26 per cent.NTSA indicates that these motorcyclists are often involved in accidents due to lack of training on road safety, negative attitude, impunity, disregard of the law, decentralisation of traffic police functions, unregulated sector, abuse of drugs and alcohol.As a result, traffic police officers find it hard to deal with these operators because they flout traffic rules with impunity, leading to unnecessary but fatal accidents.NTSA recommends that enforcement must concentrate on this sector to end the kind of gangsterism associated with the sector.“The operators notoriously use wrong lanes, make U-turns in undesignated areas, do not obey traffic lights and pedestrian crossing signs, ride along pavements and rarely use safety gear,” Nairobi traffic police Joshua Omukata said.“Move to any police station within the City, you are welcome by piles of written off motorcycles detained characterised by this impunity,” he added.The police boss said the problem is that anyone thinking of making money simply purchases or acquires a motorbike and hits the road without being subjected to any scrutiny by relevant authorities.“We cannot blame NTSA for this mess, the problems we are facing are largely attributed to people who enter this business with bad intentions,” he said.He said as much as everyone would want police to take stern action against offending riders, it is hard to crack down on them as they easily manoeuvre and escape police traps.A report dubbed, ‘Motorcycle injuries at a tertiary referral hospital in Kenya’ indicates that the rise in the use of motorcycles in Kenya in the last 10 years has been associated with increased injury rates.In a hospital like Kenyatta National Hospital, motorcycle users have become the predominant road user category injured.Motorcycle trauma admissions comprise the largest percentage of all road traffic injury admissions with male riders dominating the category.According to police, half of the riders and 20 per cent of passengers use protective helmets with head and neck injuries being the most reported.Those admitted to hospitals may stay up to one month with the cost of treatment going beyond Sh100,000.While some may need surgical interventions, others end up dying depending on the severity of the injuries they encountered.The report indicates the high mortality rate, need for surgery in the majority of patients, and prolonged admission days call for motorcycle control and expedited care.Significant head injury mortality calls for efforts to embrace helmet laws for riders and passengers.The report by the National Crime Research Centre indicates Kenya does not have a database of all motorcycles that operate as boda bodas and the subsector is therefore not effectively policed, regulated and monitored.This is partly the reason for the wanton recklessness, impunity, violence and siege mentality of boda boda operators.“When the boda boda industry is dominated by a fairly youthful population of men who are not professionally trained, less educated and of lower socio-economic standing - operating in a context of weak registration, policing, regulation and oversight, the end result is crime, impunity, deaths and injuries with grave implications for public safety,” the report reads.The report further reveals that there is a lacuna in the legal framework under which boda bodas operate in public transport as public service vehicles.“Kenya does not have a policy framework in place to register boda bodas as PSV equivalent to what the Transport Licensing Board (TLB) does with the registration and designation of private vehicles or matatus into PSV’s and their specific routes of operation,” it said.Moreover, TLB has a mandatory provision that matatus have to be registered with a company or Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization (SACCO) to operate in Kenya.According to the report, for boda bodas, it is on the acquisition of a PSV motorcycle insurance cover (that many don’t have) they undertake commercial public transport services.Two years ago, NTSA introduced a raft of measures to curtail the boda boda operations.The envisaged regulations have had little impact as people continue to suffer.These included compelling suppliers and dealers of two- and three-wheeled motorcycles to ensure they only sell vehicles complete with two helmets and two reflective jackets.Helmets and jackets should bear the registration number of the motorcycle.“No supplier, distributor or person involved in the business of selling motorcycles in Kenya shall sell, distribute or otherwise convey a motorcycle without the protective gear,” NTSA said.In addition, owners of motorcycles were to ensure only riders who hold a valid driving licence or a valid provisional licence endorsed in respect of that class of motorcycle is permitted to ride the motorcycle. Under the new regulations, all riders were to have a public service vehicle (PSV) insurance, a valid license and minimum third party insurance and be registered by the authority.The regulations also restricted the carriage of loads to 15cm width beyond the handlebars, to a height of 2m from the ground, and with no rear projection extending more than 60cm beyond the end of the motorcycle.The regulations also forbid loads dragging on the road with the number of passengers being limited to one who, with the exception of someone with a disability.“Boda bodas are increasingly becoming entrenched in Kenya along the matatu industry trajectory - that operated illegally and thrived on lawlessness. Therefore, the informal, unregulated nature and the weak governance framework for the boda boda sub-sector provides powerful incentives for risk-taking behaviours, recklessness and impunity among operators, with greater risks to the public,” the Crime Research Centre noted.The centre says addressing major challenges in the boda boda motorcycle transport is essential in ensuring a secure, orderly and reliable part of public transport in Kenya."
779,"The good, the bad and the ugly: 2020 in a nutshell","For many people, 2020 has been the worst year of their lives. Annus horribilis, a horrible year.They suffered through the Covid-19 pandemic, a fractured economy, onerous public debt, rising unemployment, ugly politics, corruption scandals and a spike in insecurity. among others.Some also think there's no reason to think it will get much better in 2021.Still, there were some bright moments.Here is a brief look at some of the best and worst moments of the year.Launch of UHC biometric registration President Uhuru on October 31 launched the biometric registration into the Universal Health Coverage program.Even though the benefits have not yet kicked in, the President hopes the digitisation of the health sector will ensure the authentication of patient identification prior to treatment therefore drastically reducing fraud in health insurance.According to Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, the biometric registration will go hand in hand in reducing the cost of maintenance and in turn reduce the cost of treatment in the country.The new improvement into the health care system will enable patients in remote areas to access treatment from doctors across the country.Kenya winning UNSC seatIt won't make much difference to wananchi, but Kenya won the two-year Africa slot on the UN Security Council in June.It means status and recognition, pushing African issues but it has no veto power.On the 15-member council, the Big Five - the US, Britain, China, France and Russia - wield the real power.Kenya defeated Djibouti with 129 votes in a second-round vote after failing to secure the 128 required in the first round. The UN's 192 member states vote.Kenya’s candidature was endorsed by the African Union, though Djibouti contested the endorsement. It replaces South Africa for 2021-22.The council, which handles global peace and security, has 10 non-permanent members and the Big Five.Fighting Covid-19 PandemicCovid-19 dominated the year and left the struggling economy in shambles.It touched everyone in one way or another - including the deaths of loved ones and friends, loss of jobs and income, uncertainty, strict safety rules, required mask wearing that many people, including VIPs, defied. There is the Kemsa procurement scandal, police brutality and corruption in enforcing safety rules and a rise in gender-based violence.It exposed shocking inadequacies in Kenya's healthcare system and neglect of health workers by failing to provide them with proper PPEs.Kenya's first case of the potentially deadly respiratory virus was reported on March 13,  a woman who travelled to Nairobi from the US via London on March 5 On the same day of confirmation, the government came up with strict guidelines and rules, including temporary lockdowns, travel restrictions, orders to stay home when possible, masking, hand washing and sanitising, avoiding crowds, among others.National Co-ordination Committee on the Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic (NCCRCP) lead the government’s efforts in trying to flatten the novel coronavirus curve.And though the situation in Africa is not as horrific as that in the US and Europe, it's still bad.Kenya has recorded 92,055 virus cases with at least 1,593 reported Covid-19 related deaths.As of December 15, 73,452 patients had recovered from the virus.Worldwide, the virus has killed more than 1.5 million people and the numbers rise daily.BBI rallies disruptedIn a blow to politicians, especially those pushing Building Bridges Initiative, public gatherings were banned; churches and mosques were closed, visits to prisons - Covid breeding grounds - were suspended.The pandemic came at a time when the BBI popularizing rallies were intensified with proponents taking campaigns across the country. Kisii, Kakamega, Narok, Mombasa, Kitui, Meru and Nakuru had played host to the rallies while more scheduled regional meetings were suspended.However, regardless of the pandemic, the President, ODM Party leader Raila Odinga were able to launch the report on October 26 at Bomas.Learning paused, teen pregnancies spikeAll schools and educational institutions started closing in mid-March. Suspension of the academic calendar was greeted with mixed reactions; with parents, teachers and learners expressing fear of losses.The seven months out of school had had severe damages to the learners. Cases of rape, kidnap, teenage pregnancies and drug abuse skyrocketed.Kakamega county was one of the badly affected counties having recorded 6,686 adolescent pregnancies between January and May this year.Full school opening is expected in January 2021.Kemsa scandalThe crisis focused attention on  social and economic inequality.The #Covid-19billionaires became a very popular hashtag on social media following reports of alleged theft of funds at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority.The Auditor General said Kenyans lost Sh2.3 billion in Kemsa procurement.The report said Kemsa illegally and irregularly diverted monies meant for UHC to purchase Covid-19 items without approval of the Health ministry.Kemsa spent Sh7.6 billion despite getting approval for Sh758i.6 billion.Dead medicsThis year can easily be marked as the worst year for medical workers. From the numerous deaths of doctors to delay pays to inadequate Personal Protective Equipment for the frontline workers.The fate of patients in the country remains unknown as the standoff between the government and the healthcare workers continues to deepen.The crisis in the health sector went from bad to worse when doctors joined nurses and clinical officers in the industrial action.The doctors have for a long time demanded for better working conditions, medical and insurance cover, hiring of more healthcare workers and provision of quality and adequate personal protective equipment.As of December 21, at least 15 medics had lost their lives with infected.Suffering police brutalityThe fatal shooting of a 13-year-old Yassin Hussein Moyo and the brutal enforcement of the initial 7pm to 5am curfew further exposed police brutality, despite attempted reforms.Yassin was on the family balcony in Huruma, Nairobi, when he was shot apparently by the officers who were enforcing the curfew to curb the spread of the coronavirus.Police had spotted some suspicious youths past curfew and fired indiscriminately, a source told the Star. Yassin was struck.He is one of more than 130 victims of police brutality, ranging from curfew enforcement to other shootings and disappearances.Economy plummetsThe rate of joblessness doubled two months after Kenya reported its first coronavirus in March, rising to 10.4 per cent from 5.2 per cent. It was also higher than the 4.7 per cent in the same quarter of 2019.Unemployment rose to 4,637,164 between April, compared to 2,329,176 same period last year.Many firms closed because of Covid-19, including stay-at-home and travel restrictions. Bars and entertainment venues closed. workers were sent home.The number of people in active employment shrank to 15,870,357 compared to 17,790,800 in the corresponding quarter last year and 17,586,961 in the first three months of the year.Unemployment rose sharply amongst people aged 20 to 29 years.Most jobs were lost in the services sector, followed by industry and agriculture.Loss of income resulted in increased crime.CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge in May said at least 75 per cent small and medium businesses risked closure by end of June due to lack of funds in the wake of Covid-19.This translates to close to eight businesses out of every 10, a situation the CBK governor described as dire and requiring quick interventions for a sector that accounts for 70 per cent of new jobs.Rising public debt, missing revenue targetsOn November 25, Interior CS Fred Matiang'a said low revenue collection, a ballooning debt and the economic challenges of Covid-19 have plunged Kenya into a cash crunch,Increase of budget gaps, resource utilisation and the rising debt has been a source of concern to the country economic experts.Kenya's public debt currently stands at a new high of Sh7 trillion.According to the Institute of Public Finance (IPFK) and the International Budget Partnership Kenya (IBPK), the country's budget continues to experience deficits forcing the government to continue borrowing heavily.Meanwhile, the country continues to channel more funds towards recurrent expenditure with the financial year to October having consumed Sh295.8 billion.Government total development expenditure was at Sh91.8 billion and as of October 30, total revenues for the current financial year was Sh783.8 billion.A total of Sh664.3 billion has been channelled to the national government with counties taking up Sh78.4 billion, the bulk going towards recurrent expenditure.Ruto pushed out2020 saw more troubles dog the Jubilee Party as Deputy President William Ruto and his allies were on the receiving end of the arrow.Ruto has been sidelined in Jubilee with some of his key allies, including former Majority leaders Aden Duale and Kipchumba Murkomen, being kicked out of parliamentary leadership positions.Party members allied to President Uhuru Kenyatta went as far as recommending Ruto be removed as Jubilee deputy leader.Triggered by the opening of the Jubilee Asili Centre, the Kileweke sanction warned that Ruto was no longer welcomed at the party's headquarters.Meanwhile, Ruto has given the clearest indication that he is done with the Jubilee Party and will be seeking a new outfit for 2022.He said he was working to solve the issues facing the party but was ready to consider other options."
780,Rollercoaster of events that happened due to Covid-19,"2020 is one year we will all never forget. The one year you had no option but tpo follow the rules and directives set by the government.Covid-19 hit different countries and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.Coronavirus has killed many, leaving others fighting for their lives in health facilities.It has affected the world in a wide range of ways. It has been a rollercoaster surviving 2020 but the year is almost over.But how did Covid-19 affect Kenyans and what measures were taken?1. CurfewWhen the first case of Covid-19 was reported in Kenya, most people did not take it seriously as many did not even exercise social distancing or wearing of masks.This was until the government gave strict directives. Every Kenyan is supposed to wear a mask, practice social distancing, wash hands with soap and water and also practice sanitizing.This curfew period saw Kenyans rushing up and down to get all the supplies they would need at home because after 7pm, no one was allowed to leave the house and if found outside, you were bound to face the wrath of the authorities  Then came the curfew. In March, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced targeted interventions aimed at cushioning Kenyans from further spread of Covid-19.As a result, Uhuru initially imposed a dusk to dawn curfew that ran from 7 pm to 5 am.Kenyans risked a fine of Sh10,000, three-month imprisonment, or both if arrested by security officers for violating the curfew order.Then came the 9pm-4am curfew set by the president, which saw Kenyans have extra time to get back home safely.Late September, the national curfew was then extended by 60 days by the president. The curfew hours were extended from 11pm to 4am. This move gave Kenyans a few more hours to rush and finish any left errands they might have been undertaking.Well, it was embraced and still is but there are a couple of humans who still think time should have been extended, lol.2. Bars and restaurants Many Kenyans like the bottle and December is usually marked by many drink-filled festivities. However, the government has warned Kenyans to be careful and take the necessary precautions.Last month, Uhuru, in his 13th address to the nation about the virus, said that the country's positivity rate had risen.He directed that all bars and  restaurants to be closed by 9pm, an hour before the new curfew started.At the same time, the president said the curfew hours had been revised to start from 10pm to 4am, and will be observed up to January 3, 2021.  It was a tough time for those who enjoy drinking, because they found it hard to not go for a few beers. 3. Social gatheringsIf 2020 is not the year that made you feel like you have no social life, then you are among the few exceptions.We all know that Kenyans never sleep especially when it comes to the party life; you know, late nights and drowning in alcohol.But coronavirus shifted habits. Part of the directives given by the government was exercising social distancing where by you had to be 1.5 metres away from the other persons, ways meant to curb the spread of the virus.Hugging, kissing or even high fiving were discouraged as a way to avoid the spread of the virus.Parents have had to teach their children to keep their masks on.But what we need to understand is that this is not a punishment, but rather a measure to save our lives.Just wear your mask at all times when you are in public. Protect yourself and those around you. You might be saving someone else's life without knowing.So are you practicing social distancing right now or are you playing around with your health or those of others?4. Opening and closing of schools If you are a parent, you must have felt a pinch when the government announced that children in the fourth grade, eighth grade or in Form Four had to return back to school.It was a decision that caught many parents and guardians off guard.In October, Education CS George Magoha flagged the reopening of schools for Grade Four, Class Eight and Form Four.Parents and guardians had to adjust to the new rules so as to make sure that their children are not left behind.5. TravellingWhen we say this year has been quite crazy and hectic, no one is joking about it.Coronavirus forced the government to lockdown the country. Leaving or entering the country was unaccepted and no flights were coming in or going out of the country.The Nairobi Metropolitan was closed and no one was allowed to enter NMS after curfew hours, which saw people sneak in and out after curfew hours.It has been a crazy year for all of us. We have lost loved ones and we have celebrated after our own recovered from the virus.We are all looking forward to a better 2021, and by God's grace we will emerge victorious after this fight.All in all, let's stay safe, for our own sake. We have nothing to loose by following the directives and measures placed by the government and WHO."
781,How pandemic turned Kenyans' lives upside down in 2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic has forced Kenyans to change their ways and their mindsets in 2020.The pandemic forced changes in long-standing traditions and social norms, like warm greetings, shaking hands, bumping fists, socialising, worshipping together, mourning together, shouting at political rallies.Necessary social distancing - physical distancing is a better term - to curb the virus from spreading has meant people must think first about their own safety and that of others.Wearing masks, washing and sanitising hands, staying indoors and avoiding crowds are alien but necessary concepts.People used to working found themselves jobless. Those who were jobless or underemployed found new ways to earn money.People used to going out were forced to stay indoors.The pandemic really threw a spanner in the works of politicians hell-bent on promoting themselves and BBI.People who fell ill and recovered commented they were forced to think about the meaning of life and realised thee only thing that really mattered was family and human relationships. Covid was the great leveller amongst rich and poor.The pandemic brushed the world the wrong way, killing and leaving souls hurting.When the first case was announced in March, some people were sure the disease would be swiftly contained. Some lost hope in a cure - there is no cure, only treatment. Now some vaccines have been approved.Still, some Kenyans have benefited from new ways of thinking, reflecting, learning online, being by themselves.Marketer Doris Ahenda said that before the pandemic, she couldn't stay indoors, come rain come shine.“No weekend found me indoors. If I was not attending a baby shower somewhere, I was out getting stock orders for my clients or visiting my friends or attending conferences,” she said.“But now we have to deal with the new normal. Staying indoors is now my way of thinking and I'm learning new things on social media.Ahenda says when she has finished working remotely for her office, she learns many skills online.“On YouTube you can learn a few things here and there. Like tutorials on plaiting hair, crocheting, box braiding and retouching dreadlocks,” she said.Doris has also learned how to create posters in a YouTube tutorial.“I would say  the virus impacted me positively. I can now plait others' hair, make posters and even charge for my services,” she added.Ahenda said as long as you take advantage of a situation, you don't need to despair.These are a few things Kenyans have had to change:MOURNINGEver since Covid-19 reached Kenya on March 13, mourning for many communities in western Kenya, particularly the Luo community, was turned on its head.Communal affairs that used to run for days or even weeks were reduced to brief, 15-person events. The same applied to weddings, worship and other gatherings in the new spirit of social distancing.With the new rules in place, we were reduced to mourning our patriarch through grainy photos and amateur online videos that were taken on mobile phones.Grandpa was swiftly laid to rest and we hoped he would have the peace he so desired.COURTSCovid-19 has forced justice to go digital with magistrates and judges  using video links. Sessions are also held outdoors where there's less risk of transmission.One beneficiary is a man accused of stealing a Bible from a supermarket.Following proceedings via a TV screen while in police custody, he was relieved to hear that he will now continue his case as a free person after the judge ordered his release on free bond.It's part of new government efforts to tackle Covid-19 by decongesting prisons, which has already resulted in the release of 4,800 petty offenders. Prisons were, and still are dangerously overcrowded, petri dishes for the coronavirus.Chief Justice David Maraga launched e-filing in which Nairobi courts go digital.Under the new electronic system, all lawyers, police, DPP officers and members of the public are required to register themselves through a portal to log into the Judiciary system.The portal is on https://efiling.court.go.ke.WORKING FROM HOMEMany precautions were put in place by the government - travel restrictions, curfew, partial lockdowns, Virus hot spots were sealed off, travel in and out prevented.Many businesses closed, some people were laid off while others decided to quit over tough working conditions and pay cuts.But the resolve of companies and their resilience did not go down the drain as employers looked for ways to ensure that businesses went on.This meant working from home, a practice not much adopted before Covid-19, but now it's common - among people lucky enough to still have jobs.Our culture's dramatic shift to working from home is the true breakout business story from this pandemic. The increased potential for remote work holds promise because you are positioned to live the lifestyle you want while cutting out a variety of office and commuting costs.However, not all jobs can be done from home and some people must still go to the office to ensure they serve their clients and customers.Data shared by European mobility platform Bolt, which operates in 35 countries, indicates most of their employees, except drivers, refer to work from home. They occasionally visit the office.The survey of 1,000 Bolt employees at the beginning of June indicated  almost 80 per cent would like to work from home at least half of the time or more."
782,Kenyan innovators who wowed the country in 2020,"Kenya found itself in a catch-22 situation during the year 2020, where it had to deal with a number of challenges, the most being the deadly novel coronavirus.The virus pandemic hit the nation at the time when it was still battling the devastating desert locusts that raided farms in many parts of the country, destroying crops across several counties.The government had announced that plans had been put in place to protect its citizens from the virus once it found itself in the country.But when the first case was reported on March 13, 2020, loopholes emerged.As more people tested positive, some needed specialised treatment which required more facilities and equipment, which the government was not adequately prepared for.Indeed, necessity is the mother of invention, a reality that came to pass during the year as the government, private organisations, institutions as well as individuals joined hands in coming up with equipment, ways, and ideas to combat the virus.Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, face masks, gloves, sanitisers among others were equipment key in fighting the virus.Ventilator prototypeThe more seriously affected Covid-19 patients needed the help of ventilators to ensure that lungs are function even as the body fights the virus.In April, a group of 16 students from Kenyatta University developed a ventilator as the country stepped up efforts to combat the virus.They said that each ventilator would cost them Sh500,000 to produce and the university had the capacity to produce 50 units per week.The initiative was a collaboration among students from engineering, nursing, medicine, and pharmacy schools.The ventilator was driven by engineering school dean Dr Shadrack Mambo and Prof Nicholas Gikonyo, who is the chairman of the Chandaria Business Innovation and Incubation Centre, where the project is housed.All the materials used for the prototype were locally sourced.Toyota Kenya also developed a ventilator as an emergency use resuscitator system to support patients with Covid-19 respiratory failure.The ventilator was designed to enable rapid large-scale development and deployment, and it was made from locally sourced components.According to the company, the bridge mechanical ventilator comprises four parts which include a motor vehicle motor 12V DC, which can be sourced from any car wiper motor, locally fabricated sheet metal pattern which can be cut by CNC machines or fabricated by Jua Kali artisans.It also comprised a cam pattern which can also be cut from sheet metal plates to control the tidal volume and a motor control circuit that can be locally made using available IC, transistor, capacitors, and resistors.ICU bedsBy the end of June, the country had reported more than 6,000 positive cases with 148 deaths and the number of patients admitted in hospitals increased.With the rising demand for ICU beds, a group of youths in Githunguri, Kiambu County, made an ICU bed using locally available materials.This came at the time when the president had directed all the 47 county governments to have at least 300-bed capacity facilities. Eric Gathogo, who is the group leader said that they took the step after a discussion with all the group members.“The government directed that counties should have over 300 beds in their hospitals and we thought this was an opportunity since the beds are being imported and we have the ability to make them locally,” Erick said.The group also sought professional advice from an engineer who instructed them on which metal, wood, screws, bolts, and wire mesh to use. The engineer also gave them the schematic to build a standard recommended ICU bed.They were able to be awarded tenders to supply the beds to the various hospitals, Murang'a county leading by contracting them to supply 100 beds.Handwashing machinesOne of the preventive methods to curb the spread of the virus is through proper handwashing.The government asked its citizens to wash their hands using a bar soap with enough running water. This led to the innovation of handwashing machines among Kenyans.In May, an IT degree holder from Murang’a came up with an automatic handwashing machine to help residents fight the coronavirus. James Nyakera, who is from Mioro village in Mathioya, fit an ultrasonic sensor onto a frame on which a water tank is mounted to dispense soap and water.  When you put a hand underneath the outlet pipe, the sensor activates a pump that releases liquid soap for three seconds.His step was followed by a standard six schoolboy who invented a wooden hand the washing machine.A nine-year-old boy Stephine Wamukota, said he came up with the idea and started assembling the required tools, including woods and nails.His father James Wamukota helped him to finalise his project, which attracted the attention of the villagers who benefited from it.The boy was among the list of 68 Kenyans who were honoured with the presidential award for their efforts in fighting the pandemic.Covid contact tracing appThree researchers from Mount Kenya University (MKU) also joined the list of inventors, by developing a Covid-19 contact tracing application named KoviTrace.Donatus Njoroge (a Biochemist and a lecturer at MKU), Gideon Kamau (an IT expert), and Dr. Jesse Gitaka (a medic) said the app has the ability to trace people who might have been in close contact with a patient for the last 14 days.The system, according to Njoroge, has a back-end system, which is a web-controlled portal that can be used by the administrator, in this case, the Ministry of Health, and a front-end system that can be accessed by Kenyans with smartphones or through USSD for those without such phones. “The App keeps track of locations and timestamps in a database, which is the back-end that can only be accessed by the administrator (Ministry of Health),” he said.Garden furnitureThe Jua Kali sector also showcased its capability, by coming up with a bench that can be converted to a table.Stephen Odhiambo and Dennis Otieno, based at Ngong Road are the carpenters behind the viral garden furniture video that caught the attention of Kenyans.The carpenters said that they lifted the idea from the internet and went ahead to practically make it become a reality.They were able to receive a number of demands from Kenyans, a bench ranging from Sh25,000-Sh40,000.Deputy President William Ruto is among the people wowed by their product, inviting them to his residential home in Karen, and made an order."
783,Seven activities for the family this festive season,"Magical Kenya, as our beautiful land in the eastern end of Africa is known by the world, offers so many varieties of experiences and tasteful adventures as well as culturally diverse communities, that cannot be explored in a short amount of time. And yes, 'Magical Kenya' is the main mantra by which tourism buffs and all the world explorers of today refer to our magnificent country under the sun.Since gaining our independence in 1963, we have made significant strides into becoming one of the most recognisable attractions in the east and central region of Africa. This has been brought about by the ever increasing influence of the western world with industries such as tourism, trade, investing and infrastructure development as well as media, music and social economic interactions.All these have raised the knowledge base and general know how of the Kenyan people.One of the results of this knowledge growth is the development of fun outdoor activities that some may partake in with their families or even alone. The advantage we have as Africans is that we have all the natural resources without having to secure them from other continents or countries. This gives us the advantage of maintaining a true and accurate depiction of the wild, while still being able to enjoy the amenities that modernization brings.With that modernisation, comes theme parks, cinema halls, malls, racetracks and so much more. With the ongoing pandemic, outdoor activities and usual tourism (including domestic) has taken a serious hit in the financial perspective, seeing as people do not want to risk contracting the virus for the sake of fun.But for those of us who don't live in fear, there are plenty of things one can partake in to oblige your free spirited nature. or just to get out of your comfort zone and fulfill those items on your bucket list.1. Zip liningThis is the most common activity that most people who prefer traveling to a night out on the town can enjoy, without seriously damaging your pocket or your pants, lol.Various places offer the activity, you just need to do the research. But the more common place that a lot of people have gone and left good reviews is 'The Forest' in Kimende just past Limuru on your way to Naivasha.The adrenaline filled activity can leave you screaming your lungs out as you descend from one platform to the other, tethered to a steel cable by a harness that secures you sometimes as high as 100ft in the air.And the best part, this is an activity that can be undertaken by the whole family. Try it. 2. Swimming with the fishesThere is a place called Wasini at the coast, a short boat ride away from Diani Beach that has amazing price friendly activities such as scuba diving, and dolphin watching.The adrenaline filled activity can leave you screaming your lungs out as you descend from one platform to the other, tethered to a steel cable by a harness that secures you sometimes as high as 100ft in the air.And the best part, this is an activity that can be undertaken by the whole family. Try it.Take the family there for an unforgettable week(end) during this festive season and be adorned by the love that nature affords freely in the interactions we have with gentle creatures such as the dolphins.  If you're lucky enough, you can even get to see the humpback whales, which visit every so often per year and are a rare yet spectacular event to witness.3. Bungee Jumping For the more hardcore adrenaline junkies, this is the activity for you and your crew of mates. There are six places that offer the brilliant service but the more common site is the one in Sagana.Rapids Camp in Sagana has a 4.5 rating of excellence on google and once you go jump off a bridge as you plummet at terminal velocity towards river Tana, you will understand why. One must however possess the nerves of steel to participate in this wonderful activity. 4. White water raftingSagana again takes the cake on this one, simply because the river offers so many different spots to which adrenaline fuelled activities flourish.Strap yourself into a dinghy with a few friends and try to navigate the rushing water of River Tana without tipping over or getting stuck in a whirlpool. This fun activity can sometimes be dangerous so be cautious and weary of the company you decide to travel with. 5. PaintballingThis is the best activity because not only does it get your heart rate up but it also engages your mind because you have to create strategies that can be employed to defeat the opposing team. (My apologies if I might sound like a gamer on this one).This activity however is best enjoyed with a large group of individuals or families, since they will be pitted against each other, in the battle for supremacy.But once the games begin, it's all up to you to shoot paintballs at your opponents. But not to worry. Every individual is given protective gear.6. Game drives and nature trailsFor the more conservative and low risk activities in our great land of Kenya are the National Parks and Conservancies or reserves. There is a wide range of wild natural habitats that can be explored in the whole country and the most famous one is Maasai Mara.There you can see lions, elephants, leopards, cheetahs etc, and if you're lucky enough, you might even get to catch a live action hunt. The best time to view animals is at dawn or dusk due to high temps during the day (depending on the season).7. SkydivingThe most adrenaline filled activity involves cramming yourself into a small Cessna, climbing up to an altitude of about 12000 feet and jumping out. In Diani, Kenya there is an even bigger edge. If you can afford it, there are people who can take it a notch higher with the ability to jump from 22,000 feet, with a soft landing on the beach.Despite what is going on in the world, there's a lot you can do to get your mind off how hectic the year has been.As they always say, You Only Leave Once. Embrace every bit of it."
784,Floating bridge: Likoni residents' Christmas 'gift' from State,"Likoni residents for the first time got a feel of the Floating Pedestrian Bridge on Christmas Day.The bridge was opened to the public for about six hours from 8am on Friday.Coast regional coordinator John Elungata said the opening of the bridge was to enable the Likoni residents to feel what the government has done for them.""We are also testing the social distance principle,"" said Elungata.The residents welcomed the bridge saying it will decongest the Likoni ferry crossing channel.""We are tired of the Likoni ferry crossing channel. The waiting, the mishaps, the push and pull, it is all depressing,"" said Mariam Mohammed, a resident of Bofu in Likoni.Mohammed, however, said the long distance from the Island side to the mainland side should have a shed.""When it rains and when the sun is too hot, we will be suffering,"" said Mohammed.Bikia Gulimo, a Migombani resident in Bofu, said the bridge will open up their small scale businesses.""We are happy because of the bridge. Although it is too long, it will make us exercise,"" said Gulimo.The bridge is 824m long.Elungata said after 2pm Friday, the bridge will be closed again until January 1 when it will be opened officially to the public.However, Elungata said, from January 1, the bridge will be operating daily but only during the day.""We are developing the Standard Operating Procedures for the bridge. It will be opened at around 4am and be closed to the public at night, depending on the time we will set in the Standard Operating Procedures,"" said Elungata.KPA acting MD Rashid Salim said maritime stakeholders have already been informed about the possible operating procedures.""Shipping lines and agents have been informed because the ships will be critical to this bridge,"" said Salim.He said the opening and closing schedule of the bridge will have to be in synergy with the ships.Elungata said matatu termini will be established at both the Islands and mainland sides of the bridge.""These will only be drop-off points. No stopping,"" said the RC.He said a multi-agency police unit will be deployed at the bridge to ensure the safety of pedestrians crossing."
785,"How confusion, fear engulfed Kenya as virus struck","The first case of novel coronavirus was reported in China, back in December 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei province.Spreading like a wild-fire, the virus reached Europe and the US through travellers returning from hotspots in Asia.The Kenyan government, fully aware of the disease said that it has put in place enough mechanisms to protect its citizens from the deadly virus.The deadly virus, which wreaked havoc on the population as well as the economy and impacted the social lives of communities across the globe caused panic in Africa.The virus landed in Africa on February 14, 2020; the first case being reported in Egypt.Kenya confirmed its first case of the disease on March 13, 2020, causing fear across the country.The case was reported from a 27-year-old Kenyan woman who had travelled from the US via London.Later on, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a raft of measures to mitigate the further spread of the virus, including restrictions on travel from any countries with any case of the virus.He also gave an order that saw all the schools and learning institutions in the country closed by March 20.""All schools and higher learning institutions be closed by Friday, March 20, 2020. Government and business people start working from home; except essential services,” Uhuru announced.Kenyans received the news in shock, the majority rushing into the supermarkets to stock up in fear of a possible lockdown.Commodities such as sanitizer, masks as well as toilet papers were cleared from shelves even after prices tripled.Naivas Supermarket along Kenyatta Avenue depleted its stock of sanitiser the next morning. Items such as tissue papers, maize flour, milk, and sugar were other household goods bought in bulk.The retail outlets had to put in place limited purchase policies for some items such as hand sanitiser and antiseptics to ensure no customer is deprived of disinfectants.For instance, an individual had to purchase only two sanitiser items at a go at Carrefour Supermarket in Sarit Centre, Westlands.Kenyans learned about the idea of stocking toilet papers from Western countries, after a video in an Australian supermarket surfaced showing three women pulling each other’s hair and screaming over a large pack of toilet rolls. This was also perpetrated by social media through videos and pictures of people shopping in supermarkets.Earlier, the majority of Africans believed in unconfirmed misconception about the virus, some saying that the virus does not survive in the body of an African man.Some of the people who believed that drinking alcohol, such as beer, liquor, and wine prevent the spread of coronavirus had to stock it, a belief that was dismissed by the World Health Organisation.The fear of a possible lockdown also forced Kenyans to stock different items, clearing essential items from the shelves.In March, a global think tank GeoPoll released its findings regarding Kenyans preparedness and the response to the virus.The research was conducted between March 10 and 13, focusing on knowledge and perceptions towards the virus in South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria.It revealed that 94 per cent were aware of the pandemic, noting that there were high levels of uncertainty in Kenya with 27 per cent stating that they were not sure and 12 per cent believing there had been confirmed cases.“Despite relatively low numbers of cases in each country, concern over coronavirus is high. We found that 71 per cent in Kenya, 69 per cent in Nigeria, and 72 per cent in South Africa rated their level of concern as ‘very high,'” the report said.About 25 per cent reported many items being out of stock while 40 per cent said some items have run out of stock since the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the fear and misconceptions among Kenyans about the virus, its spread was fast enough that all the 47 counties had reported cases of the virus by August.The president announced a raft of measures in March to curb the further spread of the virus, which included the closure of all the learning institutions in the country.Other measures included directing government and businesses people to start working from home; except essential services, cashless transactions over cash, avoiding congressional meetings such as weddings, malls, night clubs, churches, limitation of visits to hospitals.By April, the number of positive cases as well as the number of deaths increased, despite the measures introduced.The president declared the cessation of movement in and out of Nairobi, Kilifi, Kwale, and Mombasa counties for 21 days.The four counties were the hotspot for the transmission of the virus.Uhuru said that majority of people who had contracted the disease were from Nairobi, Kilifi, Kwale, and Mombasa counties.The virus is still spreading daily across the world and healthcare workers who are at the front row in fighting the virus burning the midnight oil to save lives.As of December 11, 2020, Kenya had more than 90,000 positive cases of the virus out of about 960,000 cumulative tests.The virus has so far claimed more than 1,560 lives.Kenyans and the entire world have grasped to a glimmer of hope and crossed their fingers that the development of Covid-19 vaccines and further progress about it succeeds.WHO had said in April that there were 62 different coronavirus vaccine candidates that had been developed across the world.Some have so far reported the progress of the vaccines, with Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine being rolled out in the UK for use.Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old woman became the first person in the world to be given the Covid jab in the UK.According to the Ministry of Health, Kenya is among the countries that are in the race to acquire the vaccine.Recently, Health CAS Rashid Aman said that there are 40 patients undergoing the AstraZeneca first phase trial in the country, and more patients are expected to participate in the trial.AstraZeneca vaccine is among the three vaccines that are in the race to prove its efficacy to the virus, which Kenya is taking part in.“We are looking at the possibility of getting any of these vaccines once they become available and tested. The interim results do indicate the levels of safety and effectiveness of these.”"
786,[EXPLAINER] New coronavirus variant in South Africa: Are concerns justified?,"South Africa has identified a new variant of the novel coronavirus, which authorities believe is driving a surge in COVID-19 infections that could overwhelm its healthcare system.Several countries, including Britain which has found the mutant variant in cases linked to South Africa, have banned flights from South Africa, disrupting holiday travel and frustrating tour operators.WHAT IS THE NEW VARIANT?The new variant, referred to as 501.V2, was discovered by a network of scientists around South Africa who have been tracking the genetics of the SARS-COV-2 virus.The variant appears to be focused in the south and southeast regions of the country and has been dominating findings from samples collected since October, they say.First identified in Nelson Mandela Bay, along South Africa's east coast, it spread rapidly to other districts in the Eastern Cape, and to the Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal (KZN) provinces.Scientists say the variant is different from others circulating in South Africa because it has multiple mutations in the important ""spike"" protein that the virus uses to infect human cells.It has also been associated with a higher viral load, meaning a higher concentration of virus particles in patients' bodies, possibly contributing to higher levels of transmission.Between 80% and 90% of new cases in the country are carrying the mutant variant, according to health authorities.ARE THE CONCERNS JUSTIFIED?All viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, change over time, and there have been hundreds of variations of this virus identified worldwide.South African scientists say there is no clear evidence at this stage that this variant is associated with more severe disease or worse outcomes. However, it does appear to spread faster than previous iterations.""What has happened with the sheer number of infections growing very fast is that's overwhelmed really fast the health care system,"" said Professor Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KZN Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), who helped conduct genome sequencing on South Africa’s mutant variant. ""And when that happens, we have a big spike of increased mortality.""The positivity rate - or the percentage of all coronavirus tests performed that are actually positive - stood at 26% as of Dec. 23, around double the average rate of infection before December, when the virus showed signs of waning.In the first wave of infections, which peaked during the winter months between June and July, the positivity rate reached as high as 27%.""The rate of spread is much faster than the first wave and we will surpass the peak of the first wave in the coming days,"" health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday.IS IT DIFFERENT TO THE UK VARIANT?The variants reported by South Africa and the UK share a common change in the spike protein that may make them more infectious. But they are different variants, and sequence analysis revealed that they originated separately, the World Health Organization said.Dr Andrew Preston, reader in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath, said, ""The 'South African' variant is distinct from the UK variant, but both contain an unusually high number of mutations compared to other SARS-CoV-2 lineages.""WILL COVID-19 VACCINES PROTECT AGAINST THIS VARIANT?South African authorities say it is too early to say whether the vaccines currently being deployed in Britain and the United States or other COVID-19 shots in development, will protect against the new variant.Vaccine developers including AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Moderna Inc said this week that they expect their shots to still work against the UK variant."
787,Painful Christmas for Malindi businessman beaten by police,"A businessman in Malindi will not celebrate Christmas this year after he was beaten up by police and suffered a fractured hand for allegedly being found outside during curfew hours.Zackayo Kaibunga popularly known as Zack was on his way home at around 10.30pm when he was assaulted by the police officers for allegedly faulting curfew rules.Kaibunga also claimed that the police officers also allegedly stole Sh105,000 that he had withdrawn to go and pay workers at his site.Trouble started after the businessman who was driving home was stopped by police officers and after interrogation, they began assaulting him dragged him into a Landcruiser where his hand sustained multiple fractures.Journalists met Kaibunga at the Meridian hospital in Malindi town after he had been treated and disclosed that he tried to plead with the officers to allow him to drive himself to the police station in vain.In an interview, Kaibunga said he called the OCS and informed him that he had been arrested by his deputy and did not want to allow him to drive himself to the Police station.""Immediately after making that call they roughed me upholding my waist and dragged me towards the Police land cruiser, I took my phone and kept it inside the pocket,"" he said.He said the officers dragged him to the door of the land cruiser and as they lifted him his hand twisted and despite shouting in pain the officers dragged him into their vehicle.To make matters worse he said the police officers forced him to sit down and stepped him on his waist without caring that he had been injured.""A female police officer who was in the team informed the deputy OCS that I had been injured, they drove with me leaving my vehicle open with its engine running and lights on,"" he said.Kaibunga said inside there were three other people who had been arrested and he refused to alight from the vehicle to go to the cells until they took him for treatment.He said they went to the Malindi Sub-county hospital but could not get treatment due to the strike forcing them to go to Tawfiq private hospital.After X-ray examinations and initial treatment, he was found to have a fracture and the police who were still with him took him to the police station since he was under arrest.They later released him on a free bond. Kaibunga underwent surgery and was inserted two metal rods to support his fractured hand at the Meridian hospital and the hospital expenses have so far reached Sh150,000.""I have been trying to follow up my money from the police station in vain, they said they were not aware of it,"" he said.Attempts to get a comment from Malindi Sub County Police Commander Joe Lekuta did not bear fruits as he did not pick calls or respond to messages regarding the incident.Phillip Matara a Malindi activist condemned the police brutality and wondered why police could not just arrest him and take him to the police before charging him in a court of law.He said a similar incident occurred in Kisii and a very young soul was lost due to police brutality.''We want to request ur police officers, ur government agencies please let us be human to let the law take its course, people should be arrested, taken to the police station and the court to face charges as per the law,'' he said.Matara said Malindi was a tourist destination and should not be spoilt by few rogue police officers who do not respect human rights."
788,Tantalising foods to treat your family to this festive season,"Another year, another festive season, the one season millions across the world look forward to.Christmas time is one of the special times in the year when we get to spend time with family and friends, exchange gifts, eat lots of food, and look back at how the year was.However, this year it is quite different for everyone. The world is battling a pandemic ever since the first case of Coronavirus was reported December 2019, in Wuhan, China.  It has been a challenging year for many because we have all had to adjust to the new normal; wear a mask whenever you go out, maintain social distancing and always sanitize or wash your hands before you eat or touch your mouth, eyes or ears.These are directives we have to live by, instructed by the government to curb the spread of the virus.Christmas in 2020 is going to be different compared to other years where you would host a large group of family and friends and all this is because of Covid-19.So many restrictions have been placed and even for concert lovers, it's not an option attending any concert at the moment. There are rules we need to follow but at the same time, it does not mean that your festive season should be boring or rather should be like the years that passed.You can try new things and since food is always involved when it comes to the festive season, why don't you try incorporating different meals in your menu.Food is always something we all look forward to indulging in, so many trying out different meals might make the festivities a bit lively.  1. LasagnaThis is a meal not many people are familiar with, well unless you are a foodie.But it is a meal you can surprise your family with this season. If you are a cheese lover, then this meal will be perfect this season.Lasagna is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of thin flat pasta alternating with fillings such as ragù and other vegetables, cheese, and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil. If you have an oven, then you can easily prepare this meal. 2. PilauNow, this is one meal we all love in Kenya. Pilau is a coastal cuisine that has spread across different tribes, with many creating different ways of making it.Consisting of rice, meat and different herbs, this meal is prepped in almost all occasions be it a wedding, birthday party, graduation party, you name; you'll never miss this delicious meal.Some say it's the icing on the cake in every occasion but some people might differ.Pilau has always been a go to meal for most households as it is not too much of a hustle to prepare.During the festive season, pilau is bound to be part of the menu in many households.Try and make it differently. Add something that your family will find unique like playing around with the ingredients to accommodate everyone.3. MahamriThis is another coastal meal that most of us have fallen in love with over the years. Made from flour, mixed with butter or margarine, sugar, some essence and other ingredients, this Mahamri are the go to snack or late night meal you would want to go for this festive season.Most households cook together during Christmas and Mahamris can be a substitute from the usual mandazis you've had the whole year.They can also be eaten with mbaazi (pigeon peas) cooked in coconut sauce. Mbaazi wa nazi is a delicious meal mostly eaten with mahamri or rice, depending on your preference.4. MukimoMukimo is a traditional meal that originated from central Kenya but overtime it found its way to different regions.It's a mixture of boiled potatoes, soft maize or corn, peas, some seasoning and butter, which is optional.Mashed together, it brings out this really beautiful meal that can be served with beef/chicken stew with vegetables of your choice.To add colour and flavour some people add cream spinach and dhania to also give it some unique taste.5. Beef/Chicken curryNow we all know a feast is not complete without some stew or curry to go with the chapatis and rice.Most households just do the usual; boil meat, add onions and tomatoes, then potatoes and all the seasonings one can get.But a curry can be exciting to make and also indulge in.Incooperate different ways to make your curry or stew. Add some flavour and garnishes in the stew and let your have a different experience, surprise their taste buds with something new. Let's say a bit thick, lol (if you know, you know).6. ChapatisIf you have attended any Kenyan event and chapatis were not in the menu, then you'd probably think the event is a scam. Chapati should be a staple food if it's not considered one yet.In every occasion yo attend, chapati is always available and these meal has been embraced for years.There are people who say its quite a hustle to make them bad boys but its actually not that had.You just have to make sure you make your dough a few hours before you start prepping the rolls.That way, it makes it easier to cook the chapatis and they'll turn out soft and yummy.For dessert, let's try out some lemon, carrot or fruit cake. We can step away from the usual chocolate and vanilla flavoured cakes for a minute because we have really overdone them.Also, don't let anyone  stop you from indulging in your favourite flavoured cake, but it would be great if you tried other flavours. Just make sure you are not allergic to any of the new options you'll choose.As for drinks, it's pretty clear that its #drinkcember , something social media fanatics use every December.If you are a drink lover, try different cocktails, something you've never tried before and see if you like it. If you are a gin and tonic kinda person, try the whisky on the rocks.Furthermore, its the end of the year and we have survived Covid-19.Celebrate life this festive season because it has been a hectic year, but at the same time, please stay safe. Exercise all the measures put in place and let's look forward to seeing each other next year.Happy holidays everyone."
789,Covid-19: The uninvited guest that brought the world to a standstill,"On March 13, Kenya reported its first Covid-19 case after a 27-year-old woman who travelled from the US via London tested positive.The government moved swiftly to identify and isolate a number of people who had come into contact with the first case.On March 15, Cabinet Secretary for Health, Mutahi Kagwe, announced that two people who had sat next to the initial patient on the aircraft in transit from the United States had also tested positive for the virus.On the same day, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a raft of measures that were aimed at preventing the further spread of the disease.They included the closure of all learning intuitions, restriction of travel from any countries with any case of Coronavirus, work from home policy for public servants and business people, banning of public gatherings among others.Nine months later, Kenya is still among countries across the world battling with the second wave of the deadly disease.Coronavirus disease well known as Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus strain.It can affect breathing systems like lungs and airways and spreads from person to person through germs that end up on the hands and on surfaces when infected persons are coughing or sneezing.Many people recover after experiencing a period of sickness lasting between 1 – 2 weeks, but some people are at higher risk and may get seriously ill from COVID 19 coronavirus.The disease affects people differently with the majority of those infected developing mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalisation.It is associated with fever, dry cough and tiredness.The less common symptoms include aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on the skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes.HOW IT SPREADSThe virus that causes Covid-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has Covid-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.PEOPLE AT RISKAccording to Kenya’s Ministry of Health, those aged above 70 years are at more risk of contracting the disease.Those with underlying health conditions like cancer, asthma, diabetes, heart diseases, HIV/AIDS or on medication that weakens immune system are also at high risk of infection.INVESTIGATIONEarly cases of Covid-19 were linked to a meat market in Wuhan, China, but investigations have not found samples of the coronavirus in carcasses.WHO is currently conducting an investigation into the origins of the pandemic.The organisation said the investigation will start in Wuhan, the city where the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first identified before expanding to the rest of China and beyond its borders.An international team of epidemiologists, virologists and researchers with expertise in public health, animal health and food safety will lead the WHO’s Covid-19 investigation.Though most researchers have argued the virus originated in bats, how it jumped to humans still remains a mystery.The major task for investigation teams however is crippled with the current political situation between China and the United States. US President Donald Trump has been “calling it a China virus and the Chinese government has been trying to do everything to prove that it is not a China virus.As a result of the political game, crucial details about research underway in China have not been made public.Huanan meat and animal market in Wuhan which many of the earliest people diagnosed with Covid-19 had visited is the main focus for the investigations.Though early investigations sampled frozen animal carcasses at the market found no evidence of the virus, environmental samples taken mostly from drains and sewage tested positive.Many of the initial patients were stall owners, market employees, or regular visitors to this market.WHO teams are expected to investigate the wild and farmed animals sold at the market, including foxes, raccoons (Procyon lotor) and sika deer (Cervus nippon).They will also investigate other markets in Wuhan, and trace the animals’ journeys through China and across borders.The investigators will prioritize animals that are known to be susceptible to the virus, such as cats and mink.THE SITUATIONMany families across the globe have been left in agony after losing their loved ones to the disease.To make it worse, many were denied a chance for closure and burial of their relatives after governments placed tight burial protocols.Currently, the disease has left over 68. 165 million people infected across 220 countries in the world with over 43.2 million having recovered and over 1. 557 million others dead.In Kenya as of December 10, some 90,305 cases had been confirmed with 1,568 deaths and 71,254 recoveries.Total cumulative tests stood at 952,134.As of June 26, some 456 foreigners had contracted the disease in the country.The number of those who have contracted and those who have succumbed of late remains unknown as the ministry did not respond to numerous calls or text messages.As at early December over 2,207 health care workers have also contracted the disease.Over 40 others have succumbed including 13 doctors, 28 nurses and 9 clinicians.Doctors Stephen Mogusu, Robert Ayisi, Doreen Adisa, Said Omar, Ndambuki Mboloi, Faith Kanjiru, Jackline Njoroge, Daniel Alushala, Hudson Inyangala, Vladimir Schuckin, Emaram Ashraf, Ajo Were and Adisa Lugalika are among those who have succumbed.The late Samuel Karanja, Mohamed Hatimy, Peter Chomba, Cyrus Mbembe, Kennedy Mainya and former Hells Gate Ward MCA John Njenga are among politicians who have not been spared by the disease.The disease has had an adverse impact on Kenya’s economy with over 1.72 million people losing their jobs by June when the country imposed coronavirus-induced lockdown that led to layoffs and pay cuts.According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, the number of people in employment fell to 15.87 million between April and the end of June compared to 17.59 million in the previous quarter.Young people were the hardest hit by job cuts compared to their counterparts aged above 35 years in an economic setting that is plagued by a hiring freeze on the back of sluggish corporate earnings.According to the data, this is a major blow to jobseekers, especially the close to one million young people who graduate from various educational institutions every year.The Federation of Kenya Employers with membership from 1,900 companies said 80 per cent of job opportunities that had been secured between 2015 and 2019 had been lost. “We cannot ascertain for how long this damage will last. We need to be prepared to manage businesses within the Covid- 19 environment,” executive director Jacqueline Mugo said.She said since it is projected by January 2021 over 2 million jobs would have been lost, businesses must quickly adapt to the new normal and come up with strategies for survival.Some of the worst-hit sectors include tourism, transport, hospitality, and education.GOVERNMENT RESPONSEOn March 25, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced nation-wide dusk to dawn curfew from 7 pm to 5 am.The head of State also unveiled measures to buffer Kenyans against financial hardships arising movement restrictions associated with the coronavirus crisis.This included 100% tax relief to Kenyans earning Sh24,000 and below, pay as you earn (PAYE) reduction from a maximum of 30 to 25 per cent.Other measures were the reduction of the turnover tax rate from three per to one per cent for all micro, small and medium enterprises, reduction of resident income tax to 25 per cent, making available Sh10 billion to vulnerable groups including the elderly and orphans, among others.Uhuru also temporarily suspended the listing of loan defaulters for of any person, micro, small and medium enterprise and corporate entities whose loan account was in arrears effective April 1, 2020.He announced the reduction of VAT from 16 to 14 per cent effective April 1, 2020.The government also moved to increase the allocation of funds for health care, along with other fiscal adjustments to the economy.About Sh1 billion from the Universal Health Coverage kitty was channelled to the employment of new health workers to help combat the spread of Covid-19.Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto took an 80 per cent pay-cut, all Cabinet Secretaries and Chief Administrative secretaries took a 30 per cent pay-cut and Principal Secretaries took a 20 per cent cut.According to the directive, all state and public officers aged 50 and above with pre-existing medical conditions were directed to take leave or work from home."
790,Impeachment: A fair process or a political weapon?,"Jubilee governors top the list of county chiefs who have been impeached since 2013, sparking concerns the process has been weaponised.Governors backing the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga enjoy a latitude of protection while a number seen to be allied to Deputy President William Ruto have become targets. Since the advent of devolution in 2013, eight governors have been impeached by their county assemblies, including seven from the ruling Jubilee Party and one from Wiper.Of the eight cases that proceeded to full hearing by the Senate, three impeachments have been upheld: Those of Martin Wambora (Embu), Ferdinand Waititu (Kiambu) and Mike Sonko (Nairobi).After impeachment by county assemblies, the Senate or a Senate committee hears both sides in a trial. It is supposed to be neutral, unbiased, impartial and fair.Waititu and Sonko — both close to DP Ruto — are said to be the victims of the politics surrounding the Building Bridges Initiative process, 2022 succession and financial deals in the counties influenced by powerful individuals.For instance, in the case of Sonko, who was impeached on December 17, it is understood his refusal to bow to the state and sign the budget allocation to the Nairobi Metropolitan Services caused him the trouble.The budget allocated NMS, which is domiciled in the Office of the President, Sh27.1 billion of the  total Sh37 billion. Critics allege much of the NMS share was for powerful people doing business with the agency that now runs Nairobi.Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr said there is a clear pattern of a political witch-hunt in some  cases.The senator said the falling out between Uhuru and Ruto could be at play in some cases.  “There is a mismatch. The Jubilee Party is in shambles, hence, the internal rivalry. Nasa may have issues but the MCAs have not resorted [to impeachment] in rancour and bile as we see in Jubilee,” he told the Star in an interview. Wambora was the first to taste the wrath of Embu MCAs in 2014. They impeached him for allegedly violating the County Governments Act by appointing public servants without assembly approval. They also said he improperly purchased Sh35 million maize seeds and illegally procured vehicles, among other things.Senators backed the removal but Wambora, who has been called the governor with nine lives, survived after a court quashed the impeachment.He faced four impeachment attempts in his first term.In 2017, Wambora clinched the Jubilee ticket and retained his seat after defeating his main competitor, former Senator Lenny Kivuti.No sooner had the dust on Wambora's impeachment than Kericho MCAs followed suit to remove Governor Paul Chepkwony.Thirty-two MCAs sanctioned the motion to remove him on grounds he abused his office and oversaw unlawful procurement of goods and services.The former Moi University lecturer was also accused of violating recruitment procedures and failing to follow due process in public-private partnerships.However, a Senate committee hearing the charges found them to be unsubstantiated.And in 2015, Murang'a Governor Mwangi wa Iria was kicked out by 35 MCAs who accused him of failing to manage county debts, misusing cash, gross misconduct and abuse of office, among other failings.But as with his Kericho counterpart, senators saved him. They said the charges against did not meet the constitutional threshold for impeachment.In September 2019, Nyeri county MCAs voted to impeached Governor Nderitu Gachagua, now deceased. The Senate again rejected the charges, holding they did not meet the  threshold set out in the Constitution and the County Governments Act. In 2018, senators saved  Governor Graton Samboja after he was impeached by  Taita Taveta MCAs.A committee chaired by Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga found the charges against the first-term Wiper governor did not meet the threshold for removal.In January this year, however, senators upheld the impeachment of Waititu.Waititu, a close ally of the Deputy President, was accused of gross violation of the Constitution, the County Governments Act, 2012, the Public Finance Management Act, 2012 and the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, 2005.Insiders say, however, Waititu was impeached for vigorously campaigning for the DP in Mt Kenya and impeding the business interests of powerful people.Governors seen to be pro-handshake and pro-BBI referendum to amend the Constitution seem to enjoy political protection.In June this year, Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru survived an impeachment motion after a Senate committee dismissed a motion to remove her on grounds of gross misconduct and abuse of office.The senators said, however, an investigation was warranted into a suspicious 'web' involving tendering.Kirinyaga MCAs accused Waiguru — a key pro-BBI leader in Mt Kenya region — of undermining their authority. They also accused her of gross violation of the Constitution, gross misconduct and abuse of office.The Senate committee chaired by Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala cleared the former Devolution CS who resigned at the height of the NYS scandal, citing ill health.An attempt to impeach Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu failed to take off in June, despite 40 out of 56 MCAs signing the impeachment motion.Migori MCAs, under pressure from top ODM officials, have made several attempts to impeach Governor Okoth Obado but they consistently ran into obstacles.Kericho speaker Dominic Rono said while the impeachment process has been provided for in the law, it has been abused for political ends.“If you study carefully, in this time of the handshake, you will see a trend whereby certain governors are the main targets. Political conspirators are using impeachment as a political weapon against those who do not dance to their songs,” he said.Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei said the Jubilee administration has resorted to impeachment as a means of settling political scores.He questioned why only a majority of governors elected on the Jubilee Party ticket are being impeached.“The Jubilee Party leader, who is President Uhuru Kenyatta, has become vindictive and intolerant against party members including governors. Remember, he dewhipped most members from House committees and gave those positions to the Opposition,” he told the Star.He added, “The imminent collapse of Jubilee has made everything worse. Impeachment is more political persecution."""
791,[PHOTOS] Uhuru lights up Nairobi's iconic fig tree for Christmas,"President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday evening presided over the annual lighting of the Christmas tree in Kenya's capital Nairobi.Unlike previous years where the occasion has been held at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre, the event happened around a tree that stroked controversy in 2020.The century-old fig tree along Waiyaki Way dominated the news following earlier plans to uproot it to make way for the Nairobi-Nakuru expressway.The move drew protests from Kenyans leading to the Nairobi Metropolitan Services declaration that it would not be removed.On Thursday, the President issued a decree declaring the tree a beacon of environmental conservation in Nairobi and around the country.The President said that the iconic tree has been adopted by the NMS and is being conserved as a beacon of Kenya's cultural and ecological heritage.Uhuru assured of Government's commitment to restore Nairobi's lost glory as the 'Green City in the Sun'.The President said the iconic tree, which is estimated to be between 125 to 150 years, links Kenyans with the country's past, present and future.“There can be no greater significant symbol of that commitment than our presence here in front of this fig tree that was here long before Nairobi ever was.""A clear indication that it is possible for us to live with nature, it is possible for us to preserve and conserve, while at the same time develop our infrastructure rapidly and our capacity to ensure that our citizens live decent clean lives that each and every person is entitled to,” he said.The President said through the various environmental conservation projects being rolled out across the city, Nairobi was on course to reclaiming its 'Green City in the Sun' status.Speaking during the unveiling ceremony, a reminiscent President Kenyatta said by conserving the tree, Kenya was reaffirming her commitment to the nation's cultural values of coexistence, peace and unity.“We are here today on the eve of Christmas to celebrate, I believe our past, our present and our hopes for the future.""Indeed we had this recognition world over of the 'green city in the sun' but unfortunately, over the years we abandoned it and we are here to reaffirm and to declare our commitment as a country and as a people to our environment,"" the President said.He said the various environmental restoration projects being undertaken by the Government in Nairobi are aimed at making the city more attractive and improving the quality of life for its residents.The Head of State said the ongoing construction of the JKIA to Kikuyu expressway, which will be ready next year, is aimed at easing traffic congestion in Nairobi, adding that by preserving the fig tree, the country is demonstrating the possibilities of actualizing development while at the same time preserving the environment.NMS Director General Major General Mohammed Badi, who also spoke at the ceremony, said the iconic tree symbolizes hope and the good of the world and called on Kenyans to back Government's development agenda.“To the residents of Nairobi and all Kenyans, let us support Government agencies in their development endeavours by shining our spirit of patriotism and standing the test of time just like this iconic fig tree, a symbol of natures ability to withstand the test of time,"" Badi said."
792,Uhuru asks Africa CDC to issue harmonised Covid protocols for AU meetings,"President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) to prepare harmonised Covid-19 protocols that will ensure participants are safe during the African Union meetings scheduled for February next year.The President emphasized that the protocols will determine whether the AU meetings will be virtual or physical given the challenges occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic.“The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention should give protocols that they think will ensure participants are safe and that will determine whether we will have virtual or physical meetings,” Uhuru said.Uhuru spoke on Thursday evening during a virtual meeting of the Bureau of the Assembly of the AU Heads of State and Government and chairpersons of the Regional Economic Communities (RECs).The meeting was convened by President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, who is also the Chairperson of the AU, to discuss the modalities of holding the 34th Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly, the 38th Ordinary Session of the Executive Council and the 41st Ordinary Session of the Permanent Representatives Committee of the AU.Presidents Abdel Fattah al Sisi (Egypt), Felix Tshisekedi (DRC), Filipe Nyusi (Mozambique), Paul Kagame (Rwanda) and Nana Akufor-Addo (Ghana) attended the virtual meeting among other leaders.During the meeting, the African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat gave an outline of the AU meetings scheduled for next year that will also see the election of a new AUC leadership.Africa CDC Director Dr John Nkengasong briefed the meeting on the status of the pandemic on the continent.He recommended measures to prevent the spread of the disease during the AU meetings including limiting the meeting to one day, testing of delegates in the country of origin and on arrival as well as ensuring that the delegates strictly adhere to the Covid-19 protocols."
793,Ngilu condemns act where man allegedly burnt family to death,"Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has condemned the act where a Mwingi man allegedly set on fire his house where his wife, together with his two children died following the incident.Ngilu, who had visited the family members on Thursday, condoled with the family assuring them of support to cater for the burial expenses.“This incident is very saddening where a whole household has been wiped out and the county government will support the family and the only daughter who has been left alone,” said Ngilu.She also urged locals to seek counseling whenever they undergo hard situations to avoid such horrific incidences.“Let people confide in church leaders and other counselors to avoid such terrifying incidences as even taking lives of innocent children is very disturbing,” added Ngilu.On the fateful day two days ago, Paul Mwai who according to neighbors had been having domestic wrangles with the wife, set his house on fire which was locked from inside.His 42-year-old wife and two children died on the spot while Mwai died this morning while receiving treatment at Mwingi level 4 hospital according to Mwingi Central Deputy Sub-county police commander, Nicholas Mutua.Family wrangles have been sighted as the possible cause of the mysterious fire in a suspected suicide.According to eyewitnesses, the mysterious fire broke down around midnight, and neighbors were woken up by wailing in the house which had already caught fire and upon rushing to the scene they only managed to save the husband before the house caved in.The incident was confirmed by Kavuvwani location Chief Mwinzi Muvengei, also urging residents to remain calm as investigations to unravel the cause of the fire are underway. Bodies of the three were moved to Mwingi Level IV hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem to determine the actual causes of their deaths."
794,Nurses still on strike! Panyako says as he hits out at doctors,"The nurses have vowed to continue with their strike until all their grievances are addressed.The Kenya National Union of Nurses SG Seth Panyako on Thursday said the Return To Work Formula between the doctors’ union and the government does not affect the nurses.He hit out at the Health CS Mutahi Kagwe for sideling the nurses, adding that the CS has had numerous meetings with the doctors union but has never showed up during the conciliatory meetings with nurses and clinical officers, adding that the government has since pulled out of the talks.The doctors called off their strike on Thursday after a series of meetings with the government, but Panyako has termed the decision by the doctors’ officials as hypocritical and betrayal to the doctors.“As far as we are concerned they are a union on their own they have entered an agreement with the employer and there in no much we can talk about an agreement which is not ours,” Panyako said.“This is the third or fourth time he is meeting with the doctors union. We have a feeling the doctors are being used to manage other health workers. And we don’t think these things are happening in good faith,” he added.The healthcare workers have been on strike demanding for provision of quality and standard PPEs, comprehensive medical cover, risk allowance, hiring of more healthcare workers and dedicated health facilities per county for those who contract Covid-19 while on duty.“I have just been going through the agreement and I am seeing a situation where doctors are saying let us just go back to work even if we do not have a comprehensive medical cover. It is not making sense. They were saying we will not go back to die, they have now agreed to go back and die. It is hypocritical, it is betrayal, they have betrayed the doctors,” he said.He however noted that the union has agreed to lower the amount of risk allowance they were demanding from Sh30,000 to Sh20,000 for the sake of parity as suggested by the government.“We want to be told those nurses who have died when the medical cover is not in place, what happens to them. What about those nurses who are admitted in hospital, they have died and we have contributed to pay their medical bills, we want those monies we have paid in those hospitals to be refunded and given to the families left behind.”Panyako also said the nurses will not be going back to work until the government lays bare the evidence on which the medical cover provided by each county government, adding that only nurses in counties that have met the demands will be allowed to resume duty.“We are yet to see any seriousness from the ministry of health towards resolving the strike by the nurses,” the SG said."

I call upon all the leaders in the county to embrace his leadership so that we can move as a community,"" he said.In his speech read by Interior CS Matiang'i, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Nyagarama was a visionary leader who had a lot in mind as much as the people of Nyamira and the entire country were concerned.ODM leader Raila Odinga said he has lost a brave warrior who never disappointed him in the party.""We have moved miles with governor Nyagarama and I can truly say I have lost a man whom I had trust in. The transition he has made in the county since he took over can still be felt,"" Raila said.Raila called upon the deputy governor Amos Nyaribo who will take over to go by steps of Nyagarama in ensuring the county moves forward.""The projects that Nyagarama left, we wish that as you take up the mantle of leadership, ensure the projects are competed since you and Nyagarama knew what the people of Nyamira wanted,"" said Raila.Governor Nyagarama died last week at the Nairobi Hospital where he had been admitted.Interdenominational prayers were held on Wednesday where leaders mourned Nyagarama as a true leader who was dedicated in serving the residents of Nyamira and Kenyans at large.After his burial today, Deputy governor Amos Nyaribo is expected to be sworn in early next week to take over from the departed governor."

797,Busia County has vacancies for health workers - Ojaamong,"Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has disclosed that his government has advertised for positions of doctors, nurses and clinical officers after futile efforts to have the healthcare workers resume duties.Addressing mourners during the burial of John Kennedy Okada, 51, at Kidera village in Teso South Sub County on Wednesday, Ojaamong said as governors, they have resolved to employ new health workers to save suffering Kenyans from health workers who have refused to heed to their calls to resume duties as talks to end the impasse continues.""Striking workers in Busia had no reason to go on strike but they defied in ""solidarity"" with their colleagues in other counties which have not met the conditions their union leaders put on the table for the national government to fulfil,"" he said.He noted that some counties have not paid salaries of their employees for several months, a big contrast to his government which has paid healthcare workers to date, telling the workers that they will have themselves to blame if the county would have hired enough workers when return to work formula is reached.""People have soiled my name for allegedly failing to meet health workers demands yet my government has met the lion's share of the bargain to warrant industrial action from the workers,"" he emphasised.The County Chief said people look for greener pastures if what they earn from their current stations is not commensurate with their professionalism, citing his profession as a teacher when he had to call it quits due to poor remuneration then.Eulogizing his confidant whom they tarmacked together in Nairobi until he (Okada) got a job at the Nation Centre at his expense in the 1990s before flying to the US for greener pastures, the Governor said the late Okada will remain his best friend posthumously.He enumerated many projects in Teso South including the Sh69m elevation of Amukura health centre to Sub County Status, the murraming of Kidera-Kwangamor road under the fuel levy programme among others."
798,KIWASH injects Sh63m to Busia for efforts in combating Covid-19,"The Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (KIWASH) project has injected Ksh63.2million to compliment the efforts of the County Government of Busia to combat Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic in the county.Towards this end, the County Government of Busia through the Department of Water, Environment, Irrigation and Natural Resources has assigned Sh150m to compliment what development partners are undertaking in the county.Speaking before signing a joint work plan with the County Government led by the Governor Sospeter Ojaamong at the Governor’s office on Wednesday.   KIWASH Deputy Chief of Party, Calvin Odero said through a 12-month extension (September 2020 –September 2021), KIWASH has pivoted its activities to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The USD 9 million investment by USAID and the American People aims to improve access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services for an additional 140,000 Kenyan citizens in nine counties in the Financial Year 2021,” he said.Odero said KIWASH has lined up seven activities in Busia County.They include sector coordination and planning, supporting social behaviour change campaigns, risk communication and community engagement, maintaining service provision, strengthening rural water supplies and wash in healthcare facilities.Ojaamong thanked USAID for extending its stay in the county by one year noting that the agency’s efforts to extend its services to schools will help combat Covid-19 especially as schools are set to open in the New Year.The governor said the projects identified by KIWASH are well spread across the county, exuding confidence that the projects will benefit more people and institutions.“Infrastructure challenges are our major undoing despite having major rivers and Lake which could avail water to every household; we shall overcome these hurdles with partnership from development partners,” he said.Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said schools equally required water, noting that the move by KIWASH to include schools in their programme is appreciated, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, and as they are set to reopen in the new year.Water Executive Dr Isaac Alukwe said KIWASH support will entail rehabilitation of the department’s key priority projects that are vital in combating the Covid-19 menace.“Also we have a number of other partners who are coming on board.

799,"Bunyenyezi, man who paid Raila's air ticket to exile in Norway dies aged 76","When ODM leader Raila Odinga was fleeing the country from detention in 1991 to seek asylum in Norway, an anonymous Good Samaritan in Uganda would pay his air ticket.He only came to know him later in life to be Ezra Bunyenyezi.The business magnate died on December 18 at Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi aged 76.Details from the family indicate that the businessman was suffering from carcinoid syndrome, a condition which was diagnosed in 2016.""In October this year, his illness intensified and on the afternoon of December 18, he passed away in his sleep at the Aga Khan hospital in Nairobi. His wife and children were at his bedside,"" the tribute said.Raila's daughter Winnie Odinga told mourners during a mass service for Bunyenyezi on Wednesday that an intelligence officer from US embassy had told her father that the Moi government at the time was after him and ""this time they would not spare you.""So he disguised himself in a perilous boat ride through Lake Victoria to Uganda.At the UNHCR offices, she said, Raila was told to find means of leaving for Norway as the UN agency did not have funds to buy him a ticket.The police from Kenya had also learnt that he had fled to the neighbouring nation and it was a matter of time before they came for him. So it was urgent.At the time, Bunyenyezi was owning a Ugandan travel bureau.""So my father went to the bureau and requested that he books a ticket and then organize with him family in Bondo to send the money,"" she said to a still quiet audience.But an attendant at the bureau went to the back office and came back with a fully paid ticket.""My father said 'no I don't have the money yet. I'm just booking' but the attendant said she had been instructed to give a person with such names the ticket,"" she said.""Ezra never told my father that he did this to him even though they later became close friends for many years. He only learnt of it through another person,"" she added, thanking Bunyenyezi's family for saving her father's life.Bunyenyezi was eulogized as a genius businessman who had a gut feeling of what business would succeed, and they all succeeded.Besides the Uganda travel bureau, he also established the Rwanda travel bureau and Capital FM in Uganda.He is also the co-founder of Kiss FM, the pioneer outlet in Radio Africa group.He became the founder chairman of the group.Bunyenyezi is survived with his wife of 40 years Chantal and three children Gad, Keza and Nshuti.Kisumu governor Anyang' Nyong'o said he first met Bunyenyezi when he was studying in Makerere university and their friendship over decades have only grown stronger.Politician Peter Kenneth said the prolific businessman was widely knowledgeable, social and friendly."
800,"Stop threatening to sack medics, MP Alice Wahome tells Kagwe","Kandara MP Alice Wahome has asked Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe to stop issuing threats to striking medics and instead engage them in dialogue.The MP has said medics working at the front-line of the Covid-19 pandemic are constantly exposed to the virus which in turn exposes their families.This, she said, is despite the fact that their salaries are meagre and some are without comprehensive medical covers.Wahome said it is unfortunate that the CS has been grandstanding and threatening to sack the medics who are only fighting for their rights.“Give medics Personal Protective Equipment. Don’t say their demands are unreasonable because we know the salary they are being paid. We know those employed on contracts have not been paid and we also know they are working very hard and are exposed,” she said.""Seeing the medics cry and beg for extra allowances is saddening yet they spend a lot of time with Covid-19 patients which puts their lives at risk.""She cited the case of Dr Stephen Mogusu who died after contracting the virus and had not been paid for five months.""The CS should instead engage health workers in a civil way and humbly ask them to return to work because the government seems unwilling to pay them,"" she noted.“If we are unable to pay doctors, what are we doing allocating money for Building Bridges Initiative? Schools re-open in a few days yet there are no plans to provide masks. Our country is headed in the wrong direction.”Speaking at Kiawambutu primary school while commissioning a new block of classrooms on Tuesday, Wahome said Kagwe is known to be a humble leader and wondered why he has suddenly started issuing threats.She said the grandstanding between the government and the medics is causing countless deaths of Kenyans and that the situation should be remedied with urgency.She appealed to Mutahi to draft a proposal that will enable him to acquire the funds required to resolve medics’ issues so that health services can continue.“But he cannot be chest-thumping because he is just a custodian in a government made of the Kenyan people,” she said.She said training one doctor costs too much and that losing 30 of them has dealt the government a huge blow.""All resources available should be marshalled towards the fight against Covid-19 that continues to claim the lives of Kenyans,"" she pointed out.“Other nations are doing that. Soon, we will start administering Covid-19 vaccines and if we cannot afford to pay doctors, how will we afford it?”She said the referendum can wait and that the funds allocated for the process should be put to other use, and that all efforts should now be focused on the pandemic.“I heard the CS say that doctors can go on strike if they so wish. I think that is an unfortunate statement and would personally ask for an apology to the medical fraternity,” she added.Health workers, she said, should have their lives and health secured before they can secure the lives of the public."

803,Ruto’s coast allies to hasten formation of regional party to counter ODM,"Coast MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto have disclosed a plan to hasten the formation of a regional party to completely lockout ODM from the region.The legislators said that the recent victory of their candidate in Msambweni marked the begging of the end of ODM and have now embarked on the formation of an outfit to 'wipe out' the Orange party.“With the results that we posted in Msambweni on the 15th of December, we believe, it is the beginning of the end of ODM,” Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani said.Mwashetani spoke to the Star in Parliament in the company of firebrand Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa, newly installed Msambweni MP Feisal Bader and Taita Taveta woman representative Rehema Hassan.They spoke moments after Bader, an ally of the DP whose triumph shook ODM’s grip on the region, was sworn in as MP following his victory in the by-election.The legislators disclosed that they are planning to register and unveil a political vehicle that will carry the ‘hopes and aspirations’ early next year.’The yet to be formed party, they said, will form an alliance with one that will be used by the DP in his journey to State House.“Our party will be in coalition with a party that the DP will come with – whether it is Jubilee or whatever,” he said.The formation of a coastal party has been in the pipeline for years but has never materialised because of different political allegiance and affiliations of leaders from the region.ODM enjoys a massive following in the entire coastal region but its dominance was threatened a fortnight ago when an independent candidate – Bader – supported by the DP, floored ODM candidate Omar Boga in the recent mini-poll in Msambweni constituency.“We want a vessel that will bring us all on board so that we can be able to sit down on a round table and negotiate. There is so much that we have lost,” Mwashetani said.“There are so many challenges which we have been facing and we expected ODM to come and salvage us but they never turned out for us. So, we want to stand on our own and come up with a political party.”Bader, hinted at joining the DP’s political vehicle, terming him a friend who stood with him as his hour of need.“He stood with me and I want to state that I will stand with him when he goes for the top seat in 2022,” he said.The MPs thanked his constituents and rubbished opinion polls that had placed him a distant second to ODM candidate in the by-election.He disclosed that his immediate priority will be to complete the projects initiated by former late MP Suleiman Dori. Bader was Dori’s aide.They include the construction of a youth and opportunity centre.Bader said he will also focus on education as well as the roll-out of enlisting of the members with the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF)."

We analysed every detail of it and we will use lessons learnt during by-elections in Matungu, Kabuchai, Nairobi and Machakos,” he said.Speaking on Wednesday his office in Nairobi, Kobia promised to punish politicians who will threaten good relations and peaceful co-existence of persons of different ethnic and racial communities as they hunt for votes.Kobia said politicians who will incite people against each other will pay the price.“We have always been told that we are a dog that cannot bite. I want to assure Kenyans that we will not just be summoning those who will go against the law, we will be taking action against them as well,” he stated.He urged politicians to exercise restraint as the campaign for their respective candidates.“Politicians must hunt for votes within the law. We will not spare anyone,” he vowed.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is preparing for a by-election in Nairobi County and Matungu constituency.Nairobi residents will head to the polls on February 18, 2021, to elect another governor following the impeachment of Mike Sonko.The campaigns in the run-up for the Nairobi seat will start on January 18, 2021 and end on February 15, 2021.On the other hand, the electoral agency set March 4, 2021, as the date for the Matungu Constituency by-election to be held alongside five ward mini-polls.IEBC is waiting for Machakos and Kabuchai seats to be declared vacant following the deaths of Boniface Kabaka and James Mukwe Lusweti respectively.NCIC recently summoned ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna and Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa Sifuna to record statements over vulgar remarks they made during the Msambweni by-election campaigns.The two were asked to appear in person, failure to which, NCIC would institute contempt proceedings against them.Sifuna appeared before the commission on Monday while Jumwa presented herself on Tuesday. They both apologised for the remarks and promised to exercise restraint in future.Leaders have since expressed concern that the Kabuchai parliamentary by-election would be chaotic following recent clashes of Ford-K supporters at a church service.Worshippers had to scamper for safety when rival groups turned the church into a battlefield.Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi who was the chairman parliamentary committee that was in charge of the burial preparations has since warned politicians against inciting residents into causing chaos."

They are working very hard, sometimes under very difficult circumstances. They always run towards danger when we run away from it. They risk their lives for us,"" he said.""Even during this Christmas season, many of these wonderful people are going to be in dangerous spots, away from their families while we spend time with our families. Pray for them.”The CS told the public their civil liberties and rights are protected by the Constitution and urged them to channel complaints objectively for a solution to be found amicably.The Anonymous Reporting Information System (ARIS) was established for civilians to volunteer information that will help keep police officers in check, and the CS was critical of violence and blanket condemnation against the law enforcers.He spoke on Wednesday at the National Police Service College Embakasi “A” Campus, Nairobi.“Ganging up to go and attack a police station is neither wisdom nor fair behaviour. If there are mistakes, we have a well-structured system in place. If you feel that you have been treated unfairly or aggrieved, just go straight and make a report to the officer in service for further action,” the CS said.He said there are Service Standing Orders that prescribe how police do their work and that 99 per cent of officers are decent people committed to their work.“When one of us makes a mistake, it should not be a basis upon which we condemn the entire service,” the CS said.He also added countless cases brought to his attention by wananchi have been resolved.Matiang'i cited a recent case in Kisii where police are accused of killing a man for violating curfew guidelines, which he described as very unfortunate.He said a team of officers from agencies, including the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) and the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU), is investigating it and a report will be out in three days.“Where mistakes have been committed, whether within our ranks or by the civilian population, we will be guided by law and act accordingly. We will be objective and balanced looking at the facts in that particular case, and we will go the direction the investigations will point us,” the CS said.Matiangi also asked Kenyans to be wary of the coronavirus danger lurking everywhere and called for caution during this festive season.He urged them to exercise civic responsibility in adhering to the containment measures issued by the Ministry of Health and appealed for cooperation with the police in enforcement of the protocols.Matiang'i was accompanied by the Inspector General of Police, Hilary Mutyambai, Deputy Inspector General (APS), Noor Gabow, and the Secretary for Internal Security, Wilson Njega."
807,Yatani: We must adapt to the new reality,"The National Treasury has assured Kenyans of a better tomorrow as most are heading to the festivities with empty pockets and prospects of a tough 2021.Covid-19 has driven the economy to its knees and the end of the pandemic is uncertain.But Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani said despite the tough times, the government is committed to cushioning Kenyans from painful effects of the pandemic while continuing to roll out projects.In an exclusive interview with the Star, Yatani assured Kenyans the government will borrow less, increase the economic stimulus package and execute mega projects under public-private partnerships.Speaking at the Treasury building on Tuesday, the Finance chief said the nation should not despair as the pandemic has hit not only Kenya but also grounded the global economy.The CS citizens ""must adapt to reality by remaining productive and aspiring to do better.“We are calling on our people to make the best out of the circumstances, by working hard on their farms and wherever they are,” Yatani said.In attempting to send a message of hope, the CS encouraged Kenyans to appreciate there are always good and tough times – seasons of plenty and dry ones.“We must remain hopeful and hardworking. We have no other country except Kenya,"" he said.“Everyone is struggling. We must remain dignified and optimistic that these worst times will come and go and Kenya will remain,” he said.“Nobody caused this problem. The government did not cause it. President Uhuru  Kenyatta did not cause it, nor did Yatani cause it. It is beyond us.""He urged leaders to relay the right message of solidarity and hope to the Kenyan people.There has been dismay that the government has ended the tax relief President Uhuru Kenyatta announced in April to cushion individuals and businesses from the effects of the pandemic.The relief, which included a reduction in VAT, is ending while companies cannot reverse the pay cuts that most implemented to stay afloat.The waivers caused a revenue shortfall of as much as Sh186.3 billion.Civil servants are facing salary delays.The economy is projected to grow at one per cent from the initial estimates of six per cent and debt is expected to amount to Sh8.4 trillion next year.Health workers are on strike for allowances, millions have lost jobs and parents face pressure to pay school fees for four terms in one year.Yatani said he was optimistic the measures taken by the government to cushion businesses and the vulnerable of the society would help.He said the hope is that 2021 would see a reversal of job losses as the government rolls out credit guarantee schemes for SMEs.“We have identified SMEs as a nucleus of growth and we expect they will transition us into an industrialised country,” the CS said.Yatani said his strong plans for increasing government revenue, rationalising spending and staying away from lenders were hurt when the pandemic hit.The CS said he is navigating a tricky situation, more so with the fall in export and import tax earnings, which are a major revenue stream.The Treasury boss says he is faced with a dilemma of pursuing fiscal consolidation and addressing the challenges of Covid-19.This, he said, is compounded by the fact that the virus has led to non-performance of businesses, causing jobs and revenue losses.The situation is worsened by reduced fuel consumption as many people work from home, schools are closed and the tourism sector contracted by 83 per cent.Yatani said though agriculture, mining and ICT sectors grew by some margin, the loss was huge and the economy shrank by 5.7 per cent.“We also fear reducing expenditure since the economy cannot grow unless there is spending or investment,” the CS said.In this regard, he said, the Treasury has had no option but to borrow since there was no way expenditure would be frozen.The CS said fiscal consolidation was no longer a worry but the challenge is protecting people against hunger and health challenges, cushioning businesses and increasing cash flow.Yatani sought to allay fears that the borrowings to mitigate Covid-19 effects would strain the country’s serious debt problem.He said like every country, the government borrowed from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, taking advantage of the rapid credit facility extended to member countries.The CS said the Sh78 billion IMF loan for the Covid-19 fight does not attract any interest, has a three-year grace period and would be repaid in 10 years.The World Bank’s loan of Sh100 billion will be repaid at 1.4 per cent interest, has a grace period of 10 years and repayment of 30 years.Some Sh22 billion was sourced from the African Development Bank and the CS said he aims to go for multilateral loans“To a great extent, up to 90 per cent of the money was used for the right reason. Our situation would have been bad,” the CS said.Yatani said the Treasury will not approve any commercial loans, which he called the cause of the worrying debt pile-up.He asked Kenyans to appreciate that “every country borrows and most countries borrow beyond the value of their GDP.“Borrowing is not bad; how you spend whatever you have borrowed is the challenge.”Kenya’s debt is about 65 per cent of GDP, lower than Angola's (110 per cent) and Japan's (250 per cent), he said.The CS also sought to ally fears Kenya would default on its loans, citing a projected repayment plan for 10 years.“We have never defaulted on payment. We are within the target. We budget for repayment every year and fulfil as required.“Kenya has never defaulted since Independence and has never asked for debt forgiveness. But with the fall in exports, it is a tough time for u,"" Yatani said.A large chunk of resources will be dedicated to debt repayment.“We are highly sustainable but pressure from Covid-19 has put a strain on us. It is not that we are not able to pay but revenue is low. Since debt payment is the first charge on the Consolidated Fund, we remain with insufficient resources to settle all other obligations,” Yatani explained.He said borrowing is now under control with the establishment of an autonomous Public Debt Management Office at Treasury.“We are careful because if revenue is not growing and debt increases, we will have a problem. We get professional advice from the team so unless they concur, we cannot borrow,” Yatani said.To beat the small window for borrowing, he said the government has strengthened the Public-Private Partnerships unit to facilitate investments.In the system, local banks and firms would undertake projects and the public will pay for it – as for the Nairobi Expressway.“If we were to borrow money for the expressway, it would have put a strain on us. We want to use PPPs to substitute for borrowing,” Yatani said.The PPP unit is a directorate headed by director general Christopher Kirigua, a banker.CS Yatani said that with gains in the manufacturing sector – citing local industries churning out PPE and masks – the country is headed for a better future.President Kenyatta’s administration floated a Sh54 billion economic stimulus package, part of which was for local industries.The government intends to set aside Sh930 billion for post-Covid-19 economic recovery.(Edited by V.

808,Referendum money will be provided – Yatani,"The National Treasury will provide money for a referendum to implement the Building Bridges Initiative proposals.Treasury CS Ukur Yatani said the government cannot fail to get resources for whatever it treats as a top priority.“All the time we have money against as many demands. We can forego some expenditure, projects or programmes,” the CS said.The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has said the votes would cost Sh14 billion. But ODM leader Raila Odinga has disputed the amount and has embarked on a call for further reduction of election costs.The Treasury last Thursday approved Sh93.7 million for the IEBC to verify 4.4 million signatures supporting the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.The Bill creates posts of prime minister and two deputies, leader of the official opposition and seeks for MPs to be appointed ministers – changes which require a referendum to implement.While cautioning that his comments should not be confused for engaging in the raging BBI politics, Yatani said the referendum is considered as a process worth investing in.“It is worth investing and allocating resources to. Who said this is not important? In my view, it is one of the most important things,” the CS said.“This is because we want to grow the nation rather than ethnic enclaves and political processes whose determinants are only how tribes have come together.”The CS said the BBI is a moment of reflection and stands to provide the right environment for economic growth.Yatani warned that Kenya would be at a higher risk of slowed or stalled economic growth if people continue with “the antagonistic political play that comes every five years”.He cited the 2007 post-poll chaos that shattered the economy “because of politics, winner takes all and opaqueness in the contest.”“Anybody who thinks about the economy must think about the circumstances going to provide that environment for sustainability,” the Treasury boss said.He said elections must not be viewed as an event and that Kenyans must be desirous of a stable country where political competition is considered an ordinary event.“We cannot continue having our progress tied to an event. When you plan with the long-term, you will have faster and sustainable development.”Yatani drummed support for investing in the BBI, citing gains in “institutionalising the rights of every individual irrespective of where they come, communities or political alignment.”The CS said it was a privilege that President Uhuru Kenyatta has appointed members of minority communities to his administration.“We feel privileged because were it not for the decision of the head of state, minorities would not have occupied these offices because they don’t have the numbers. The people with numbers will come and share positions, a situation that the BBI is trying to change,” he said.(edited by o. owino)"
809,I'll rout Ruto and Raila candidates in Matungu — Wajackoyah's man,"Roots Party of Kenya aspirant for the Matungu by-election Noah Shiunzi on Friday expressed confidence that he will emerge the winner.Speaking in Nairobi after he was given the green light to fly the party’s flag, Shiunzi said he is ready to face off with big boys being sponsored by the political bigwigs. ODM leader Raila Odinga, Deputy President William Ruto's Tangatanga faction and the Jubilee Party have all indicated that they will field candidates. Roots was founded by former presidential candidate George Wajackoyah. Shiunzi said he has what it takes to succeed Justus Murunga who passed away last month after a short illness.""I have my manifesto and I have already rolled out my campaigns. I had already started my campaigns since I was to challenge Murunga in 2022,” he said.Should he be elected, Shiunzi said he will prioritise education and empowerment of the youth and women. He said with the collapse of Mumias Sugar Company, which was the main source of employment in the Kakamega county, he will work round the clock to create jobs for the youth.""Literacy levels in the constituency have dropped over the years and therefore I intend to rally the community on that. We are also facing the challenge of early marriages, which I will address,” the trained teacher said.The by-election has been set for March 4 next year.Shiunzi called on the residents not to accept to be bribed “by individuals who after winning will no longer care for them”.“The people of Matungu need a leader who will improve their lives. That is why I have offered my candidature because I am determined and I have the vision to change Matungu for better,” he said.""I am ready to face my competitors whether I have money or not. Leadership is about what you plan to do for the people and not how deep your pocket is.”Roots Party of Kenya head of logistics Paul Omole said they settled on Shiunzi because of his vision for residents.“Roots Party of Kenya stands for justice and democracy. Shiunzi has proved that he is that man who is ready to empower the people, hence we have given him the certificate. This is a young man who is a teacher by profession and we have confidence that he will win. He is the best candidate,” Omole said."
810,We're ready to bring in Covid-19 vaccines — Unicef,"Unicef says all plans are ready to fly Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries next year. The UN agency said it could potentially transport up to 850 tonnes per month in 2021, should such quantities become available.Kenya has ordered 24 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine but is waiting for it to be granted emergency use approval in Britain, before allowing the same here.In total, researchers around the world are currently testing 63 vaccines in clinical trials on humans, and 18 have reached the final stages of testing. Eight of these candidates have been granted emergency use or limited use approvals. These are Pfizer-BioNTech which is approved in the US, Canada, Britain and other countries. Others are Moderna of the US and Sputnik V and Vector Institute vaccine of Russia.The rest are from China — made by CanSino, Sinopharm-Beijing, Sinopharm-Wuhan and Sinovac. Of these, only the Moderna vaccine is under the Covax Facility, from which Unicef will procure the doses for 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries.Frontrunners Johnson & Johnson, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Novavax are in the facility but have not been approved for use anywhere yet.“This is a mammoth and historic undertaking,” said Henrietta Fore, Unicef executive director. “The scale of the task is daunting, and the stakes have never been higher, but we are ready to take this on.”In an assessment, Unicef looked at global airfreight capacity and transport routes to better understand the challenges of delivering Covid-19 vaccines in 2021.It found that commercial airlines will be able to deliver vaccines to almost all 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries, which are among the 190 economies participating in the Covax Facility, at an estimated cost of up to $70 million (about Sh7 billion).The assessment also found that current air cargo capacity would be sufficient to make deliveries covering 20 per cent of the population for most of the 92 countries.Covid-19 vaccines are expected to be primarily shipped using existing passenger and cargo flight capacity, although charters or alternative transport options may still be needed for some small countries and others with access issues.Unicef is working with airlines and the wider logistics industry to prioritise the delivery of the vaccines around the world. One major challenge in the Covid-19 vaccine operation is local cold chain capacity for vaccine storage within some low and lower-middle-income countries.Given the range of storage temperatures required for Covid-19 vaccines, countries will continue to train logisticians and health workers in how to keep the vaccines at the right temperatures.As part of a programme that started in 2017, with support from Gavi, Unicef continues to procure and support the installation of 70,000 cold-chain fridges in lower-income countries by the end of 2021, which will help in the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines that need to be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. Almost half of these will be solar-powered."
811,"Allow children with no fees back in class upon reopening, Magoha directs schools","Education CS George Magoha has urged schools not to send children with no fees back home when schools reopen in January.Magoha has ordered the unconditional return of all learners to class and proposed that the institutions and parents come up with payment schedules.""All children have to return back to school, head teachers and principals should go slow on those who would be unable to pay fees,"" he said.The CS was on an inspection tour to assess the level of schools' preparedness.However, Kenya Secondary School Heads Association chairman Indimuli Kahi urged the government to release capitation to enable institutions to run their operations upon reopening.“Schools solely depend on direct fees paid by parents and capitation. If parents will not be able to give the money on time, then the government should,” Kahi said.Magoha noted that Rift Valley, Central and Nairobi top in preparation but the same was not the case in Northern Kenya. Turkana is the worst prepared, according to the CS, at about 12 per cent.He also said the government is working to assist learners displaced by floods during the closure period. He said the ministry had mapped about 25 schools in Bundalang'i, Nyando, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo and West Pokot.Public school heads have also been ordered to admit children from private schools that were closed down during the pandemic. He also indicated that KCPE, KCSE exams are ready.For those taking exams in such schools, ""the government could be forced to create temporary examination centres in schools that have been closed down"". Upon reopening, the schools will hugely depend on masks to protect learners from Covid-19, the CS argued.The development comes even as the institutions grapple with congestion; however, Magoha argues that this should not be sensationalised to derail the planned reopening.He insisted that the government will not be able to provide masks for all learners but only those from the poorest families.“We have provided close to one million masks to schools that will be given to the poor families. The government will not be in a position to provide masks to each learner, so parents have to get into their pockets and at least provide two reusable masks for their learners. This should not be a hard thing to do,” he said."
812,"No tender graft under my watch, says NHIF boss Gathege","The era of tender fixing and graft-induced procurement at the NHIF is over, chief executive officer Peter Gathege has promised.Gathege spoke as claims of wars regarding critical multi-billion shilling tenders at the National Hospital Insurance Fund emerged.The new CEO who took over in April this year said that he had invited the National Intelligence Service to monitor the tender award processes.“One of the things we did was to ensure that it’s not just our team that is involved. We have also invited the Ministry of ICT and NIS to give us support. It’s a serious commitment,” he told the Star.To ensure integrity and accountability, he said, they have established a section dealing with compliance enforcement.Many former NHIF bosses including Gathege’s predecessor Geofrey Mwangi ended up in court over procurement-related scandals.NHIF had advertised six lucrative ICT-related contracts as part of its preparations to roll out universal healthcare, a key pillar of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda.The fund wants to acquire among others a biometric system for registration of Kenyans for the UHC, a contribution module, a claims system and an ERP software.In an interview with the Star, Gathege said he is determined to transform NHIF and there would be no sacred cows in that endeavour.He said they have established systems to ensure that the process is above board and warned he will not hesitate to crack the whip if any irregularities are uncovered.“I am sure you have seen we have taken to court a number of people including our own staff,” he told the Star.“We are assuring the public the processes will be above board and if there is anything found off we will take action. That is my principle, which I think even my staff know.”He went on: “It’s a principle and a culture that we want to sustain. And one of the things I am committed to doing is restoring that trust. The fact that something was not properly done in the past doesn’t mean that is how it will continue.”The tender closing date was postponed twice as bidders keen to bag the awards inundated the agency with queries.Claims of tender-fixing soon emerged, amid allegations that some insiders were hellbent on awarding the contract to a technology firm whose subsidiary has recently been shrouded in controversy.There are claims that the firm was the only bidder set to get to the financial evaluation in Lot2 of tender number 15 for the supply, installation testing and commissioning of the ERP and claims management system.There are allegations, however, that during tender opening the firm was allowed to proceed to the evaluation stage without some critical documents, including the mandatory bid bond.“This would have technically locked them out,” a source familiar with the behind-the-scene intrigues told the Star."
813,Kitui opens man-made dryland beach for holiday fun,"Semi-arid Kitui county has opened a manmade beach on a manmade lake for boating, kayaking, jet skiing and fun in the sun.The Kalundu Eco Park in Kitui town will also have a floating restaurant.“This is Kitui’s man-made beach, the first dryland beach in Kenya,"" Governor Charity Ngilu tweeted on Tuesday night. It opened on Tuesday.It is expected to provide business opportunities and jobs.She said the eco park will be a recreation alternative for people unable to travel to regular holiday destinations because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The governor spent most of Tuesday afternoon officiating at the opening.Creating the dryland beach cost Sh3 million. Other facilities, including a floating restaurant, will be built through a public-private partnership.The ceremony was attended by Kitui government staff led by CEC for Tourism and Sports Koki Musau. Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau attended.The 30.9-acre recreational facility includes a nine-acre, man-made dam and paved walkways. It is billed as the epitome of Kitui's tourism attractions.“I have today officially opened it for use during the Christmas festivities, especially at this tough time of the pandemic when travel to traditional holiday destinations is severely limited,"" the governor said.She added the Kenyan Coast has come to semi-arid Kiitui.Ngilu said business-minded residents could cash in by tapping into its value chain.""This is an investment that will spur business opportunities inside and outside the eco park and create employment,"" she said.(Edited by V.

814,Avoid real-time social media posts on your vacation,"The festive season brings a lot of excitement, long breaks away from work, family gatherings and vacations to various destinations to unwind after a long  stressful year.It's tempting to tell all your friends what you're doing away from home.Most people share real-time special moments with their online friends on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, among others.But these could signal to criminals that your home is vacant for sometime and a target.SGA Security  CEO Julius Delahaije said online ‘friends’ could turn out to be burglars scouting for evidence and clues about one’s whereabouts, especially with the whole family.These daily clues suggest a home will remain unoccupied for a time.“Burglars tend to plan most home break-ins in advance. They look for clues to ‘sweep’ the home, Delahaije said.""In most cases, they target their victims remotely through social media channels.""Online signs are not the only clues. Burglars also cruise through neighbourhoods for offline clues such as locked doors, windows, drawn curtains, absence of cars and little or no movements in a house or compound.“Let us all remain vigilant throughout the festive season. If possible, assign someone to keep checking the house or business property while away,” he advised.KEEP LOCATION SECRET Most social media posts tag locations and photos while on the go, suggesting step by step movement, such as 'at the airport', 'travelling to Malindi', 'having fun at XXX hotel', giving clues to thieves.Take time to familiarise yourself with privacy settings and features of all social media accounts. Only divulge locations to audiences chosen by you, not to the public.Delahaije reiterated the need to be vigilant while shopping in malls, in parking lots and implementing the Nyumba Kumi initiative whereby neighbours look out for each other and their property.With Covid-19 protocols to maintain social distancing, it is easy to notice anyone trying to get too close - they might snatch a mobile phone, handback, laptop back, jewellry. Even get away with  your car.“Threat actors are all over looking for targets,"" the security expert said.""I would also advise making use of technology such as CCTV cameras at homes and businesses that one can monitor through an internet-enabled phone or computer from anywhere.”Other measures to improve security include investing in smart door locks, deploying security guards and dogs.Delahaije was speaking a day after Police IG announced the deployment of extra security officers countrywide during the festive season.SGA Security is a private security provider with operations in East Africa (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania), servicing security contracts throughout the continent.(Edited by V.

815,"NHIF to offer enhanced life insurance, work injury benefits to 131,000 police and prison officers","Some 131,816 National Police Service and the Kenya Prisons Services’ officers are set to benefit from an enhanced group life insurance cover beginning January 1, 2021.This follows the signing of a contract with the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) for the provision of the services on Tuesday.In the deal, NHIF will also offer the officers improved work injury benefits as the government endeavors to sustain the gains at the policy level and in line with relevant legislations.According to Karanja Kibicho, the Principal Secretary for Interior and Citizen Services, the move is part of the state’s systematic efforts to institutionalize a welfare and protection programme for the officers who have to contend with life-changing situations through the course of their duties.“We have had challenges in providing our officers with these services, and that is why we decided to engage NHIF to protect them just like the other civil servants,” he said after signing the agreement at Harambee House.Kibicho added that the entities were strictly guided by the existing public procurement procedures.The agreement is a culmination of lengthy deliberations and consultations among the key stakeholders, who settled on the intra-government contracting model.This was with a view to addressing the escalating claims of unpaid life insurance and annuity benefits to service members or their designated beneficiaries.According to the PS, the ultimate goal is to harmonize the insurance policy benefits of the officers with those of other civil servants and tailor them to address the vulnerabilities of the surviving families of those who lose their lives in line of duty.Also in attendance was State Department for Correctional Services PS Zeinab Hussein, who hailed the move as a big motivating factor that has been lacking in the past.The sentiments were also echoed by the Inspector General of the National Police, Hillary Mutyambai, and the Commissioner-General for the Kenya Prisons Service, Wycliffe Ogallo.NHIF Chief Executive Officer, Dr Peter Gathege, vouched for the progressive optimisation initiatives at the state-owned insurer and undertook to ensure timely payment of claims to the officers.To further caution officers, the state will launch a Trust Fund for the welfare of the families of police officers killed on duty.Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said the move is part of the President’s desire to accord genuine recognition and appreciation to the honourable services and selfless sacrifices of police officers.Speaking during a memorial service for fallen police officers at the National Police Service Training College in Nairobi earlier this month, Matiang’i, said the Trust Fund will be unveiled in a fortnight.Further, the CS said that they were under firm instructions from the President to establish a new ultra-modern facility at the Police Headquarters before the end of January 2021.The facility will look at aspects of welfare including paying of gratuity and pension benefits to police officers, even when they exit through natural attrition."
816,Police officer linked to murder of journalist found dead in Machakos,"Sabina Kerubo, a senior policer linked to death of a Star journalist, was found dead in her house at Komarock area, Machakos on Tuesday.Police reports indicate that her boyfriend reported the incident at KBC police station, prompting area sub county police commander and criminal investigation boss to visit the scene.She was found lying on a mattress at the floor of the single-roomed house, dead.“The deceased mother Elizabeth Kwamboka, who resides along Kangundo Road, came and alleged that the deceased had previously refused to stay with her due to drunkenness,” a report filed at KBC police Station under OB No 17/22/12/2020 reads in part.Police say the body looked weak and emaciated and that remains of beer bottles were found in the house.Last year, Kerubo appeared in court over murder of the then Star correspondent Erick Oloo.In a case love gone sour, Oloo had been found dead at her rented house in Ugunja, Siaya on November 2019, with reports saying she conspired with her brothers and an unknown man to beat Oloo to death at her house.At the time, Kerubo was Ugunja Police Station deputy OCS.She was transferred from Western to the headquarters to attend counselling."
817,Kenya Railways suspends commuter rail services in four stations for 11 days,"Railway services in four major Nairobi Commuter stations have been suspended for 11 days.This comes as Kenya Railways on Wednesday announced the scaling down of Nairobi Commuter Rail services during the festive season. This will see the commuter rail services which operating to Embakasi, Syokimau, Ruiru and Kikuyu be suspended from December 24, 2020, until January 3rd, next year. The announcement was made by the Kenya Railways management through a public notice.However, the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport express service and the Madaraka Express passenger service will still continue to operate as usual.Also, the Nairobi-Nanyuki Rail Service will be operational.At the same time, Kenya Railways has also adjusted the Nairobi- Nanyuki Rail service schedule to accommodate increased demand by passengers travelling during the festive season.There will be a train from The Central Railway station on December 24, 2020, to Nanyuki and one returning back to the capital on Sunday, December 27, 2020.The departure time on both dates will be at 9:00 a.m. with commuters only paying Sh.200 for economy class and Sh.1000 for Business.The train will make its various stops at Thika, Mitubiri, Makuyu, Maragua, Murang’a, Sagana, Karatina, Kiganjo and Naro Moru.The Nairobi Commuter Rail Service (NCR) was introduced in May 1992 in response to a series of strikes by the Matatu minibus operators.But over the years, there has been a low level of demand which according to the new managing director has been due to poor standards of the station’s facilities.On November 10, 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Nairobi Commuter Rail System which consisted of new Diesel Mobile Units and Commuter Rail Buses.The Nairobi Central Station will serve as the nerve centre of operations connecting to 10 stations.Currently, there are commuter train services on Nairobi - Imara Daima-Syokimau route, Nairobi - Githurai - Mwiki - Kahawa – Ruiru route, Nairobi-Embakasi route, and Nairobi - Kibera – Kikuyu route.Kenya Railways is targeting to serve up to 230,000 passengers daily once the commuter rail is launched.The JKIA expressway is an extension of the Nairobi commuter rail service targeting air travellers and airport users.It was launched on December 7, 2020, by Transport CS James Macharia and Kenya Railways Managing Director Philip Mainga.It is expected to target over 24,000 passengers, workers and other users of the airport once it will be launched.Passengers willing to use the JKIA express route would have to part with Sh500 but was reduced to Sh 250 for the next 90 daysThis is inclusive of the BRT buses that will ferry to the airport them once they reach the Embakasi station."
818,Inside the new look 2021 UHC plan,"The year 2020 was to be the biggest for health in Kenya – and still is.By December 2020, millions of Kenyans were to have the broadest access to health services since Independence, courtesy of a Sh40 billion per year Universal Health Coverage.But then Covid-19 happened.The country has so far spent more than Sh200 billion in fighting Covid-19 in the last nine months, leaving more than half of Kenyans to pay for health services out of pocket.Much of this money was spent on personal protective equipment, ventilators, ICU equipment, and the upgrade of health facilities to respond to the growing Covid-19 burden.The move toward UHC was launched on December 13, 2018, by President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Health CS Sicily Kariuki, who is now in the Water ministry.At least 3.2 million residents of four pilot counties - Machakos, Kisumu, Nyeri and Isiolo – received free services in public hospitals at a cost of Sh3.9 billion.The plan was to be expanded countrywide in March this year.However, the growing threat from Covid-19 around the world, reaching Kenya on March 13, changed everything.UHC is one of the Big Four agenda Uhuru wants to transform Kenya with by 2022. The others are manufacturing, food security and affordable housing.The pandemic has since grounded the economy and most of the Big Four.However, on October 31, Uhuru quietly launched a biometric registration exercise to salvage the UHC.The programme will now be refashioned and relaunched nationally in 2021.Each household will pay Sh6,000 a year to the National Hospital Insurance Fund to access the rejigged UHC services.Only about one million poor Kenyans will access free services. The rest will have to pay NHIF premiums.However, the government will still top up so that premium-paying Kenyans can access enhanced services under a new essential benefits package.In implementing the rejigged UHC, the government will focus on five major pillars.First, the government will drastically restructure NHIF, to create a national social health insurer that can meet the needs of Kenyans by strategically purchasing services for their health.“In this regard, I direct the Ministry of Health and the Attorney General to fast-track the necessary legislation that will codify these reforms in law and foster the sustainability of the fund,” Uhuru said on October 31.The government will then establish a mandatory UHC scheme, which will be managed by NHIF and regulated by the Ministry of Health.Third, the ministry will adopt a new Essential Health Benefits Package, which will enable Kenyans to access a defined set of health services at Sh6,000 a year. The package will cover several areas including outpatient and inpatient services, communicable and non-communicable disease management, maternity, dialysis, radiology, mental health, minor and major surgery, substance abuse rehabilitation, emergency services and cancer treatment.However, to access the services, each household must pay Sh6,000 to NHIF every year.Fourth, the government will provide health insurance to initially cover one million households who are vulnerable and unable to pay the Sh6,000. The identification of these one million households by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, is ongoing.The President said the biometric registration of identified poor households will be used to improve efficiency and curb fraud and abuse.“I urge the NHIF to ensure that the precious funds committed to its custody, by both subscribers and supporters, are utilised prudently with utmost transparency and accountability.  Any person who attempts to defraud the NHIF or abuse its processes, will be dealt with accordingly as provided for under our laws,” Uhuru said during the launch of the biometric exercise on October 31 in Mombasa.The Council of Governors has endorsed the refurbished scheme and pledged its full support for its successful execution.CoG chairman Wycliffe Oparanya said for effective implementation of the policies that will guide the UHC, funds must be made available to the counties.He said Kenya has brilliant brains but lacks trust in each other.""Because there is no trust, implementation becomes a problem,"" the Kakamega governor said.He said counties must have a say in NHIF to ensure there is a smooth flow of funds to the proposed UHC Fund.Currently, there is only one representative of counties in the Kemsa board.""Since 70 per cent of these medicines go to counties, we should have 70 per cent representation in Kemsa,"" Oparanya said.Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the launch of the biometric registration of indigents into the UHC is the beginning of a new journey that will have some challenges ahead.""We have a new baby in town with teething problems. We expect challenges, but we will be addressing the challenges as they come,"" Kagwe said."
819,Year that HPV vaccination targets were missed,"When the government launched the human papillomavirus vaccine on October 18 last year, the target was to reach 800,000 girls within a year.But the Star has learnt that one year later, only 360,000 girls have so far received the lifesaving jab.Head of Immunisation Programmes Dr Collins Tabu attributed the low numbers to the onset of Covid-19. The national immunisation programme was affected due to severe health system constraints and physical distancing measures.“It is largely because much as the vaccine is being offered in every health facility, the other aspect is that the targeted outreaches for the vaccine were to be conducted jointly with schools but schools were closed due to the pandemic,” Tabu said.The vaccine is administered on 10-year-old girls in two doses, six months apart, to prevent cervical cancer. Apart from cervical cancer, the vaccine also prevents anal warts and cancer of the vulva.About 9,000 public, private and faith-based facilities countrywide were targeted in the drive. The vaccine is administered free of charge. The country has 1.3 million doses of the vaccine in stock, acquired for Sh800 million. The fear of contracting Covid-19 has made some parents give health facilities a wide berth, hence missing out on routine immunisation for their children, including the HPV vaccine.""We are behind schedule but again just like the other vaccines, plans are underway to catch up with the vaccination,” Tabu said.In Kenya, cancer of the cervix is the second most common in girls and women aged between 15 and 44 years. Breast cancer is the first.It kills nine women every day, about 3,000 every year.The cost of treatment remains the greatest impediment towards early screening in Kenya. Screening costs at least Sh3,000.According to the National Cancer Control Programme, treatment is costly. Charges range between Sh172,000 and Sh759,000 to treat cervical cancer without surgery and Sh672,000 to Sh1.2 million if an operation is carried out.The World Health Organization recommends vaccination of all girls and screening at least once every year for older women to reduce the risk of cancer.African countries have been slow to roll out the HPV vaccine to their populations, despite the continent having a high incidence of cervical cancer, which the vaccine helps to prevent.Currently, only 10 African governments offer the HPV vaccine in their national immunisation packages, according to the WHO and Gavi, the vaccine's alliance. These are Botswana, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Uganda, Tanzania, Senegal, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.Benda Kithaka, co-founder Women 4 Cancer NGO, said although some countries vaccinate boys, it was cost-effective for Kenya to begin with girls.""Boys may be affected by penile or anal cancer but 99 per cent of cancers caused by HPV affect the cervix, so for a public health approach and to ensure safety, we are focusing on women and girls,"" she said.A recent report shows that the availability of pap smear stands at just seven per cent in health facilities nationally.Pap smear enables doctors to detect lesions or abnormal cells in the cervix that can be treated before they turn cancerous.Kenya has yet to come up with screening guidelines, but most countries recommend that women have their first cervical cancer test at the age of 21.With schools scheduled to fully reopen in January, the hope is that the uptake of the vaccine will receive a boost as targeted girls are easily reached."
820,The Star honours its 2020 top performing journalists,"The Star newspaper on Wednesday honoured its journalists for exemplary performance during 2020.Despite the challenges that came with the Covid-19 pandemic, the Star journalists produced some of the best journalism work over the year.This year's awards took a different format with the journalists being voted for by their own colleagues with the editors' role only limited to validating the votes.Radio Africa Group's Head of Content Paul Ilado lauded the journalists for rising above the challenges that came with the pandemic to keep the newspaper, its website and all other digital platforms running.Ilado noted that despite the challenges, the Star continued to produce some of the best stories in the country that not only triggered debate but awakened the nation's consciousness. The Star Chief Operating Officer Agnes Kalekye thanked the editorial team for its persistence despite the challenges that came with the pandemic and depressed revenues. Radio Africa Group's Digital Editor Oliver Mathenge congratulated the entire editorial team for the continued content generation for the online platforms.He noted that there was immense growth over the year with new digital products in place adding that 2021 would be a year of moving even further.Radio Africa Group, which owns the Star, prides itself as the home of great talent across print, radio, digital and TV platforms.Health Reporter John Muchangi was awarded the coveted Journalist of the Year Award as well as the General News Reporter Award for his groundbreaking coverage on Covid-19.Meshack Kisenge won Sports Reporter of the year award, Martin Mwita who won Business Reporter of the year while Leah Mutimba won radio journalist of the year.Entertainment writer Elizabeth Musyimi was named lifestyle and society reporter of the year, Mercy Mumo won photographer of the year, Annette Wambulwa won legal reporter of the year Jambes Mbaka got the political reporter of the year.Otieno Owino won copy editor of the year, Vincent Okeyo got the graphic designer of the year award while Andrew Kasuku was named the Resilience person of the year."
821,Find solution to ongoing strike - Ruto urges health workers,"Deputy President William Ruto has asked the Ministry of Health, County governments and the health workers' unions to find an amicable solution to the ongoing strike.Speaking on Wednesday, he said the industrial action was threatening the lives of millions of Kenyans, especially during this coronavirus era.The Deputy President said engaging in shouting matches among the concerned parties was not only unhealthy but also dangerous for the nation.“The challenge that we now have is the shouting matches among the ministry of health, county governments and the health workers unions. This is unhealthy and dangerous for our nation,” Ruto said.Addressing leaders from Webuye East, Bungoma County, at his Sugoi home in Uasin Gishu County, on Wednesday, Ruto said a platform for negotiation should be embraced to ensure Kenyan lives and those of health workers are not endangered.“We must protect the lives of nurses, doctors and Kenyans should be protected. This is why we must have a mechanism to ensure no side loses in this matter,” he said.He added, “The ministry of health, county governments, doctors and nurses should find a commonality to agree on how to manage the situation so as not to get out of control.”At the same time, Ruto said failure by some leaders to concede defeat, was to blame for chaotic situations witnessed after every general election in the country.“If leaders could accept defeat after every election, there could be no chaotic situations in this country,” he said.He also pointed out that the problems facing the country were largely because of poor leadership, noting that leaders were focused on issues beneficial to them at the expense of service delivery.“Leaders should focus on addressing challenges facing majority of Kenyans above their own selfish gains if we are to reduce poverty and unemployment among Kenyans,” he said.Ruto said more focus should have been given to the Big Four agenda that intends to provide more than 500,000 jobs to Kenyans, other than the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) that aims to create positions for some a few individuals.The deputy president added that the Jubilee administration had progressed on well in the initiation of development projects.He said when Jubilee took over in 2013, two million Kenyans were connected to electricity but seven years later, more than six million people are connected to power.“We have achieved a lot in terms of development,” Ruto added.MPs Didmus Barasa (Kimilili) and John Waluke (Sirisia), urged the Luhya community to support Ruto for presidency in 2022.“The Luhya community will greatly benefit from the leadership of Dr Ruto in 2022 because his development track record is clear,” Waluke said.Barasa dismissed calls by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga on IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati to resign.“Raila should leave alone the work of Chebukati so that he can continue doing the work that Kenyans gave him,” Barasa said."
822,286 recoveries as the country records 427 new cases,"Kenya records 427 new Covid-19 cases bringing the total number to 95,195This is from a sample size of 7,593 tested in the last 24 hours, bringing the cumulative tests to 1,021,880.Of the cases, 406 are Kenyans while 21 are foreigners.Genderwise, 256 are males and 171 are females.As for the ages, the youngest is a five-year-old child while the oldest is 87 years old.In terms of recoveries, 286 patients have recovered from the disease, bringing the total number of recoveries in the country to 76,508.228 are from the home based care program while 58 are from various health facilities.On a sad note, one patient has succumbed to the disease, bringing the total number of deaths in the country to 1,648.More to follow..."
823,"Uhuru signs Tax Laws (Amendment), Tea bills into law","President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday at State House, Nairobi, signed into law the Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill 2020 which was passed on Tuesday by Members of the National Assembly.Also signed into law is the Tea Bill of 2018, which contains several reforms among them, the re-engineering of the Tea Board of Kenya to oversee the development, promotion and regulation of Kenya's tea sector.The bills were presented to Uhuru for signature by Solicitor General Ken Ogeto at the brief ceremony attended by Agriculture CS Peter Munya, Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka and Leader of Majority in the National Assembly Amos Kimunya.Also present were Head of Public Service Dr Joseph Kinyua, State House Deputy Chief of Staff Njee Muturi, Clerk of the National Assembly Michael Sialai and his Senate counterpart Jeremiah Nyengenye.Last week, the government announced that Kenyans earning below Sh24,000 could be exempted from paying income tax should MPs pass a law expanding the tax bands for salaried workers.This followed a proposal to amend the law to provide that incomes of that amount attract 100 per cent Pay As You Earn tax relief.The Tax Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2020, further seeks to increase the highest tax band from the current Sh47,060 to Sh74,000."
824,Preparation underway for burial of Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama,"Burial preparations for Nyamira County Governor, the late John Obiero Nyagarama, are in top gear both at his home at Tente and funeral ceremony venue at Nyamira Primary school grounds.Nyamira County funeral planning and execution committee are doing the last-minute preparation to ensure that they give the late governor a befitting send off.Nyamira County commissioner, Amos Mariba, who is chairing the planning and execution committee, confirmed that the departed leader will be given a state burial on Thursday and the Head of State has confirmed his attendance.“We want to ensure that all the necessary preparations for the burial of our departed leader are finalized on time to avoid unnecessary last-minute rush which may bring unwarranted confusion and embarrassment,” the commissioner said.He further urged all the committee members who have been assigned specific duties in ensuring that the ceremony is a success to work round the clock so that all goes as planned.He clarified that the late governor’s burial will be held.

825,Trump urges Congress to amend 'wasteful' coronavirus aid bill,"US President Trump has urged Congress to amend a $900bn (£670bn) coronavirus relief bill to more than triple its stimulus payments to Americans.In a video message posted on Twitter, he said the package ""really is a disgrace"", full of ""wasteful"" items.""It's called the Covid relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with Covid,"" he said.The $900bn bill includes one-off $600 payments to most Americans, but Mr Trump said the figure should be $2,000.His statement stunned Capitol Hill. Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating a coronavirus stimulus rescue package since July and Mr Trump - who has largely stayed out of the talks - had been expected to sign the legislation into law following its passage through Congress on Monday night.The package of measures is linked to a bigger government spending bill, which includes foreign aid funding as well as a $1.4tn spending measure to fund federal agencies for the next nine months. Those agencies will have to shut if the president vetoes or refuses to sign it by midnight next Monday.Most legislation that comes from Congress requires the approval of the president before becoming law.However, Mr Trump has not specifically said he would veto the bill. Even if he does, US media say there could be enough votes from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress to override his veto.What did Trump say?In Tuesday night's message from the White House, Mr Trump baulked at spending in the bill on other countries, arguing that this money should go to struggling Americans.He said: ""This bill contains $85.5m for assistance to Cambodia, $134m to Burma, $1.3bn for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment, $25m for democracy and gender programmes in Pakistan, $505m to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.""The president questioned why the Kennedy Center, a performing arts complex in Washington DC, was set to receive $40m when it is not open, and more than $1bn has been allocated to museums and galleries in the capital.Mr Trump concluded: ""Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists and special interests, while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it. It wasn't their fault. It was China's fault.""I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000 or $4,000 for a couple.""I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package.""What's in the aid bill?On Monday afternoon, congressional leaders unveiled a 5,593-page package and voted on it several hours later.Several lawmakers protested that they had not been given an opportunity to read the contents.Nevertheless the bill sailed through the House of Representatives by 359-53 and the Senate by 92-6.The relief package contains a number of provisions that will help tens of millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet in the pandemic-battered economy.The one-off payments of $600 are half the sum provided by the last major coronavirus aid bill in March, which contained $2.4tn in economic relief.Monday's package extends federal jobless benefits of up to $300 per week for 11 weeks, although this again is half the amount provided by the previous bill.The package contains $25bn in rental aid and extends an eviction moratorium that was due to expire at the end of this month, a lifeline for millions of Americans.The bill also bans surprise medical billing - where hospital patients get slapped with often exorbitant stealth fees because they were treated by a doctor who was not covered by their health insurer.But after poring over the mammoth legislation, journalists and critics have highlighted a string of alleged giveaways for lobbyists.The Washington Post, for example, reports that the package contains $110bn in tax breaks for sectors such as the liquor industry and motorsports entertainment.How have politicians reacted?On Tuesday, President-elect Joseph Biden said the coronavirus bill was merely a ""down payment"" and vowed he would press lawmakers to pass another stimulus bill after he enters office next month.""Congress did its job this week,"" the Democrat said, speaking from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, ""and I can and I must ask them to do it again next year.""The most powerful congressional Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, usually a fierce antagonist of the president, said she agreed with Mr Trump's call for $2,000 one-off stimulus payments for every American.""Let's do it!"" she tweeted, pledging that her party would bring the proposal to the floor this week.Such a plan would need to be passed by the Republican-controlled Senate, where it may well face resistance.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch ally of President Trump, responded to Ms Pelosi with his own tweets welcoming her support for increasing payments, and saying ""let's go further"" and ""agree with President Trump that Big Tech needs to be reined in by winding down Section 230 liability protections"".The Democratic minority leader of the Senate, Chuck Schumer, tweeted: ""Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open and we're glad to pass more aid Americans need""."
826,Ruto meets Feisal Bader after Msambweni triumph,"Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday held a meeting with Msambweni Constituency grassroots leaders led by the newly-elected MP Feisal Bader at his Karen residence in Nairobi County. Also present at the meeting were MPs Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), Nixon Korir (Lang’ata) and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru.The DP said the Msambweni by-election opened a new chapter in Kenyan politics.""It is no longer about the big name that we carry. Not the people in power that we are connected to. It is about our hard work, commitment and how we address the issues and aspirations of the ordinary people,"" Ruto said.Bader was on Tuesday sworn-in as a Member of Parliament days after clinching the seat.The short swearing-in ceremony was presided over by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi.Bader who contested as an Independent candidate trounced Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) candidate Omar Boga after garnering 15,251 votes against Omar’s 10,444.Bader said he will focus on completing the late MP Suleiman Dori's agenda.The MP-elect said he was grateful for the support of Ruto and his allies had given him.""The DP stood with me when ODM humiliated me. His close allies like Johnson Muthama, Boni Khalwale, and Hassan Omar have been here with me all through to ensure that I won. I know I can not repay them but will always pray for them,"" he said.The by-election which arose following the death of Suleiman Dori was seen as a battle between DP Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga.Ruto threw his weight behind Bader after the ruling Jubilee Party announced that it would not field a candidate.Ruto supported Bader as part of a strategy to test his political clout at the Coast.Shortly after Bader's victory, Ruto congratulated the MP-elect saying the win cemented the trust in God and the people.""Democracy and people power has triumphed. Watu was Msambweni Mungu awabariki!"" Ruto tweeted."
827,Economic crisis: 70% of Kenyans worse off than last year - poll,"Seventy per cent of Kenyans feel that their current economic situation is worse than it was this time last year, a new poll has revealed.According to the latest poll by Tifa, Kenya is facing a double crisis coupled with the coronavirus pandemic and loss of livelihoods.However, half of Kenyans (50 per cent) are hopeful that their personal and family economic situation will be better in 2021 with 25 per cent feeling that it will be worse.Nine per cent of the respondents expect their situation to remain the same while the rest (16 pre cent) are not sure about this.Those affected the most and who expressed the highest negative sentiment regarding their economic situation are those living in Nairobi.The capital has had the highest number of Covid-19 cases and has suffered the brunt of the restrictions brought about by the pandemic the longest.In terms of gender, Male respondents at 53 per cent are more optimistic than women (47 per cent) about their personal and family economic conditions for 2021.In terms of age, the youth (18-34 years) at 55 per cent are more optimistic about the future than older people at 43 per cent.In terms of regions, residents of North Eastern are the most optimistic (72 per cent) about 2021, followed by those in Central (55 per cent) and Nairobi (54 per cent).Those least optimistic about next year are residents of Coast (45 per cent), Western (46 per cent) and Nyanza (47 per cent).Earlier this month, Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani announced that taxes cut during the start of the pandemic will revert to normal from January 1, 2021.Yatani said the move was necessitated by the ease of some of the containment measures and subsequent resumption of normalcy.The CS said that effective from January 1, 2021, the Corporate Tax rate will revert to 30 per cent from the current 25 per cent.The individual Income of Tax rate (VAT) will revert to 16 per cent from the current 25 per cent and the Value Added Tax rate VAT will revert to 16 per cent from the current 14 per cent.The tax relief measures were deemed necessary to support Kenyan businesses and to provide critical relief to the most vulnerable in society.The government's restrictive measures to contain the pandemic continue to have negative economic impacts on businesses and workers. The country has witnessed job cuts across various sectors, and incomes of companies and available working hours for staff have fallen significantly.As a result, Kenyans do not have enough money to buy food, and other basics due to reduced earnings.According to the poll, these are some of the reasons why Kenyans feel that their personal financial situation was worse in 2020.The national poll was conducted between December 8-19 with a sample size of 1,550 respondents.Data was collected through telephone interviews with a margin of error of +/- 2 per cent."
828,Why Sonko-Wanjiru alliance could complicate city governor contest,"Former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru is positioning herself as the Tangatanga candidate for Nairobi governor and could be backed by impeached Mike Sonko. With the support of Sonko and Deputy President William Ruto, Bishop Wanjiru, who heads the Jesus is Alive Ministries, could complicate the race for the handshake principals. Wanjiru has declared interest in the gubernatorial job and announced she will be running on DP William Ruto’s 'hustler nation' platform. Sources intimated to the Star that the IEBC has scheduled the vote for February 18.Sonko and Wanjiru are veteran Nairobi politicians and are seen as popular, especially in informal settlements. On Monday, hardly four days after Sonko's dramatic impeachment in the Senate, the flashy politician embarked on a food distribution drive ahead of Christmas in Starehe constituency.He announced that his caravan would traverse all the city's  17 constituencies.Political pundits say that if the handshake side does not plan well, they could be headed for a tough political war.The team also fears that the political battle will divide Nairobians and muddy the waters for the Building Bridges Initiative  Wanjiru’s recent vicious attacks on nominated MP Maina Kamanda is a sign of the high stakes in the by-election. The cleric said nothing would stop her from bidding for governor and dared Kamanda to bring the fight on.She cited her victory against Kamanda in the race for Starehe MP, saying she would repeat the same at the county level.“I beat you (Kamanda) twice and you surrendered…you want us to fight again in Nairobi…with Ruto behind us? If you want a fight, come we fight here,” she said.She won against the former rival in the 2007 election and retained the seat in a by-election held in 2010 following the annulment of her victory. Sonko has already indicated he is ready to back another candidate if he is not cleared to vie.“I have accepted the impeachment, but the people have not impeached me. Even if I don’t vie, we will know who will be governor of Nairobi,” he said.Former Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna and former Nairobi City clerk Philip Kisia are among names featuring on the handshake side.Some quarters are also pushing the team to consider Makadara MP George Aladwa, also ODM chairman Nairobi county, as a possible match against the Sonko side.There are also mentions of businessman Jimnah Mbaru. Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo's name has also been mentioned but he has denied having an interest in the seat, adding, however, that some people want him to run.Aladwa said Wanjiru cannot complicate the matrix for Uhuru and Raila citing her loss to Kidero. He said Nairobi votes along ethnic lines, with Kikuyus, Luhyas, Luos, Kisii and Kambas having the greatest numbers.Aladwa said the handshake side is strong considering the more than 500,000 BBI signatures collected in the county. “The Sonko factor does not scare us. Nairobians need a new governor who can finish the remaining term and support the NMS.”Kamanda, for his part, said: “We will have a candidate. Nairobi is a handshake city, take that to the bank. There are no two ways about it.”But political commentator Danstan Omari told the Star that times have changed for both Uhuru and Raila, hence Sonko’s candidate, whoever it will be, will carry the day.He said the 2017 scenario where the Kikuyu vote was solidly behind Uhuru whereas the Luo and Western were behind Raila is no more.Omari holds that the Kikuyu vote has migrated tremendously from Uhuru, while the Luhya vote has migrated from Raila's side.He said voters are likely to back the former Nairobi governor’s choice—by extension Ruto’s—as his donations have come in handy for poor residents hit by Covid-19.“It is Ruto and Sonko who have been 'feeding' them. The Wheelbarrow Movement resonates in Nairobi more than anywhere. If the two unite, then you have almost 70 per cent of voters behind the candidates they will support,” Omari said.He added that Sonko is likely to throw his name in the race to get sympathy backing should he not be cleared by the IEBC.“Sonko’s support base will be sympathetic to whomever he will endorse. The question would be: is Ruto likely to come out in the open if Uhuru nominates somebody?”Martin Andati, a political observer, said the handshake side already faces the complication of running on a joint ticket.“There is an unfinished business on their side. The handshake is not a party. If they mix, one person has to resign from either of the parties,” Andati said.On this, Omari said Wiper may be given preference since ODM has yet to enter into a coalition deal with Jubilee.Weighing in on the issue, however, Dismas Mokua, a political risk analyst, said President Kenyatta, Raila, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula will determine who becomes the next governor.He said Wanjiru does not command any serious political capital in Nairobi. “If she did, she would be an MCA, MP, senator, or governor on her own motion.”“Sonko became governor following his Jubilee ticket. The moment Uhuru, Raila, Musalia and Weta mobilise their bases, it would be a wrap.”He added that the Tangatanga side has no numbers in Nairobi, hence may not get a smooth sailing as may be perceived by some quarters.“The Kenyan voter is emotional, irrational and held hostage by their respective tribal leaders,” Mokua said, adding that Nairobi residents may not want another raw deal."
829,"Nairobi arboretum's toilets, jogging paths to be repaired by March","The Nairobi Arboretum Park’s jogging paths and toilets will soon be rebuilt to meet the needs of visitors.Radisson Blu Hotel and Residence, Arboretum and the Kenya Forest Service under the Friends of Nairobi Arboretum have signed a Sh12 million deal for the project.The forest service has engaged with the Community Forest Associations for similar projects.Naema Construction director Naman Opiata, Radisson Blu Hotel and Residence, Arboretum chairman Rasik Kantaria and KFS deputy conservator Margret Wanjiru signed for their organisations on Tuesday.Kantaria said the project will start in the first week of January 2021 and is expected to be ready for commissioning by early March.""The park is a beehive of activity, especially during weekends and holidays. We need Nairobians to access good sanitation services at the park. Modernisation of paths will make them more accessible to even the disabled people,"" he said.A recent inventory and assessment by the UN Habitat showed that public spaces in Nairobi, including the arboretum, are substandard.The Habitat's report released in September said the design of, for instance, walkways, entrances and amenities such as toilets should promote access to and inclusivity in public spaces.“In Nairobi, however, public spaces are not friendly to persons living with disability. Only 19.8 per cent of the public open spaces have inclusive infrastructure — pedestrian infrastructure that suits all users.”In line with this, the state has targeted other green spaces, besides the arboretum, for revival. They include Karura Forest, City Park and Ngong Road Forest.Most Nairobi parks have registered low visitation since the country was hit by the coronavirus, but KFS continues to register a huge influx of people visiting urban forests and green spaces.Project chaperon Kantaria said the partnership is in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s speech on the World Environment Day when he urged stakeholders to partner to boost botanical diversity.“This project, which is part of the hotel’s corporate social responsibility, will ensure the park’s botanical and zoological diversity is maintained. Our green spaces need to be well-preserved,” he said.The Nairobi Arboretum was established in 1907 and currently has 30 hectares of forest coverage. It has more than 200 species of indigenous and exotic trees and plants."
830,"No annual kuku, goat auctions for Ruto as he retreats to Sugoi home","The coronavirus has forced Deputy President William Ruto to scale down events that often characterise his Christmas breaks.“The DP has scaled down most of his annual activities that normally feature in his diary as this time of the year due to Covid-19,” Ruto’s director of communication Emmanuel Talam told the Star on the phone.On a day like today, Ruto would be rubbing dust off his suit at the goat auction in Kimalel, Baringo county.But this year, the annual event that was revived eight years ago, is off his diary.Baringo North MP William Cheptumo said after the revival, the auction had become an annual event that residents in Baringo county looked forward to. In previous years, close to 5,000 goats would be sold a day, the MP said. A goat would be sold for as much as Sh14,000 Cheptumo said the auction is an economic empowerment programme like no other in the county that breeds some of the best indigenous goats in the East African region. “It is unfortunate that we are not having it this year because of the coronavirus. For the years we have had it, it has been so successful. As one of the leaders from the county, I want to thank the DP for faithfully attending the auction,” he told the Star.The former chairman of Justice and Legal Affairs in the National Assembly said Baringo residents started fattening their goats in January in preparation for the event. Cheptumo said residents who rely on the auction to raise school fees and buy farm inputs will suffer.""This is an auction where we normally make up to Sh20 million. Schools are opening in January, and many parents won't have school fees considering that the economy has been affected by Covid-19. The government should waive the payments,” he said.The MP said there was a proposal by the Deputy President for the county government to consider a virtual goat auction.Last year, the DP also revived 'Kambi ya Kuku' in his Uasin Gishu home county. He helped poultry farmers auction their fowl. On Wednesday, the DP is expected to host a delegation of political, religious and community leaders from Busia county in his Sugoi home, Uasin Gishu county.On Thursday, he is expected to accompany President Uhuru Kenyatta for the state funeral of Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama.It is not yet clear if, on the same Thursday, he will manage to grace the annual “hustlers” football tournament which normally takes place in rotation among Western counties.The DP started his countryside life on Monday by hosting children from several orphanages in Uasin Gishu county as he celebrated his 54th birthday.On Tuesday, he called off some meetings to create time to attend the funerla of Machakos Senator Boniface Kabaka."
831,Senators want law to guide trial of impeached governors,"Senators are pushing for the enactment of a law to guide the trial process for governors impeached by their county assemblies.The lawmakers said the current provisions do not give the ‘solemnity’ to the trial of impeached governors as they are rigid and do not give them enough time to hear the cases.They spoke during the hearing of former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s removal confirmation in the Senate. Senators confirmed Sonko's impeachment and removed him from office on Thursday night.“We must revise these rules. We must look at the Act again. My belief is that, so far, we have not given the solemnity to this process,” Minority leader James Orengo said.Currently, there is no standalone law that provides for the procedure of removing an impeached governor from office.Instead, the procedure is provided for in Section 33 of the County Governments Act, 2012.The section states that the Senate shall hear the impeachment charges and arguments in plenary or through a committee of 11 members.For a committee, the law gives the panel 10 days within which to hear a case and report its verdict back to the House on whether it finds the particulars of the allegations against the governor to have been substantiated.In the case of the plenary, the House has a maximum of two days to determine the case.Sonko’s case was heard and determined in the plenary after Majority leader Samuel Poghisio declined to move a motion to debate the formation of a committee.“I believe that we must revise the rules, amend the County Government Act in relation to the impeachment. I want to persuade the House that a committee process is probably better,” Orengo said.He added, “In the USA, they do not have a provision for the committee system. What they have in the law is plenary but they have found out over time that plenary does not do justice to the grounds and the seriousness of grounds.”Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi reiterated the need to re-address the procedure of impeachment.He expressed fears that the House risks compromising a very important tenet and virtue of the process – believability.“If these processes continue then eventually it is clear to somebody who is following that we are not able to prosecute the matter to its detail because of lack of time,” he said.Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura said the current provisions are not succinct as they leave it to the whims of the members to decide the route to use to confirm a governor's removal.“We really need an impeachment procedure law, so that we are very clear that it is not whimsically possible to just make a determination as to whether we have a case for a plenary or for the committee based on what may have happened by a certain committee or certain persuasions of the moment,” he said.Nyamira Senator Okong'o Mogeni also emphasised the need for legislation. “It is important that in the eyes of anybody who comes before us to see that not only has he or she been subjected to a process that is fair, but that he or she has also received justice,” he said.Edited by Henry Makori"
832,State mulls flights restriction over new virus strain,"The government is mulling reintroduction of travel restrictions amid reports of a variant of Covid-19 reported in the UK and South Africa.Various state agencies are in discussions to reconsider a possible restriction of international flights in an effort to curb the spread.The development comes as the country recorded 154 new positive cases from a sample size of 3,262 tested in 24 hours.The new cases raise the country’s virus caseload to 94,768 from cumulative samples of 1,014,287 tested since March.The discovery of the new strain sowed new panic over a pandemic that has killed almost 1.7 million people worldwide.“On travel advisories, there is nothing that is not on the table. As you know various actors are involved in discussing and observing global trends. So far we have not taken the measures but we are in discussion and looking at what is happening across the world,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said on Tuesday.Already, the British government has issued an advisory against unnecessary travel by its citizens in the wake of the reports about the new strain.“We have taken that into consideration as we make our own arrangements and consider what further measures to take and probably in the next 48 hours we will be making further announcements,” he said.“It is possible for us because of this variant virus to start taking other measures. We are reconsidering the possibilities of what to do about the flights. We are entering back into a situation that is unknown.”Countries across the globe have shut borders and banned travel between the UK over fears about a highly infectious new coronavirus strain, causing travel chaos.The strain, referred to by some experts as the B.1.1.7 lineage, is not the first new variant of the pandemic to emerge but is said to be up to 70 per cent more transmissible than the previously dominant strain in the UK.Three more patients succumbed to the virus on Tuesday, raising the death toll in the country to 1,647.Nairobi continued to lead in the number of cases after recording 50 new cases followed by Kilifi with 20, Kiambu 15, Marsabit 10, Turkana 10, Busia nine and Meru eight.The CS further confirmed that 835 patients were admitted in various health facilities countrywide  with 3,740 on the home based isolation and care.Forty three patients were in the intensive care unit, 22 of whom were on ventilator support and 20 on supplemental oxygen and one under observation.Edited by Henry Makori"
833,Gideon: A big 'bullet' coalition in the offing,"Kanu chairman Gideon Moi has said a super coalition is being forged to face off with Deputy President William Ruto in 2022. He called it a ""bullet"".The Baringo senator said that ongoing talks will ensure the country's six bigwigs forge a strong vehicle to produce the fifth president, succeeding Uhuru Kenya.Gideon, the scion of former President Daniel Moi, said the team to be birthed after the Building Bridges Initiative referendum will travel the rest of the journey to the August 22 General Election.“We have a journey. The first journey is to ensure BBI is passed and support President Uhuru Kenyatta,"" Gideon told a gathering of Kanu members in Samburu on Saturday. Gideon speech was broadcast live and shared in a WhatsApp group.He said they are friends with ODM chief Raila Odinga, ANC's Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula and Council of Governors chairman Wycliffe Oparanya of Kakamega.Gideon, the Kanu boss, is the sixth member of the future coalition.""We are a huge team and we are all on the same journey... And about the future, don’t worry, we will produce one bullet. The bullet will lead us. We don't fear,” he stated. The BBI Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2020 has proposed the creation of the position of a prime minister and two deputies, as well as the existing president and deputy president's posts.Some Cabinet ministers will also be picked from amongst members of the National Assembly. This would make it easy for presidential candidates to share out top positions among regional kingpins.The question complicating the touted coalition, however, is who will take which position.Already, Mudavadi has said he will settle for nothing less than president.Both Raila and Gideon are the two leading lights in the Uhuru succession matrix and the Star has learnt that the Kenyatta family is working on a formula to have them on one ticket in 2022.The two have not formally declared their candidature, but in the last few months their heightened political activities have left little doubt about their plans.It is understood President Kenyatta is torn between which of the two should assume his mantle.On one hand, it was Raila who entered into a handshake with him in March 2018 and the two are the brains behind the push to amend the 2010 Constitution to expand the Executive.Considering the support the former Prime Minister has given to President Kenyatta, he is widely expected to return the favour and endorse him.Uhuru is under pressure from Kikuyu elders - who have held several strategy meetings with Raila - to endorse the ODM chief as away of settling a historical debt between his father Jomo Kenyatta and Raila's father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga.Raila's father served as Jomo vice president but the pair fell out and Jaramogi quit in 1966, sparking a political rivalry that persisted between the Luo and Kikuyu over the years.On the other hand, Gideon is looking to Uhuru to endorse him in return of what Mzee Moi did for the young Kenyatta.Moi brought Uhuru into the political limelight in 2001 by nominating him to Parliament and subsequently appointing him to the Cabinet as the Local Government minister.In 2002, he picked Uhuru as his preferred successor.Uhuru and his family have over time been very supportive of Gideon, and by extension, the greater Moi family.ANC deputy party leader Ayub Savula confirmed talks are ongoing between Gideon, Mudavadi and Wetang'ula.He said, however, he is not aware if the same conversation is being held with other politicians.“Things are taking shape behind the scenes and in the months to come, Kenyans will be able to see the direction we will take. It will be a strong alliance. The Lugari MP said Gideon and Mudavadi have already agreed they will jointly support an ANC candidate in the by-election in Matungu constituency, Kakamega. Then ANC will support a Ford Kenya candidate in a similar poll in Kabuchai constituency.“We have spoken with Gideon and we have agreed to work as a strong team. Our candidate will triumph,” he said.Tiaty MP William Kamket said Uhuru, Gideon, Raila, Kalonzo, Mudavadi, Wetang'ula and other politicians are working together on the succession plan.Gideon's close ally said it will depend on who among the five the President will select as his successor.“President Kenyatta is at liberty to support anyone to succeed him. If we're lucky enough to earn his support, that would be an added advantage. But we're not resting on our laurels waiting for endorsement. The final and most important endorsement is by the people of Kenya,” Kamket told the Star on the phone.“As a Kanu member and a resident of Baringo, my first port of call is my party leader and neighbour, Gideon Moi,” he said.He said the team that has come together to first ensure BBI sails through will also slam the brakes on Ruto’s brigade.“That is the political formation pre, through and post BBI. It is the formation that has naturally come about to stop an insidious, divisive, theft-prone group called Tangatanga from misleading our youth and country,” he said.Ruto allies dismissed the coalition, calling it 'an inconsequential grouping of the dynasties'.Kimilili MP Didmas Barasa said the 2022 presidential race will have dynasties on one hand and hustlers on the other.“Kenyans have advanced. Those who still believe in tribal formations are living in the past. Gideon and Raila can collect as many political rejects as they want.""We the hustlers are ready to face them. They may have money but we have God and the ordinary Kenyans who are tired by being used by these dynasties,” he said.Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua asked why Raila has been visiting the homes of individuals in Mt Kenya instead of seeking to address the people.He said Raila is against most of the things the people of vote- rich Central region want and are being championed by Ruto.“Raila has the democratic right to move and seek votes anywhere in the Republic of Kenya. However, he should be made aware we already have our candidate in William Samoei Ruto.""Raila is against harambees, building churches and other development projects that Ruto supports,” Gachagua told the Star.“Now that elections are around the corner and the very same people who have been criticising DP’s engagement with the people, the DP who has been bringing us projects, are coming to ask for votes. NO way. We are passed that,” the MP said.(Edited by V. Graham)"
834,Agency that purged quacks keen to improve healthcare,"It is now three years since the Health ministry started enacting the Health Act in a bid to implement the Constitution. The Act became effective on September 20, 2017.The Act provided for the establishment of various institutions, including the Kenya Health Professions Oversight Authority (KHPOA), mandated with several functions.On the first anniversary of the authority, the CEO Dr Jackson Kioko spoke to the Star about the journey. Kioko doubles up as the Director Medical Service.Kindly introduce KHPOA and tell us the gaps in health regulation the authority seeks to address?KHPOA was established with very obvious reasons. There were challenges of providing the quality of care, regulating the health professionals and their training, how they are licensed, how they practise, how they relate with the health facilities and also how they relate with the communities and the patients.Now these were the gaps that were realised that the ministry and the health sector has not been addressing. And therefore, the need for the KHPOA to come and look at these challenges, these gaps from far above and to see how they can be sorted out.In what ways has the establishment of KHPOA improved health services?  The successes are many, the challenges are also many. But remember that establishing a new institution is very challenging. Ensuring that both the organisational and legal structures are in place really takes a lot of time.We have convened all the regulatory bodies that are recognised under the laws of Kenya and sat down with them. We mapped out all the regulatory bodies, all the training institutions, the universities and the colleges and the professional associations because we will be working with them.But above all, we realised that the first thing we needed to do is to take an inventory of everyone who is providing services in this country, whether it is private or public, whether is a clinic or nursing home. So we embarked on a very serious exercise of doing joint health inspections.We were targeting to reach 11,600 health facilities, we managed 11,400 the rest we could not trace them because it is an exercise that began in July 2019 and ended in January this year. So we did 98 per cent of what we had targeted to do.We closed 1,200 clinics and facilities. This because either they were not registered or the people who were working there were not qualified. We are supposed to have developed the legal instruments for the authority. We have already finished drafting those regulations with the support of the AG's office and the legal team from the ministry, and soon we are going to subject them to stakeholders because they have to go through that process before they become legal tools to be used.We have also developed the organisation, the staffing and the grading structure of the authority, which is very key in recruitment and career progression.What is the role of KHPOA in the UHC agenda?When we came in as an authority, we were also given a task to make sure the hospitals, health centres and dispensaries, especially in the public sector, are actually prepared towards the UHC. So we have done a lot of inspection, preparation of hospitals and ensured that things are in place for the UHC.Do you have a role as an authority in the fight against Covid-19 as the virus ravages the country?We are the ones who have been spearheading the facility preparedness in the counties for Covid-19, so what we have been doing is that because we are tasked to carry out joint inspections, the authority has been providing leadership in the inspection and preparedness in counties towards the establishment of the isolation centres and quarantine centres.How do you handle patient complains against health professionals?One of the functions of the authority is to receive and facilitate conflict resolutions from patients or aggrieved parties or disputes. We have developed regulations to this function and provided procedures for handling and receiving these complaints from the facility level itself. Let it be handled at that level first. If not, let it be handled at the respective regulatory body, but in the event the authority is dissatisfied with how this is handled, the authority shall take over that investigation/the handling of that complaint. The facility is supposed to be giving the conclusion of every case they handle to the authority for scrutiny and to certify that this complaint was efficiently and correctly handled. The same will apply to the regulatory authority.There has been a lot of agitation from health professionals for the formation of a Health Service Commission. Do you think its formation will create overlaps in your work?No. What is being proposed in the HSC is totally different because it is not talking about service delivery. It is not talking about the issues of quality, the issues of training or about the regulatory space. It is talking about the human resource for health, the issues of job opportunities, the issues of employment, their welfare, their salaries, remunerations, promotions, transfers. That is human resources. In fact, it would affect more the Kenya Human Resource Advisory Council. For us, we are okay.Some hospitals and medical practitioners are said to deny patients emergency services for lack of money. Has KHPOA made any attempt to rectify this?The good thing is I am all aware about the entire health sector, the challenges it has gone through and the issues that have affected it, whether in the private or the public sector. So when we are seated here, drafting guidelines and policies, we are actually using the experience we have already seen is affecting the health sector.There is a code of conduct for standards of health facilities. What is it that health facilities have to do or what is it we expect them to do in regards to providing care and especially emergency care? Especially in situations where patients may not have the finances to settle the healthcare costs. And what are the penalties you are actually going to go through if you fail to provide a service to a patient?Improper training is often blamed for malpractices and unethical behaviour in healthcare. What are the plans in place to ensure quality health training?We have developed regulations on standards of training on where the training standards can be compromised, and we are going to start using them the moment they become law. But we are aware that, of course, patients die either because of misdiagnosis or maybe they die because of wrong treatment, wrong procedures, or delays, even initiating that treatment or even delays in referrals, and we have taken all these into consideration when we are doing our regulations.What are the future short-term and long-term plans for the authority?We are training the county health inspectors at least three or four in each county, who then would be involved in visiting various facilities to check on the implementation of quality improvement to tell us which facility is not doing well, which one needs to be supported or which one needs to be closed. They would not be closing because the closing is the mandate of the authority, but they will only be advising, they will only be supporting the teams working in hospitals on how to improve on services.Edited by T Jalio"
835,Hospitals to be rated based on quality of care,"The government is introducing a new rating system for all healthcare facilities. At the moment, hospitals and health facilities are graded in terms of levels, but the government now says the system does not only cause confusion but makes the National Hospital Insurance Fund to lose a lot of money.It was discovered that in the current categorisation, some hospitals, clinics and dispensaries were given higher than they were supposed to get. As a result, they have been getting higher re-imbursements, yet their services are not commensurate to that, says the Kenya Health Professions Oversight Authority CEO Dr Jackson Kioko said.“We downgraded 800 hospitals and this exercise was every good because then NHIF realised they have been losing money because of this kind of a situation. A small clinic is given a level 4, so you get a re-imbursement of a level 4 and then you see it is NHIF to lose,” he said.“So the authority is coming to be an independent body. It would go out there with the lens of an authority and see the standards, grade the hospitals, provide the information to the CS for gazettement, and all that.”Under the new plan, in addition to the levels, healthcare facilities will be given a star rating, similar to the one in the hotel industry. This will be based purely on the quality of care being provided in the facility.Dr Kioko said most complaints the public has raised about the hospitals are about the quality, not being treated well, untimely services or that services were inadequate.“For example, if I go to Nairobi Hospital and I give it a level 5, and I go to Mama Lucy and I give it a level 4, now we said moving forward, the type of categorising or grading is good, but it needs to be improved.“We want to grade or categorise hospitals based on the quality of services you are providing. So we are going to combine the two approaches and say, if it is Nairobi Hospital, we will give it a level 5 but then we look at the quality of care and say you are three star or two star.”This will help Kenyans to have information and make informed decisions on where they want to get their healthcare resources, in a move the CEO says will bring about competition among healthcare providers, hence improving the quality of care.By getting a two star, for instance, it will mean the health facility has a long way to go in terms of provision of quality care to Kenyans.Once the hospital has been inspected, the teams will then put a sticker outside that hospital which is visible to everybody, indicating the level and star rating.“We would have educated the public so much to be able to know if I am going to this hospital and is a two star, what does it mean to me, so that you can make your own choice because the quality of care in that hospital has been inspected and has been certified.”Edited by T Jalio"
